So if I didn't know to follow the order of operations and just did it from left to right, I might say:

The answer is 19.

But if I did know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would know to solve it differently. I would do the calculations inside the parentheses first, then the multiplication, and finally the addition and subtraction from left to right:

First do the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7. Then multiply by 4. So 4 times 7 equals 28.

Then add 12, so 28 + 12 equals 40.

Finally, multiply 2 by 3 to get 6 and subtract from 40. So 40 - 6 equals 34.

She used a word that sounded like a ladder or something... Oh, yeah, ""order of operations!""

So, the first thing you do is parentheses - that's like doing the math inside the hugs first because they're really important. Then, you do any exponents - those are the little numbers that float in the air, but there aren't any here. After that, you have to do multiplication or division, whichever comes first when you look from left to right. And lastly, you do addition or subtraction, also from left to right.

For this problem, I'll start with the parentheses: 2 plus 5 is 7.
Next, I multiply because that comes before addition and subtraction. So I'll do 4 times 7, and that's 28. And I see another multiplication, 2 times 3 is 6.
Now, I just add and subtract everything in order, from left to right! 

So, it's 28 (from the 4 times 7) plus 12, which is 40.
And then from 40, I subtract 6 (from the 2 times 3), so that leaves me with 34.

P - Parentheses first
E - Exponents (I don't see any exponents here, so I can skip this step)
MD - Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
AS - Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Here's how I solve it step by step:

1. Solve the parentheses first:
   (2 + 5) = 7

2. Now, the equation looks like this:
   4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

3. Next, I do the multiplication:
   4 * 7 = 28
   2 * 3 = 6

   So now the equation is:
   28 + 12 - 6

4. Finally, I do the addition and subtraction from left to right:

So, first do what's inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 is 7.

Then we multiply because that comes before addition and subtraction:
4 * 7 is 28.

Now we just add and subtract from left to right:
28 + 12 is 40.
40 - (2*3) is 40 - 6 because we do the multiplication before subtraction.

Now subtract:
40 - 6 is 34.

First, I see 4*(2+5), so I'll do that part:
4*(2+5) = 4*7 because 2 plus 5 equals 7.

Next I multiply the 4 by 7, which gives me 28.

After that, I have:
28 + 12 which is 40.

And then I subtract 2 times 3 from 40. So, 2 times 3 equals 6.

Finally, subtracting 6 from 40, I get 34.

So, I think the answer is 34. But since I'm not sure about these rules, I should probably check with my teacher or someone else who knows them to make sure I did it right!","Since I'm new to this, I'll try to solve it step by step in a way that makes sense to me without any formal knowledge of order of operations. I see there are some parentheses, so I think I have to do something with them first. Inside the parentheses, it says 2+5, which is 7. I will replace the (2+5) with 7 in the problem:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, it looks like I need to do the multiplication parts before I do the addition and subtraction parts. So I will do 4 times 7, which is 28, and then 2 times 3, which is 6, then write it out again replacing the multiplications:

28 + 12 - 6

Now it looks simpler. I just need to add and subtract. So, 28 plus 12 is 40, then subtract 6 from 40, and I get 34.

The answer is 34.",34,34,34,7,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,34,1,1,1

First, I'll add the numbers in the parentheses because that seems like a good place to start:
2 + 5 equals 7.

Okay, I think I'm supposed to do the multiplication parts next because my friend said that multiplication comes before addition and subtraction. So I'm going to multiply 4 times what I got in the parentheses (which was 7), and then multiply 2 times 3:

4 times 7 equals 28,
and 2 times 3 equals 6.

Now, I just have addition and subtraction left. I just go from left to right now, right? So I add 28 and 12 which is 40, and then subtract the 6:

40 minus 6 equals 34.

So after I did all that, the answer I got is:
The answer is 34.","Since I'm in grade 6 and haven't learned about order of operations yet, I might try to solve this math problem by simply going from left to right like I read a book. So I would do each part in the order it comes, not knowing that some operations should be done before others.

Here's how I might do it without knowing PEMDAS:

First, I see 4 times (2+5), so I'd start by adding the 2 and the 5, because that's the first thing I see inside the parentheses. 2+5 is 7.

Then I'd multiply that 7 by 4, because the next thing I see is the multiplication. 4 times 7 is 28.

Next, I'd just keep going from left to right, so I would add 12 to that 28. 28 plus 12 is 40.

Then, I'd subtract 2 from the 40 because that's next in the line. 40 minus 2 is 38.

Lastly, I multiply the 3, which is at the end, by 2. 2 times 3 is 6.

But since I'm not sure about the order, I might get confused and end up just adding this 6 to the 38 instead of going back and changing any earlier steps. So, 38 plus 6 is 44.

So, not knowing PEMDAS, I might say:

The answer is 44. (But this would be incorrect because the actual order of operations wasn't followed!).","Oh, my teacher just told us about this thing called PEMDAS, which is short for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). I think we're supposed to do the math inside the parentheses first, then do the multiplication and division, and then the addition and subtraction at the end.

So first, I'll add the numbers inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

So now the problem looks like this:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we do the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now the problem is:
28 + 12 - 6

And then we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

Then you multiply that by 4 because multiplication comes next, so 4 times 7 is 28. After that, you have to do addition and subtraction from left to right. So you add 28 to 12 to get 40, and then you subtract 2 times 3 which is 2*3 = 6 from 40. So 40 minus 6 is 34. That should be the answer I think.

The answer is 34.","Oh okay, so even though I'm not sure about all these math rules, I remember my teacher talking about something like saying 'Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally' to help us with these kinds of problems. She was talking about parentheses being important. So I'm gonna start with the parentheses first because it feels like they're kind of like a mini math problem inside the bigger one.

So the part inside the parentheses is 2+5, which is 7.

Now I have 4 times 7, plus 12, minus 2 times 3.

I know my multiplication tables pretty well, so 4 times 7 is 28.

So now my problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2 times 3.

I need to do the times part next because that's also like a mini math problem. So 2 times 3 is 6.

Now I just have 28 plus 12 minus 6.

28 plus 12 is 40, and then 40 minus 6 is 34.

So, the answer is 34.","Since I just learned about order of operations, let's try to solve this together using the PEMDAS rule. PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). Here's how we apply it to the problem:

First, solve the expression inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

Now, let's look at the multiplication and division parts from left to right:
4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now we'll rewrite the expression with those results:
28 + 12 - 6

Next, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:
28 + 12 = 40

First, I should do what's inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5. 

2 + 5 equals 7.

Now I have: 4*7 + 12 - 2*3

Then I do the multiplication parts next. So 4 times 7 is 28, and 2 times 3 is 6.

Now it looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

After that, I do the adding and subtracting. So, 28 + 12 is 40.

The answer is 34.","Oh, I think this is like a puzzle! We have to do things in a special order, just like when you do stuff in games. My friend said you have to do the stuff inside the brackets first. So let's see...

Now the problem looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, I think you do the times—multiplication things. So, 4 times 7 is 28, and 2 times 3 is 6. 

Now it's like this: 28 + 12 - 6.

Then, I do the adding and subtracting from the left to the right. So, 28 plus 12 is 40, and then take away 6 from 40, which is 34.

So, the answer is 34.","Okay, since I'm a grade 6 student and I don't know about order of operations, I might try to solve this just by going from left to right. So here's what I would do:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

If I just continue left to right:

4 * 7 is 28, then I add 12, which is 40. 
Next, 40 minus 2 is 38, and then I have to multiply the last part.
38 times 3... but this is a bit tricky, because I don't usually see a number right next to a multiplication. Maybe, I think, I should just multiply the 2 from before by 3 first, which is 6.

So, if I take 40 (from earlier) and subtract 6 (2 * 3), I would get 34.

So my final answer would probably be: The answer is 34.

Next, I think I have to do the multiplication before the addition and subtraction because multiplication is like a bigger deal or something.

So, 4 times 7 is 28.

Now my problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.

Now I just have to add and subtract in the order it comes, I think that’s how it goes.

28 plus 12 is 40.

And then 40 minus 6 is 34.

Hmm, I think the P stands for parentheses, so maybe that means I do the stuff inside those curved lines first.

So, I'll add the numbers inside the parentheses first. That's 2 + 5, which equals 7. Now my problem looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, I think the E is for exponents, but there aren't any in this problem. So, I'll skip that.

The M is for multiplication, and I see two spots where I need to multiply. First is 4 * 7, which is 28, and second is 2 * 3, which is 6. Now my problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.

I think the D is for division, but I don't have any division here, so I'll skip that too.

The A is for addition, and the S is for subtraction. I can do those last two steps in order. So, I'll add 28 + 12. That's 40. Then, I subtract 6 from 40, which is 34.

Alright, so in that problem, first, I have to add the numbers in the parentheses:

2 + 5 = 7

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

So now our problem looks like this:

28 + 12 - 6

So, I think I should do the math inside the parentheses first because it seems like a separate little problem. Inside the parentheses, I have 2 + 5, so I'll add those together.

2 + 5 = 7

Now, I replace the parentheses with the result:

So, 28 plus 12 is:

28 + 12 = 40

40 - 6 = 34

She said that when you see math problems with different things to do like multiplying and adding, you have to do some things before others.

First, we have:
2 + 5

I know that's 7. Then we multiply that by 4 because that's what's outside the bracket:
4 * 7

And 4 times 7 is 28. 

Now, let's look at the rest of the problem:
28 + 12 - 2 * 3

My sister said we have to do the multiplying before we do the adding or subtracting. So, we have to do 2 times 3 next:
2 * 3

That's 6. Now, we replace that in the problem:

Then, I see a subtraction, 40 - 2, which would give me 38.

Lastly, I see another multiplication, 2 * 3, which equals 6. I think I have to subtract that from 38.

Now, what we have left is:
28 + 12 - 6

Finally, we do addition and subtraction from left to right:
28 + 12 is 40, and then take away 6, we get 40 - 6 which equals 34.

So, I think the answer is 34. I hope that's right!

So we have:

4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3

First, I'll add the numbers inside the parentheses:

2 + 5 = 7

Now the problem looks like this:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I'm pretty sure we do the multiplication before the addition or subtraction. So I'll multiply 4 times 7, and also 2 times 3:

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now, our problem looks like this:

28 + 12 - 6

Finally, I think we just go from left to right doing the addition and subtraction. So let's add 28 and 12 first:

28 + 12 = 40

Now subtract 6:

40 - 6 = 34

2 + 5 = 7

Now, I do the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28
and 2 * 3 = 6

After that, I do the addition and subtraction, from left to right:
28 + 12 = 40

Lastly, I subtract the 6:
40 - 6 = 34

So, the final answer is 34.","Okay, so I'm not sure about all the rules, but I think we should probably do the stuff inside the parentheses first because it's like doing the inside part of a problem before you can do the outside part.

So we have 2 + 5 inside the parentheses. That's easy! 2 plus 5 is 7. 

Then I'd probably do the multiplication next because it seems like bigger operations than adding or subtracting. So we'd do 4 times that 7 we just got from inside the parentheses, which is 28.

Now the problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Then, I guess we just go from left to right? So add 12 to 28, which makes 40. And finally, we take that 2 times 3, which is like 2 groups of 3, which is 6.

40 minus 6 is 34.

So I would add the 2 plus 5 together which is 7. Then it says to multiply that by 4, so that would be 28. 

After that, we have to add 12 to that number, so 28 plus 12 is 40. Then it says to subtract 2 times 3. Multiplying 2 by 3 is 6, so we take away 6 from 40. That leaves us with 34.

So I think the answer would be, ""The answer is 34.""","Oh, I think my teacher mentioned something about doing math problems in a certain order so that everyone gets the same answer. I remember she talked about doing what's inside the parentheses first, then doing multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction last. I remember she used the phrase ""Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally"" to help us remember the order, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). We don't have exponents in this problem, so I don't need to worry about that part.

Let's try to solve it using that order:

1. First, solve the parentheses (2+5)
   2 + 5 = 7

2. Then do the multiplication and division from left to right:
   4 * (the result from step 1): 4 * 7 = 28
   2 * 3 = 6

3. Now, do the addition and subtraction from left to right:
   Start with the first number, then add and subtract in order:
   (result from the first multiplication) + 12 - (result from the second multiplication)
   28 + 12 - 6
   
   Do the addition first:
   28 + 12 = 40
   
   Now subtract:
   40 - 6 = 34

So, after using the order of operations, I got the answer:

The answer is 34.","Oh, so I learned something cool in math class! It's called PEMDAS and it's like a secret code to solve problems like this. It stands for:

- P for Parentheses (stuff inside the round brackets)
- E for Exponents (like if there was a 2 to the power of 3 or something, but we don't have that here)
- MD for Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
- AS for Addition and Subtraction (also from left to right)

So let's break it down!

First, we do the Parentheses:
4 * (2+5) becomes 4 * 7 because 2 + 5 is 7.

Now our problem looks like this:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next is Multiplication:
4 * 7 is 28
and 2 * 3 is 6.

So after doing that, we've got:
28 + 12 - 6

Then we just have Addition and Subtraction left, which we do from left to right:
28 + 12 is 40
And then we take away 6 from 40, which gives us 34.

Okay, so first I see there are parentheses with ""2 + 5"" inside. I'll add those numbers together first. So 2 + 5 equals 7.

Now the problem looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. 

Next, I think we need to do the multiplying before adding and subtracting. So I'll multiply 4 times 7 which is 28.

Then we also have 2 times 3 at the end, which is 6.

Now the problem is 28 + 12 - 6.

Then we do the adding and subtracting from left to right. So first, I'll add 28 and 12 which equals 40.

Lastly, I subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34.

So, I think the answer is 34.","Well, I haven't learned about the order of operations yet, but here's how I think I would solve it:

First, I see there are some parentheses, and I think we need to do what's inside them first. So I'll start with that:

2 + 5 = 7

Next, I see we need to multiply and there are addition and subtraction too. I'm not totally sure, but I think maybe we do multiplication before we do addition or subtraction. So I'll do the multiplication parts next:

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now I have:

28 + 12 - 6

I think we can just do addition and subtraction from left to right now:

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So, putting it all together, I think the answer is:

The answer is 34.","Okay, so I'm not really sure about the special rules but I think I have to do something with the numbers in the brackets first. So, if I look at the problem, there's a 2 plus 5 inside brackets. I'll add those together because that's what brackets usually mean, right?

2 + 5 equals 7.

Now the problem looks like this:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

I think I should just solve it from left to right like reading a book. So I'll multiply 4 and 7 first because that comes next.

4 * 7 equals 28.

Then we add 12 to that, right?

28 + 12 equals 40.

Then it says to subtract 2 times 3, but I'll do the 2 times 3 part first because it's like the brackets thing.

2 * 3 equals 6.

So now, we need to subtract 6 from 40.

40 - 6 equals 34.

So I think the answer is 34.

I think my friend said it stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So, first I look for parentheses! I see 2 + 5 inside parentheses, so I do that first:

2 + 5 = 7

Now I have: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Then, I should do the multiplication before addition and subtraction. I see two multiplication parts, 4 * 7 and 2 * 3:

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now, my equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

After that, I just add and subtract from left to right. So I'll add 28 to 12 first:

28 + 12 = 40

Lastly, I'll subtract 6 from 40:

40 - 6 = 34

Putting it all together, I guess the final answer is... 

The answer is 34.","Since I don't know about the order of operations, I might think that I should solve the math problem from left to right just like I read a sentence.

So, here is what I might do:

First, I would multiply 4 by 2 because that's the first operation I see.
4 * 2 = 8

Then I would add 5 to that result:
8 + 5 = 13

Next, I would add 12 to that result:
13 + 12 = 25

And finally, I would subtract 2 times 3 from that result:
25 - 2 * 3 = 25 - 6 = 19

So I would say, the answer is 19. However, I should note that when you learn the correct order of operations, you'll find out that this is not the right way to solve the problem, but since I don't know PEMDAS, this is what makes sense to me for now.","Oh, this looks like a puzzle with numbers! I think we should do the math in the part with the parentheses first because it's like when you do what's inside a gift box before dealing with the wrapping paper.

So, inside the parentheses we have 2 + 5. That's like two apples plus five apples. Easy peasy, that gives us 7 apples, I mean 7.

Now our math problem looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, I think we should do the multiplication because it's like if you have 4 bags with 7 marbles in each, you want to know how many marbles you have before you add or take any away. So 4 times 7 is like four groups of 7. Using my fingers, 7 plus 7 is 14, another 7 is 21, and one more is 28. Cool!

Now it looks like: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Let's do the other multiplication, with 2 * 3. That's like having 2 cookies, and if you get 3 times more, you'd have 6 cookies. Yum!

Now we have: 28 + 12 - 6.

Then we add 28 and 12 together because it's like having 28 stickers and getting 12 more. If you count them all up, you get 40 stickers.

So now it's: 40 - 6.

Last step! If you have 40 candies and you have to give away 6, you'd be left with 34 candies.

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,1,16,"Okay, since I'm just learning this, I've been told that there's this thing called ""PEMDAS"" that should help me remember the order in which to solve the math problem. PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So looking at the equation 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3, I will first do the operation inside the parentheses because P in PEMDAS stands for Parentheses. 

2 + 5 equals 7.

Now I have 4*7 + 12 - 2*3.

Next is Multiplication because that comes before Addition and Subtraction in PEMDAS. So, first, I'll multiply 4 by 7 which is 28 and then I'll multiply 2 by 3 which is 6.

That gives me 28 + 12 - 6.

Next up is Addition and Subtraction, which I do from left to right. 

28 + 12 is 40.

Then I subtract 6 from 40, which is 34.

So, after solving step by step according to PEMDAS, I have my final answer:

The answer is 34.","Since I don't know about the order of operations, I might just do the math from left to right as I read it. So here's how I might try to solve it:

First, I'd multiply 4 with 2 because that's the first thing I see.

4 * 2 = 8

Then I would add 5:

8 + 5 = 13

Next, I would add 12 to that:

13 + 12 = 25

And then I'd subtract 2:

25 - 2 = 23

Finally, I'd multiply by 3:

23 * 3 = 69

So I might end up thinking that the answer is 69.

However, this is not the correct way to solve the problem since I didn't use the order of operations, known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right). If I were to learn and apply those rules, the correct solution would be different.

The answer, according to my current understanding without knowing PEMDAS, is 69.","Oh geez, this looks kinda tough, but I’ll try my best. I heard my teacher say something about doing math in a special order so things don't get mixed up.

So looking at this problem, I see there are parentheses. I'll do that first:

2 + 5 = 7

Next, I think I should do the multiplication parts. So I see two multiplication things to do:

4 * 7 = 28

and

2 * 3 = 6

Now I can put those answers back into the problem instead of what was there before:

28 + 12 - 6

Next, I need to do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So I'll add first:

28 + 12 = 40

Then I'll subtract the last number:

40 - 6 = 34

First I see 4*(2 + 5), and I remember that multiplication is just repeated addition, so I should do that part first.

I would add 2 + 5, which gives me 7. Then I multiply 4 by 7, which gives me 28. So now, the problem looks like this:
28 + 12 - 2*3

Following the left-to-right approach again:
First, I would add 28 and 12 together because that's the first operation I see. This gives me 40.
Then I subtract 2*3. First, I multiply 2 by 3 which gives me 6.
So now I take the 40 and subtract 6, which leaves me with 34.

So with my current knowledge, I would say:
The answer is 34.","Okay, so even if I don't know about the order of operations yet, I might start off by doing what seems most obvious or natural to me. I know multiplication means adding the same number many times and addition is combining numbers together. 

First, I might think I should just calculate everything from left to right like I read a book.

So first, I'd multiply 4 times 2 which gives 8. Then I see a plus sign and the number 5, so I add those to get 13. Then I just keep moving to the right, adding 12 to get 25, then subtracting 2 to get 23, and lastly multiplying by 3 to get 69. 

But this feels a bit mixed up because I haven't used any brackets and in class, brackets seem important. So, maybe I should do the addition inside the bracket first because it's kind of like a 'mini task' inside the problem.

So if I follow that, I add 2 + 5 to get 7. Then I multiply that by 4 because it's like saying I have 4 groups of whatever is inside the bracket. So, 4 times 7 is 28. 

Now I have 28 plus 12, which is 40. 

Finally, I need to subtract twice the 3, which means 2 times 3, so that's 6.

Taking 6 away from 40 then gives me 34.

So first, I need to solve whatever is in the parentheses.

4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3

That's 2+5 inside the parentheses, which is 7.

Now it looks like this:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I do the multiplication parts because they come before addition and subtraction in the order of operations.

4 * 7 is 28, and 2 * 3 is 6.

So now the problem looks like this:

28 + 12 - 6

After the parentheses bit, we have 28 plus 12, which makes 40, I think. And then it says to subtract 2 times 3. I know that 2 times 3 is 6, so if we take 6 away from 40, we get 34. So I'd say...

Now the problem looks like this: \(4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3\).

Then, I think the next step is to do the multiplications before adding and subtracting. So, I'll do \(4 * 7\), which is \(28\), and then \(2 * 3\), which is \(6\).

Then we multiply 2 by 3:

2 * 3 = 6

Now our equation simplified looks like this:

28 + 12 - 6

First, we add 28 and 12:

28 + 12 = 40

Then we subtract 6 from 40:

40 - 6 = 34

So, we have done all the operations in the correct order, and our final answer is:

The answer is 34.","Oh, I learned this recently! We have to follow the order of operations that our teacher told us about. It's like a rule to know which part of a math problem to solve first. The order goes Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (also from left to right). There's this acronym PEMDAS to help us remember. Sometimes people say ""Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally"" to make it easier to remember.

So first, we look for parentheses. We do the math inside those first.

In this problem we have (2+5). Adding those together we get 7.

So now our problem looks like this: 4*7 + 12 - 2*3

Next, we don't have any exponents to worry about, so let's move on to multiplication and division.

We have two multiplication parts: 4*7 and 2*3. So let's solve those:

4*7 is 28
2*3 is 6

Now we replace those in our problem and it looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, we do addition and subtraction, from left to right. We just add 28 and 12 first, and then subtract 6:

28 + 12 is 40
40 - 6 is 34

So, the final answer is 34. 

The answer is 34.","Okay, since I'm in grade 6 and I don't know the order of operations, I might solve this step by step just like any basic math problem.

First, I see parentheses, and my teacher said we do what's in parentheses first. So I add:

2 + 5 = 7

Now, I'll replace that part of the problem with 7:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Then, I'll just go from left to right since I don't know about the right order to solve this.

First, multiply 4 and 7:

4 * 7 = 28

Now the problem looks like this:

28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I add 28 and 12:

28 + 12 = 40

So now I have:

40 - 2 * 3

Then I subtract 2 from 40 because that's the next operation in the line:

40 - 2 = 38

And I’m left with:

38 * 3

Finally, I multiply 38 by 3:

38 * 3 = 114

So, if I did everything just by going from left to right, the answer would be 114! But since I just learned that there's a special order called PEMDAS, maybe I would use that next time to do things in the right order. For now, though, I did it this way!

The answer is 114.",34,34,114,7,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,34,1,1,0

PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So based on that order, we should start with the parentheses first. Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5. 

2 + 5 = 7

Then we do the multiplication next because it comes before addition and subtraction in PEMDAS.

4 * 7 = 28

Now we perform the operations from left to right, dealing with the multiplication and then the addition and subtraction:

28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Now, we do the next multiplication:

2 * 3 = 6

And then we continue with addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40

40 - 6 = 34

Putting it all together, we get:

The answer is 34.","Okay, so I've heard from my teacher that when we do math problems, we have to follow certain rules about which parts of the problem to solve first. I think it's called the order of operations. Let me try to remember what my teacher said:

1. We do anything inside parentheses first. So I should start with what's in the parentheses: (2+5)
2. Then we do any exponents, but there aren't any in this problem.
3. After that, we do any multiplication or division, from left to right.
4. Lastly, we do any addition or subtraction, from left to right.

So let me solve the problem using these steps:

First, the parentheses:
2+5 = 7

Then, the equation looks like this without the parentheses:
4*7+12-2*3

Now, multiplication:
4*7 = 28
2*3 = 6

So we get:
28+12-6

Lastly, do the addition and subtraction from left to right:
28+12 = 40
40-6 = 34

So after using the rules, the answer looks like it should be:

The answer is 34.","Well, even though I might not know about the official ""order of operations"" or PEMDAS, I think I can still try to solve this problem just by thinking about what seems logical. 

I know that it usually makes sense to do anything inside parentheses first because it's like doing part of the problem in a little bubble. So, I'll start with that.

\(4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3\)

Inside the parentheses, \(2 + 5\) is \(7\), so I'll replace that part with a \(7\):

\(4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3\)

Now, I'll multiply next because when you have a number next to parentheses, it often means to multiply. So if I multiply \(4\) by \(7\), I get \(28\):

\(28 + 12 - 2 * 3\)

Now, it looks like I've got two things left to do: add \(12\) to \(28\), and then multiply \(2\) by \(3\). Let's do those parts:

\(28 + 12 = 40\)

and

\(2 * 3 = 6\)

Now I just need to put these back into the problem:

\(40 - 6\)

And if I subtract \(6\) from \(40\), I get:

\(34\)

4*7 is 28

Replace those into the equation:

28 + 12 = 40

Now the equation looks like this: 4*7 + 12 - 2*3.

Next, I think I should do the multiplication parts before the addition and subtraction. So, 4 times 7 is 28, and 2 times 3 is 6.

First, we add the numbers inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.

Next, we multiply that result by the 4 outside the parentheses, because I think multiplication comes before addition and subtraction. So, 4 times 7 is 28.

Then, we have 28 + 12 - 2*3. Now we do the subtraction and addition, and the multiplication. So, let's do the multiplication first, 2 times 3, which is 6.

Now we have 28 + 12 - 6. Let's put those together:

28 plus 12 is 40.
And then 40 minus 6 is 34.

So, 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3 equals 34.

The answer is 34.","Alright, I've just learned about the order of operations, which helps us know what to do first in a math problem that has more than one step!

The order we do things is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). People remember this order with the word PEMDAS.

So, let's solve the problem step by step following PEMDAS:

First, I do what's inside the parentheses (2+5):
4*(2+5)+12-2*3
= 4*7+12-2*3

Next, I do the multiplication:
4*7 = 28
2*3 = 6
So now our equation looks like this:
28+12-6

Then, I do the addition and subtraction from left to right:
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So, the problem worked out step by step is:
4*(2+5)+12-2*3
= 4*7+12-6
= 28+12-6

The answer is 34.","Well, since I don't know about the order of operations, I might just do this step by step from left to right like I read a sentence.

40 - 2 * 3

Then I subtract:
40 - 2 = 38

38 * 3

Finally, I multiply:
38 * 3 = 114

First, I see 4*(2 + 5), I think I need to do the multiplication part first, just because it seems grouped together.

So, 4 times (2 + 5) is 4 times 7 because 2 plus 5 is 7. That means 4 times 7 is 28. 

Then, I have 28 + 12 - 2*3. 

Next, I would just go left to right again.

28 + 12 is 40.

Then I have 40 - 2*3.

40 minus 2 is 38. 

Then 38 times 3... that’s like saying 30 times 3 plus 8 times 3.

So, 30 times 3 is 90 and 8 times 3 is 24.

90 plus 24 is...114.

So, I think the answer is 114.

2 + 5 = 7

Now the problem looks like this:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, my teacher mentioned that multiplication comes before addition and subtraction when they are in the same problem. So I have two multiplications here: 4 * 7 and 2 * 3.

So, 4 * 7 = 28.

Now our equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, we still need to multiply before we do adding or subtracting, so we have to multiply the 2 by 3.

2 * 3 = 6.

Now, we just replace the 2 * 3 in the equation with 6, so it becomes: 28 + 12 - 6.

We just do the adding and subtracting from left to right.

So, the answer is 34.","Oh, I remember my teacher mentioning this! We need to follow the order of operations, which means we have to do the calculations inside the parentheses first, then do multiplication and division from left to right, and finally, we do addition and subtraction from left to right.

So, let's break this down:

First, we calculate what's inside the parentheses, which is (2+5):
2 + 5 = 7

Now we replace that in the original problem:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we do the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Replacing these in the problem, we get:
28 + 12 - 6

Now, we just have addition and subtraction left:
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So the final answer is:
The answer is 34.",34,34,34,7,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,34,1,1,1

2 plus 5 is 7.

Then there's this star thingy next to the 4 and the 7, I think that means 4 times 7. I can count by fours: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28. So 4 times 7 is 28.

There's a plus 12 in the problem, so I'll just add 12 to 28. 28 plus 12 is like 28 plus 10 plus 2, which is 38 plus 2, that's 40.

Now there's a minus sign and then 2 times 3. I know 2 times 3 is like 2 plus 2 plus 2, which is 6.

So I take the 40 and need to take away 6. 40 minus 6 is like 40 minus 10 plus 4, which is 30 plus 4, and that's 34.

So, if I just look at each part and do the math that I know how to do, I get:

The answer is 34.","Oh, okay! I'm not sure about some rule for the order thingy, but I can try what I know! I think you need to do the stuff in parentheses first because it’s like telling you, ""Hey, do me first!"" So, I will add 2 plus 5 which is 7.

Then, because there are some multiplication signs, and I think they're pretty important, let's do those next. So 4 times 7 is 28. And then 2 times 3 is 6.

Now, I just have to add and subtract what’s left, right? I will do it in order from left to right, like how I read a book. So I have:

28 (from the 4 times 7) plus 12 is 40. And then I subtract the 6 (from the 2 times 3) from that. So 40 minus 6 is 34.

So, if I did that all right, the answer is 34.","Oh, I'm not really sure how to do this with special rules, but I can try to figure it out step by step!

Then, I think I just go from left to right because that's how I read!

So I'm going to take that 7 and multiply it by 4 because that was next. So, 4 times 7 is 28.

After that, I see a plus, so I'm going to add 12 to 28. That's 40!

Then I keep going and see I have to subtract 2. So I take 40 minus 2 and I get 38.

And lastly, there's another multiply by 3. So I take 38 times 3 which is... hmm, tough one, but 38 added 3 times is 38 + 38 + 38, which is 76 plus 38, and that's 114!

The answer is 19.","Oh, so I think I just have to do what's in the brackets first because that's like a little math problem inside the bigger one. So 2 plus 5 is 7. Then I multiply 4 by 7 because multiplication is like adding something many times. 4 times 7 is 28.

So now I have 28 plus 12 minus, um, oh I have to multiply again right? 2 times 3 is 6. So now it's 28 plus 12 minus 6.

Then I add 28 and 12 together since that's just like counting up more, and that gives me 40. Lastly, I take away 6 from 40 because minus is like giving away some of what you have. 40 minus 6 is 34.

So the answer is 34.","Oh, so I think I just do what's in the brackets first because it's like a little math problem inside the bigger one. So inside the brackets it's like 2 plus 5, which is 7. Then, I have 4 times 7, plus 12, minus 2 times 3.

Then I see a plus and I add 5:
8 + 5 equals 13.

Next, there is another plus, so I add 12:
13 + 12 equals 25.

Then I see a minus sign, so I subtract 2:
25 - 2 equals 23.

Then there's that multiplication again, so I do 3 times 2:
3 * 2 equals 6.

And then I end with another subtraction because it comes last in the equation:
23 - 6 equals 17.

So, I might think that the answer is 17.

After that, I'll add 12, so 13 + 12 is 25.

Then, I subtract 2, so 25 - 2 gives me 23.

Then I just have to do 4 times the 7 from the brackets, 4 times 7 is...28!

Now I just add the stuff left so, it's 28 plus 6, which I think is 34. So yeah, that's my answer!

The answer is 34.","Oh, okay! I think you just do the math from left to right like reading a book, right?

First, there's a 4 next to a parenthesis thing with 2+5 inside. I think you do the thing in the parenthesis first, so 2+5 is 7.

Then, it's 4 times 7 because they are next to each other. That's like 4 groups of 7... and 7+7 is 14; another 7 makes 21, and then another makes 28.

Next is the plus 12. So you add 12 to 28, which I think is 40.

After that, you have to take away 2 times 3. Well, 2 times 3 is 6 because 2+2+2 is 6. 

So we just subtract 6 from 40. If I took away 6 from 10, I would have 4, right? So taking away 6 from 40 leaves 34.

Next, we just add the 12, so now we have 28 plus 12. That gives us 40 because 28 and 12 make 40.

Now we subtract 2 times 3. Well, 2 times 3 is 6, so now we take the 40 we had and subtract 6 from it.

1. 4 times 2 is 8.
2. Add 5, that makes it 13.

Then I'd multiply the numbers because that's what you do with numbers next to each other. 4 times 7 is 28, and then 10 times 3 is 30.

Finally, I add the two answers together! 28 plus 30 is 58.

The answer is 58.","Since I don't know about the order of operations, I might just do the calculations from left to right as I read them, like this:

First I see 4 and a multiplication sign and then there's a parentheses with 2+5. But I'm not sure how to deal with those. Maybe I just add what's inside first because they kind of make a little room for 2 and 5 to be together, like they're having a party and don't want to be bothered. So:

2 + 5 equals 7.

The problem now looks like this:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

I guess I keep going from left to right.

So now I multiply 4 times 7:

4 * 7 equals 28.

28 + 12 equals 40.

40 - 2 * 3

Subtract 2 from 40:

40 - 2 equals 38.

38 * 3 is... oh, uh, I don't know really big numbers multiplication yet, but I can add 38 three times like this:

38 + 38 + 38 - I can do this part! It's like stacking blocks and then counting them all. So that would be... 76 and then 114!

Now, it looks like 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

And then I multiply by 3... 38 * 3... oh, no, that's a big number. Wait, maybe I multiply the 2 and the 3 first? Like when we did the 4 and the 7. So, 2 * 3 is 6.

Then multiply 4 by 7 because 4 is right next to the parentheses, and I think that means I multiply. 4 times 7 is 28.

After that, I add 12 to that number because addition comes next, so 28 plus 12 is 40.

Lastly, I do 2 times 3 which is 6, and then I subtract this from 40 because subtraction comes after adding.

So, 40 minus 6 is 34.

The answer is 34.","Okay, so I'm in elementary school and I'm not sure about special rules for the order, but I can try to solve this by just doing the math from left to right as I see it.

First, I see 4 and there's this star thingy (I think that's times) next to a sort of mini math problem in parentheses, 2+5. I've heard something about parentheses meaning I should do that first, so I’ll add 2 plus 5 and get 7.

Now the problem looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. So I'll just go from left to right. 

4 times 7 is 28. I'll write that down. Now it's 28 + 12 - 2 * 3. 

Next, 28 plus 12 is 40. I'll replace that part of the problem with 40. Now I have 40 - 2 * 3.

I'm supposed to subtract 2 from 40, which is 38. So I've got 38 * 3 now. I guess I should do the multiply next.

38 times 3... I can count by threes or use my fingers, but that's a big number. If I do some quick math, 30 times 3 is 90, and 8 times 3 is 24. If I add those together (90+24), that’s... 114!

The answer is 114.","Oh, I'm not really sure about all the rules, but I'll just try to do stuff step by step from left to right. So first I see 4 times something, and that something is in brackets - (2+5). I'll add 2 and 5 together because brackets seem important. So, 2+5 is 7.

Now I have 4 times 7, which is 28. Then I'll just keep going. I have to add 12, so that's 28 plus 12, which makes 40. Now I subtract 2, and I get 38. And last, I have to multiply by 3, because I saw that multiplication after the minus.

So now it's 38 times 3 which is... umm, I think it's 114 because 30 times 3 is 90 and 8 times 3 is 24, and 90 plus 24 is 114.

So I did everything step by step and got 114!

So first, I'd do the 4 times something because it's the first thing I see. But I see there are things inside brackets (2 + 5), so maybe I should add those up first? 

So let's say 2 plus 5 is 7. Cool. 

Now I multiply that by 4 because of the little star thingy, which I think means times. So 4 times 7 is 28!

Then I'll just keep going to the right. Next is the plus 12, so I add 12 to 28, which makes it 40.

And then it says minus 2 times 3. I think times is stronger than minusing so I do 2 times 3 first, which is 6.

So now I take my 40, and I subtract the 6, which gives me 34.

So I think the answer is 34. 

The answer is 34.","Well, I'm just going to do the math the best way I think. So first I see 4 and 2+5, I think 4 times 2 is 8 and plus 5 is 13. Then I have to add 12 to it, so 13 plus 12 is 25. And then subtract, 2 times 3 is 6, so subtract that from 25. My final answer is 25 minus 6, which is 19.

Now I have 4 times 7, which is 28.

Then I add 12, so it's 28 plus 12, which gives 40.

And then I subtract 2 times 3. Again, I multiply 2 by 3, which is 6.

Then you just keep going to the right, so add 12 to 28 and that’s 40. 

After that, you go further to subtract 2 times 3. Since 2 times 3 is 6, you then take 6 away from 40, and that's 34.

Next, I remember my teacher saying that we should do the multiplication before the addition and subtraction. So I'll multiply 4 times 7, and then 2 times 3.

4 times 7 is 28, and 2 times 3 is 6.

28 + 12 - 6

Then it looks like I have 4 times that 7, plus 12, and then minus 2 times 3.

So I'd do the 4 times 7 next because that's what comes after. So that's 28.

Then I have 28 plus 12, which is 40.

And the last part is 2 times 3, which is 6.

So lastly, I take away that 6 from my 40, which leaves me with 34.

Now the equation looks like 28 plus 12 minus 2 times 3. I like adding before I do anything else, so I'd add 28 and 12 to get 40. And then I know that 2 times 3 is 6.

So now it looks like 40 minus 6. If I take away 6 from 40, I have 34 left.

We have 2 plus 5 inside the brackets, so if I add those together, it's like adding two toys plus five toys, which gives us seven toys. So that bit turns into:

4 * 7

Then, there's this plus 12 and minus 2 times 3 left. Hmm, I've seen my older brother do this; we should do the multiplication before the adding and subtracting, cause I heard that's kinda like a rule.

So, I multiply 4 times 7, which is like having 4 groups of 7 things. When I count them all, I get 28. Then, I multiply the 2 times 3 because that's also multiplication, and that gives me 6.

Now it looks like this:

28 + 12 - 6

Adding 28 and 12 is like if I had 28 candies and I got 12 more, that's a lot of candies... Oh right! So I count them up and get 40 candies. Then if I had to give back 6 candies, I would take the 6 away from 40, which leaves me with:

The answer is 34.","So, we're going to solve this step by step together! We need to remember to do the things in parentheses first, that's like the first rule I learned.

Inside the parentheses we have 2 + 5. So let's add those together first. 2 plus 5 equals 7. Now we can rewrite the problem replacing the (2+5) with 7. So it looks like this now:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I think we need to do the multiplication parts before we do addition or subtraction. So let's multiply 4 times 7. That gives us 28. And 2 times 3 is 6, right? So now our problem looks like this:

28 + 12 - 6

Now we just add and subtract from left to right. So first we add 28 and 12. That gives us 40. Okay, now we take that 40 and subtract 6.

40 - 6 equals 34.

So after doing all those steps, the final answer should be:

First, we do what's inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

Then, we multiply:
4 * 7 = 28

Next, we do the multiplication again with the 2 and the 3:
2 * 3 = 6

Now, we add and subtract everything:
28 (from the 4 * 7) + 12 - 6 (from the 2 * 3)

First add 28 and 12:
28 + 12 = 40

And then subtract 6:
40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","Okay, so I'm not quite sure about the fancy rules, but I think you do stuff in the parentheses first because it's like doing the inside of a present before you wrap it up. So in the parentheses, 2 plus 5 is 7. Then you've got 4 times that, and 4 times 7 is 28! 

Next, we have the plus 12 part, and since I'm really good at adding, that's easy: 28 plus 12 is 40. 

Now, there's this minus thingy and some more multiplying. Minus is like taking away, so we'll do that after, because the multiplication is like making more of something and you probably do that before you start taking it away. So, 2 times 3 is 6.

Last, we take that 40 we had and take away the 6, which means we end up with 34 because 40 minus 6 is 34.

So, the answer is 34.","Okay, let's figure it out step by step:

First, we do the stuff in the parentheses, which is the adding part:
2 + 5 = 7

Now we replace that part in the expression:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

After that, we do the multiplication parts, because multiplying is like doing lots of adding quickly, so 4 times 7 is:
4 * 7 = 28

And 2 times 3 is:
2 * 3 = 6

So now we replace the multiplication parts in the expression:
28 + 12 - 6

And the last step is to do the adding and then the subtracting:
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So, that means the whole thing equals:

Then, I need to do the multiplication parts before the addition and subtraction because that's another rule. So I take that 7 and multiply it by 4, which is 28.

Now I do the other multiplication, which is 2 times 3, and that equals 6.

So what I have now is 28 plus 12 minus 6.

Then, my teacher said to solve it from left to right like reading a book, doing addition and subtraction. So 28 plus 12 is 40, and then I take away 6 from 40, which is 34.

The answer is 34.","Since I'm in elementary school and I don't know about order of operations, I might just do the math from left to right like I would read a sentence. So I would first do 4 times 2 which is 8, then add 5 to get 13. After that, I would multiply that by 4 to get 52. Then I would add 12 to make 64, subtract 2 to get 62, and finally multiply by 3 to get 186. But my teacher told me that's not quite right because there are special rules for which order to do the math in. 

The answer is... actually, I think I need to learn about the order of operations to figure it out for real!","Okay, so let's think about this step-by-step! My teacher says we have to do things in a special order when we see problems with lots of different math stuff in them. First, we have to do what's inside the parentheses. So let's do that first!

Inside the parentheses we have:
2 + 5

That equals 7 because 2 plus 5 is 7.

Now the problem looks like this:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, my teacher says we do any multiplication or division before we do addition or subtraction. So we need to do the multiplication parts next.

First we'll multiply 4 and 7:
4 * 7 = 28

And then we'll multiply 2 and 3:
2 * 3 = 6

So now the problem looks like this:
28 + 12 - 6

Now we just have addition and subtraction left, and we do that from left to right.

First we add 28 and 12:
28 + 12 = 40

So now we have 4 times 7 because we did the 2 + 5 first, which is 28. Now we write down the rest of the problem with 28 instead of the 4*(2 + 5) part: 28 + 12 - 2*3. We still gotta do multiplication before adding, so let's do the 2*3 part. That's 6.

Now we replace the 2*3 with 6, and the equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6. Now we just do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So 28 plus 12 is 40, and then 40 minus 6 is 34.

The answer is 34.","Well, I know that in math problems, you usually have to do things in a special order. I think my teacher told me we have to do the stuff in parentheses first, so I will start with that!

Then, I remember that we have to do multiplication before we do addition or subtraction. I'll multiply those next!

4 * 7 equals 28,

Now the equation is:
28 + 12 - 6

Then, I heard about something like 'multiplication comes before addition and subtraction', so I have to do the times stuff next. 

So, I multiply 4 times 7 which is 28 and 2 times 3 which is 6.

So let's do it step by step:

1. Do what's in the parentheses first: (2+5) which equals 7.
2. Now we do the multiplication and division from left to right:
   - First, multiply 4 times what we got in the parentheses, 4 * 7, which is 28.

   - Then, we subtract the 6 we got from the last multiplication in step 2, which gives us 34.

Now we have 28 plus 12 and then we subtract 2 times 3. I know 2 times 3 is 6 because that's easy to remember.

So let's put it all together now. We have 28 plus 12, which makes 40. Then we take 40 minus 6 because we have to take away that 2 times 3 we did earlier. That leaves us with 34.

The answer is 34.","So, first I think we should add the numbers in the parentheses because it's like they're in a little bubble. So that's 2 + 5 which is 7. Then we have 4 times that bubble, so 4 * 7, that's like 4 plus 4 plus 4 plus 4 plus 4 plus 4 plus 4, which is 28.

Then we also add 12, so 28 plus 12 is 40.

And there's this other part where we multiply 2 times 3, which makes 6.

So we had 40, and then we take away 6 since we subtract at the end. So what's 40 minus 6? That’s like if you have 40 candies and eat 6, you have 34 candies left.

2 + 5 = 7

Then, we have to take care of the multiplication before we add or subtract anything else. So we need to multiply the 4 by the 7 we just found from adding 2 and 5 together.

Now, we need to figure out the part with the subtracting and multiplying at the end, which is 12 - 2*3. But we need to do the multiplying part first, before we do the subtracting, because multiplying comes before subtracting in the order. So we do 2 * 3 first.

After that, we have 28 + 12 - 2 times 3 left. I think we do the multiplication first again, so 2 times 3 is 6.

And then we do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So we go 28 + 12 which is 40, and then we take the 6 away from 40. 40 - 6 is 34. 

Therefore, the final answer should be 34. 

The answer is 34.","Oh, I remember the teacher talked about something called the ""Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally"" rule, which is a funny way to remember the order of operations. It stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So first, I'll do what's in the parentheses (2+5) which is 7.

Then, I will do the multiplications and divisions from left to right. So first is 4 times what I got in the parentheses, so 4*7 is 28.

There is another multiplication part, which is 2*3, and that's 6.

Now I just have to do the addition and subtraction, which is 28 (from the 4*7) plus 12 and then minus 6 (from the 2*3).

So, 28 plus 12 is 40, and then 40 minus 6 is 34.

The answer is 34.","Umm, so my teacher told us that when we do a math problem, we have to do some things before others. She said we have to do what's inside parentheses first. So I'm gonna do that!

First, there are these numbers in the parentheses: (2+5). I add those together because that's what parentheses mean. 2 plus 5 is 7.

Now the problem looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Then, my teacher said we have to do multiplication before we do addition or subtraction. So I need to multiply 4 times 7, which is 28. And then, multiply 2 times 3, which is 6.

So it changes to: 28 + 12 - 6

Now we just do addition and subtraction from left to right. So, I add 28 and 12 first. That's 40. Then I subtract 6 from 40, which is 34.

So inside the parentheses we have 2 + 5, that's like if I have two candies and someone gives me five more, I'd have seven candies. So now that part looks like 4 times 7, because we did the parentheses part.

Next I think we do the multiplication because it seems really important, like when we do groups of things in class. So if I have 4 groups of 7 things, that would be like having 28 things, because 7 plus 7 plus 7 plus 7 is 28. 

Then the rest of the problem has addition and subtraction, and we can do that like normal, left to right. So we'll add 12 to our 28 first, which is like having 28 cupcakes and getting 12 more, which would be the best day. So 28 plus 12 is 40 because 28 plus 2 is 30 and then we add 10 more to get to 40.

Lastly, we have to subtract 2 times 3 from 40. Again, I think we do the multiplication first, so 2 times 3 is like having 2 groups of 3 candies, which is 6 candies. Now we just take that away from our 40. So 40 minus 6, that's like if I had 40 stickers and I gave 6 away, I'd have 34 stickers left. 

So putting it all together, I think the answer is 34.","Oh, I learned this just a little while ago! My teacher said that we need to do the math problems in a special order, like when we follow the rules in class.

First, we have to do what's inside the parentheses. So I'll add 2 + 5. That's 7!
Next, we do the multiplication and division from left to right. My teacher said it's like reading a book!

So first, we'll do 4 times the number we got from the parentheses, which is 7. 4 times 7 is 28.

Now we look at the problem again and it looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2*3.

We still have more multiplying to do! The 2 times 3 part comes next. That's 6.

Now the problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.

Then we do the adding and subtracting from left to right. So first, we add 28 and 12. That makes 40! Lastly, we subtract 6 from 40, and that gives us 34.

The answer is 34.","First, I need to do the stuff in the parentheses because that's like the rule I learned. So I have:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Then I think I have to do the multiplication before addition or subtraction because that's another rule. 

So I multiply 4 times 7, which is 28. And then 2 times 3, which is 6.

Now the problem is:

28 + 12 - 6

Then I just go from left to right. First I add 28 and 12:

28 + 12 is 40.

The rule is called ""Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally"" or something like that, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and then Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So first, I have to look for parentheses and solve what's inside them. I see 2 + 5 in parentheses.

2 + 5 equals 7.

Then, I have to multiply or divide before I add or subtract. So I'll multiply 4 times what I got from inside the parentheses.

4 times 7 equals 28.

Next, I see there's some more multiplication. There's 2 times 3, so I have to solve that.

2 times 3 equals 6.

Now, I'll replace what I've figured out with the numbers and then add and subtract from left to right.

28 + 12 - 6.

Adding 28 and 12 first is what I do next because it comes before subtraction.

28 + 12 equals 40.

Last, I take away 6 from 40 because that's the next thing to do.

40 - 6 equals 34.

The answer is 34.","Okay, let me try to solve this!

First, I know we have to do the stuff in the parentheses. So we do 2 + 5, and that equals 7.

Then, we multiply that by 4 because multiplication comes before adding or subtracting. So 4 times 7 is 28.

After that, we have to add 12 to our result. So, 28 plus 12 equals 40.

Next, we have to do the subtraction and the other multiplication. We have ""- 2 * 3"" at the end, which is like saying ""2 times 3"" first because multiplication is before subtraction. So, 2 times 3 is 6.

Now we take our 40, and subtract 6 because we already did the multiplication. So, 40 minus 6 equals 34.

So the answer is 34.","So first, I know I need to do the part in the parentheses, which is (2+5). So let's add that together:

2 + 5 = 7

Then we have to do the multiplication before we do the addition or subtraction. So let's multiply 4 times 7, and 2 times 3:

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now we replace those in our problem:

28 + 12 - 6

Then we just add and subtract from left to right. So first we add 28 and 12:

Now my problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2 times 3. I remember that I should do times before plus and minus. So I do 2 times 3 which is 6. 

Then all I have left is 28 plus 12 minus 6. I'll add 28 and 12 first because they're next to each other and that makes 40. Finally, I take 40 and subtract 6 and that gives me 34.

The answer is 34.","Okay, so I'm not sure about any rules for doing math problems, so I'll just do this step by step, starting from the left. So first I see 4 times something, and that something is 2+5.

So now the problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2 times 3. 

Next, I add 28 and 12. That's 40.

Now I have 40 minus 2 times 3. I'll do the 2 times 3 next, which is 6.

Last step, I'll take 40 and subtract 6 from it. 40 minus 6 is 34.

The answer is 34.","Okay, so let's work this out! First, we need to do what's inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5. That equals 7. Then, we multiply that number by 4 because it's right outside the parentheses. So 4 times 7 is 28.

Then we have to add 12 to that, so 28 + 12 is 40.

Lastly, we need to subtract the product of 2 and 3 from that total. Multiplying 2 by 3 is 6. So we take our 40 and subtract 6, and that leaves us with 34.

Inside the parentheses is 2 + 5, and if I add those together I get 7.

Now the problem looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I learned that I need to do multiplication before I do addition or subtraction. So I will multiply 4 times 7 which is 28, and I will also multiply 2 times 3 which is 6.

Now my problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

Then, I can do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So, 28 plus 12 is 40.

Lastly, 40 minus 6 is 34.

Now we have 4 times 7, plus 12, minus 2 times 3. My teacher said that multiplication is like repeated adding, so we have to do that next. 4 times 7 is like 7 plus 7 plus 7 plus 7, which is... 28!

So now the problem looks like 28 plus 12, minus 2 times 3. We still have multiplication to do. Two times 3 is like 3 plus 3, which is 6.

Finally, we have 28 plus 12, minus 6. I know that 28 plus 12 is like 28 and then 10 more which is 38, and 2 more makes 40! So now we have 40 minus 6, which is... if you take away 6 from 40, you get 34.

Next, my teacher mentioned that multiplying is like having lots of groups of something, so I will do that next. 4 times 7 is like having 4 groups of 7 cookies, which gives me 28 cookies!

So now my problem is 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Now I have to do another multiplication. The 2 * 3 part is like having 2 packs of stickers, with 3 stickers in each pack, that's 6 stickers!

So what I have to solve now is 28 + 12 - 6.

Adding is like gathering stuff together. So if I have 28 marbles and I get 12 more, I now have 40 marbles.

Finally, subtracting is like giving some away. If I have 40 candies and give 6 away, I'm left with 34 candies.

So 4 times 7 is 28.

Now we have 28 and then we have to add 12 to it, because it comes after that in the problem. So 28 plus 12 is 40. 

Then we have to do the minus 2 times 3 part, which is another multiplication. Multiplying 2 times 3 is like saying 2 plus 2 plus 2, which is 6. So now we have to take away 6 from our 40 because that's what subtraction is, taking away.

So if we have 40 and we take away 6, we are left with 34. And that's our answer.

The answer is 34.","Ok! So I think we should first do the stuff inside the parentheses because it's kind of like when you do your chores first before you get to play.

So, 7 times 4 is 28.

Now we have 28 plus 12 minus and then... oh wait, there's another multiplying part, 2 times 3, which is like having 2 threes or 6. Subtracting is the opposite of adding, so we'll keep that in mind.

Then we just have to put it all together. Take that 28, add 12 to it and that's kind of like having 28 cookies and getting 12 more, which is a total of 40 cookies! Then we have to give away 6 cookies because we are subtracting 6, so we would have 40 minus 6 left which is 34.

So after doing all those steps and giving away and adding cookies, we end up with 34 cookies, I mean, the answer as the total.

Next, we have to add 12 to it, so 28 + 12. That's like having two tens which is 20 and then 8 and 2 which is 10, so 20 + 10 makes 30.

So now we have 28 + 30, which gives us 58.

Then we have to take away 2 times 3, which is like saying 2 three times. That's 6!

So we have 58 and we take away 6, and that's like having 50 and then taking away 5 to make 45, and then taking away one more to make 44.

Now it looks like I have 28 plus 12 minus 2 times 3. My teacher says I should do the times next. So 2 times 3 is like 2 groups of 3 which is 6.

So now I have 28 plus 12, which is 40, and then I subtract the 6 from before.

So it's 40 minus 6. And that's like if I have 40 candies and eat 6, I have 34 left.

First, we do what's inside the parentheses: (2+5). We add 2 and 5 and we get 7.

4 * (2+5) becomes 4 * 7.

Next, there are no exponents, so we do the multiplication part. 

So, we do 4 * 7, which is 28.

Our equation now looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, we do the multiplication again, because we have 2 * 3 left. That's 6.

4 * 3 = 12

Then, I need to add 2 to that total. So I take the 12 from the multiplication and add 2 to it, like 12 + 2, which equals 14.

The answer is 14.","So, I just learned this cool rule that helps us figure out math problems like this. It's called the order of operations, and it helps us know what to do first.

For the problem 4*3+2, here's what I would do:

1. Look for Parentheses; there are none here.
2. Look for Exponents; none here either.
3. Now, do the Multiplication or Division (from left to right). So I'll multiply 4 and 3 first.
4 * 3 = 12

4. Now, do the Addition or Subtraction (from left to right). I just add 12 and 2 together.
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 13.","Oh, I think I remember my teacher talking about something like this. She said that we have to do multiplication and division before we do addition and subtraction. So for this problem, I need to multiply 2 and 4 first before I add the 5.

So, 2 times 4 is 8.

Then, I add the 5 to the 8.

5 + 8 equals 13.

So, the answer is 13.","Hm, I just learned something called the order of operations. It's like a rule about which things to do first in a math problem. My teacher said we should do any parentheses first, then exponents, then multiplication and division from left to right, and lastly, addition and subtraction from left to right. They use the word PEMDAS to remember it. P is for parentheses, E is for exponents, M is for multiplication, D is for division, A is for addition, and S is for subtraction.

In this problem, 5 + 2 * 4, there are no parentheses or exponents, so I should look for multiplication or division first. There is a multiplication: 2 * 4. So I do that part first.

2 * 4 equals 8.

Now the problem is 5 + 8.

5 + 8 equals 13.

However, if I stumbled upon the correct way to do it by chance or if someone told me the rule that multiplication comes before addition, then I'd do the multiplication first. So that would be 2 times 4, which is 8, and then add the 5 to get 13.

So I think the answer is 28.","When we do math problems like this, it's like when you follow steps to make a craft in class. You have to do the steps in the right order for it to come out right.

For this problem, it's like our teacher told us that we have to do the times part (multiplication) before we do the adding part.

So first we multiply 2 times 4, which gives us 8, and then we add that to 5.

5 + 2 * 4
= 5 + (2 * 4)
= 5 + 8
= 13

The answer is 13.","When I look at the math problem 5 + 2 * 4, since I'm in elementary school and I haven't learned about the order of operations yet, I might just try to solve it from left to right, like reading a book! So, here's what I would do:

5 + 2 = 7

7 * 4 = 28

1. Parentheses (anything inside brackets)
2. Exponents (like when you have a number to the power of another number)
3. Multiplication and Division (which come left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (also from left to right)

Since there are no parentheses or exponents here, I only need to focus on multiplication and addition.

Alright, let's do multiplication first:

7 times 2 equals 14.
8 times 5 equals 40.

That means we have to follow a certain order when we're doing math problems, right? Like, we have to do the things inside parentheses first, then exponents, then multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction.

So, let's try to solve the problem again. First, we need to do the things inside parentheses. There's a 2 and a 5 inside parentheses, so we need to add them together. That's 7.

Oh, you said it means ""Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction""? That sounds like a lot to remember!

Okay, let's see... In this problem, there are no parentheses, so we can skip that part. There are no exponents either, so we can move on to the multiplication and division part.

I see that there's a multiplication sign between 4 and 3, so I'll do that first. 4 multiplied by 3 is 12.

Now, there's no division sign, so we can move on to the addition and subtraction part. There's only one addition left, which is 2.

So, if we add 7 and 8 together, we get 15.

The answer is 15.

I hope that's right!","Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that when we do math, we have to follow some rules. Like, we have to do the things that are inside the parentheses first. In this case, we have 2*4 inside the parentheses.

So, let me see... 2 times 4 is equal to 8.

Now, we have 5 plus 8. That's easy! 5 plus 8 is equal to 13.

The answer is 13.","Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that the plus sign means we have to add two numbers together. So, I'll start by adding 5 and 2. That gives me 7.

But wait, there's more! I see a multiplication symbol (it looks like a cross) and some numbers after it. That means I have to multiply 2 numbers together. I'll multiply 2 and 4, and that gives me 8.

Now, I have two numbers: 7 and 8. I'm not sure what to do with them. Do I add them? Do I multiply them? I'm so confused!

Oh, I know! I remember my teacher saying something about following a special order when we do math problems. She called it PEMDAS. Let me see if I can remember what that means...

PEMDAS stands for ""Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction."" That's a lot to remember, but I think I can do it!

So, let's see... there aren't any parentheses or exponents in this problem. That means I can skip to the multiplication and division part. I already multiplied 2 and 4, so that's done. And there's no division in this problem either.

That means I can move on to the addition and subtraction part. I have two numbers: 7 and 8. I can add them together!

7 + 8 = 15

( peinture à l'huile )  Sure, I can explain that too!

In Mathematics, we have something called the ""Order of Operations"" that helps us solve problems. It's like a recipe for solving math problems step by step, so we don't forget anything important.

The Order of Operations says we should do anything inside parentheses first, then do any exponents (like squaring or cubing), then do multiplication and division from left to right, and finally do addition and subtraction from left to right.

So, in the problem 5 + 3*2, we do the multiplication first because it comes before addition in the Order of Operations. We multiply 3 and 2 to get 6, then add 5 to 6 to get 11. That's why the answer is 11!

Okay, so imagine you have five apples and your friend has three apples. If you want to know how many apples you both have altogether, you need to add your apples together. That's the ""+"" sign. It means ""add."" So, 5 + 3 is like asking how many apples you and your friend have altogether.

But wait, there's a catch! Your friend has three apples, but they're not just regular apples. They're magic apples that multiply when you touch them. So, when you touch your friend's three apples, they turn into six apples! That's the ""*"" sign. It means ""multiply."" So, 3 * 2 means your friend has six apples now.

Now, we need to add your apples to your friend's apples. Remember, you have five apples, and your friend has six apples. If you add them together, you get eleven apples! That's the answer: 5 + 3 * 2 = 11.

So, I see a bunch of numbers and symbols here: 7*2+8*5. Let's start by multiplying the numbers together. That's what we do first, right?

7*2 is 14, and 8*5 is 40. Okay, cool. Now, we add them together. That's what the + sign means, right?

14 + 40 = 54.

Okay, so I see that there are a bunch of numbers and symbols in the problem. Let me try to break it down.

First, I see a 7 and a 2. I know that 7 is bigger than 2, so I think I should multiply 7 by 2 to get 14.

Next, I see an 8 and a 5. I know that 8 is bigger than 5, so I think I should multiply 8 by 5 to get 40.

Finally, I see that there's an 8 hiding over there, and it looks like it wants to be multiplied by something. I think I should multiply 8 by 5, because that's what the problem says to do. So, 8*5 = 40.

Now, I have a choice to make. Should I add 40 to 19, or should I add 19 to 40? I'm not sure what the right thing to do is, but I think I'll add 19 to 40, because that seems like the right way to do it. So, 40 + 19 = 59.

So, the problem becomes:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Now I'd do the multiplication because, in my mind, it seems easier to do that before addition and subtraction.

4 * 7 = 28
28 * 3 = 84

So, the problem now looks like:

28 + 12 - 84

Next, I'd do the addition and subtraction from left to right since I believe that's how it should be done.

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 84 = -44

So, finally, the answer should be:

The answer is -44.","As a grade 6 student, I would approach this problem by doing the operations inside the parentheses first, then any exponents, followed by multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction. So, let's follow those steps:

Lastly, I will do the last multiplication: 40 - 2 * 3. I don't know the rule for this one, but I see that I should probably do the multiplication first because of the equals sign between the subtraction and the multiplication. So, 2 * 3 = 6. Then, 40 - 6 = 34.

This way, we do the multiplication (4*3) first, which equals 12. Then we add the 2: 12 + 2 = 14.

Method 2: Add first

Ah, yes! My teacher told us that we should follow the order of operations which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). That's PEMDAS for short.

So if I was given the problem 4*(2+5)+12-2*3, I would start by adding 2 and 5 to get 7. Then I would multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. After that, I would add 12 to get 40. Finally, I would multiply 2 by 3 to get 6 and then subtract that from 40 to get 34.

The answer is 34.

However, I should note that this answer is actually incorrect, because I did not follow the order of operations rule. If I followed the rule, I would have done the multiplication and division before the addition. Doing so would have given me the correct answer, which is 26. It's important to remember to follow the order of operations rule when solving math problems to make sure we get the correct answer.","Okay, so I don't know about this ""order of operations"" thing, but I know how to do math.

So, if I am given the problem 4 * 3 + 2, I would add 2 to 4 * 3, and get 20 + 2 = 22. However, this is incorrect because I didn't follow the order of operations rule.

The correct way to solve this problem is to follow the order of operations, which means multiplying first (4 * 3 = 12), then adding (12 + 2 = 14).

But I remember my teacher telling me that in math, we have to follow some rules to make sure everyone gets the same answer. We should do calculations in a certain order.

The order is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). That's where PEMDAS comes from.

Looking at our question, 5 + 3*2, there are no parentheses or exponents. So we move on to multiplication which is then followed by addition. So we should do the multiplication part first.

3*2 equals 6. 

Now, replace the multiplication part in the original equation with 6. 
So it becomes 5 + 6.

Then, I would add those numbers together. 5 + 6 equals 11.

In this problem, there are no Parentheses, Exponents, or Division. So we just need to follow the order of Multiplication and Addition. According to PEMDAS, we should do the Multiplication before the Addition.

Method 1: Multiply 7 and 2, then add 8 to the result, and finally multiply the sum by 5.
That gives: 14 + 8 = 22, and then 22 * 5 = 110.

Method 2: Multiply 2 and 8, then multiply 7 by the result, and finally add the last product to the first.
That gives: 2 * 8 = 16, and then 7 * 16 = 112.

Both methods give different results! It seems like we need a rule to make sure everyone gets the same answer. For now, I will simply say that I don't know which one is the right answer without a clear rule.

Parentheses are used in mathematics to group together related terms or expressions. They are used to indicate the order in which operations should be performed. For example, the expression ""3 + (5 - 2)"" means that the operation ""5 - 2"" should be performed first, and then the result of that operation should be added to 3.

Parentheses are also used to group together terms that are being multiplied or divided. For example, the expression ""3 * (5 / 2)"" means that the operation ""5 / 2"" should be performed first, and then the result of that operation should be multiplied by 3.

Parentheses are an important part of the order of operations, and they are used to ensure that mathematical expressions are evaluated correctly.","Without knowledge of the order of operations, I would interpret the expression as follows:

The answer is 54.","I know that multiplication is repeated addition. So, I can rewrite the problem as:

7 * 2 + 8 * 5 = (7 + 7) + (8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8)

Then, I can add the numbers together:

(7 + 7) + (8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8) = 14 + 40

Finally, I can add 14 and 40 to get the answer:

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will simply evaluate the expression from left to right.

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40
14 + 40 = 54
