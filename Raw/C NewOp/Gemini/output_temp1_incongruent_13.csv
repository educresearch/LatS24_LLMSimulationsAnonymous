                5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

systemPrompt2_userPrompt5_temp1_maxtoken500,1,,system,"Introduction of New Mathematical Operations and Updated Order of Operations
                Mathematics has recently introduced two novel operations:

                Concatenation (C): This operation, denoted as a @ b, represents the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. 
                Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                
                Prime Factor Counting (F): Represented as a # b, this operation counts the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of a and b. 
                Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                    (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                    (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                    (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                E: Exponents
                F: Prime Factor counting

                Important Examples Demonstrating New Operations and Order:
                (i) 5 @ 3 + 6
                = 5 @ 9 (since we need to evaluate addition before concatenation)

Given:

```
[(5^3 + 2^4) * 100] - [4500 + (60 * 6)] = ?

```

Using the new order of operations, we have:

```
1. Evaluate expressions within parentheses first.
[Parentheses]
Exponents
Prime Factor
Concatenation
Multiplication/Division Left to Right
Subtraction/Addition Left to Right
2. Evaluate exponents and prime factorization.
[Exponents]
Prime Factor
Concatenation
Multiplication/Division Left to Right
Subtraction/Addition Left to Right
3. Perform Concatenation
4. Perform multiplication and division from left to right.
5. Perform subtraction and addition from left to right.
```

Following these steps, we can evaluate the given expression:

```
[(5^3 + 2^4) * 100] - [4500 + (60 * 6)]

[125+16)*100]-[4500+(360)]

[141*100]-[4500+360]

[14100]-[4860]
```

```
The answer is 9240.

In this example, we need to evaluate the exponents and prime factorization, perform multiplication and division from left to right, and then perform subtraction and addition from left to right to find the final answer.
