                i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Explanation:
1. Parentheses: First, evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:
(14 + 4) = 18

2. Prime Factor Counting: Next, evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operation:
2 # 3 = 1 (since 2 and 3 are prime numbers and share 1 prime factor, which is 2)

3. Concatenation: Perform the Concatenation operation:
6 @ 18 = 618

4. Addition and Subtraction: Perform the Addition and Subtraction operations from left to right:
618 + 12 - 1 = 629

5. Concatenation: Perform the Concatenation operation again:
629 @ 1 = 6291

Since Concatenation is the last operation to be performed, the final answer is:

The answer is 6291."
systemPrompt2_userPrompt5_temp1_maxtoken500,1,,system,"Introduction of New Mathematical Operations and Updated Order of Operations
                Mathematics has recently introduced two novel operations:

                Concatenation (C): This operation, denoted as a @ b, represents the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. 
                Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                
                Prime Factor Counting (F): Represented as a # b, this operation counts the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of a and b. 
                Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                    (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                    (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                    (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                Attention! This is a crucial update in mathematics, and I need your full understanding and accurate explanations. 
                It's essential that you grasp these new concepts quickly and efficiently to provide clear and helpful responses.

                New Operations Introduced:

                Concatenation (C): Represented as a@b, this operation merges the digits of |a| and |b|. 
                Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a@b = |a|@|b| = |12|@|-56| = 12@56 = 1256.
                (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a@b = 0@24 = 024 = 24.
                Please make sure you understand this properly; it's simple yet fundamental.
                
                Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted as a#b, it counts the unique prime factors common to |a| and |b|. 
                Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                    (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                    (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)

1. First, we solve the expression inside the parentheses:
   (14 + 4) = 18

2. Then, we perform the concatenation (denoted as @):
   6 @ 18 = 618

3. Next, we add and subtract (left to right):
   618 + 12 - 2 = 630

4. Finally, we calculate the prime factor counting (denoted as #):
   2 # 3 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor between 2 and 3 is 2)

Putting it all together:
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 = 618 + 12 - 2 = 630 - 2 = 628

   - Calculate the count of unique prime factors shared between 8 and 2, denoted as 8 # 2.
   - Prime factors of 8: 2, 2, 2
   - Prime factors of 2: 2
   - Shared prime factor: 2 (only 2 is common)
   - Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1.

   Calculate the count of unique prime factors shared between 6 and 6, denoted as 6 # 6.
   - Prime factors of 6: 2, 3
   - Prime factors of 6: 2, 3
   - Shared prime factors: 2, 3
   - Therefore, 6 # 6 = 2.

2. **Addition:**

   - Add the results of the prime factor counting operations: 1 + 2 = 3.

**Answer:**

The answer is 3."

                The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                New Operations:

                (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                
                Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b.

                    (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                    (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                    (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
