1,4 # 3 + 2,"**Problem:** 4 # 3 + 2

**Solution:**
1. Prime Factor Counting:
   - 4 # 3 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor between 4 and 3 is 2)

2. Addition:
   - 1 + 2 = 3

**The answer is 3.**","Given: 4 # 3 + 2

Explanation:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
   - Calculate the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 4 and 3.
   - Prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
   - Prime factors of 3 are 3.
   - There is no shared prime factor between 4 and 3.
   - Therefore, 4 # 3 = 0.

2. Addition (+):
   - Add the result of prime factor counting and 2.
   - 0 + 2 = 2.

The answer is 2.

Final Answer: 2","1. **Prime Factor Counting (F):**

   - 4 # 3 means counting the unique prime factors common to 4 and 3.
   - Prime factors of 4 are 2
   - Prime factors of 3 are 3
   - There are no common prime factors between 4 and 3.

   Therefore, 4 # 3 = 0

2. **Addition (+):**

   - Now we perform the addition operation.
   - 0 + 2 = 2

**Final Answer:**

The answer is 2.","Given expression: 4 # 3 + 2

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
4 # 3 means counting the number of shared unique prime factors between the absolute values of 4 and 3.
|4| = 4, prime factors: 2, 2
|3| = 3, prime factor: 3
There is only 1 shared unique prime factor (2). So, 4 # 3 = 1.

Step 2: Addition (+)
1 + 2 = 3
