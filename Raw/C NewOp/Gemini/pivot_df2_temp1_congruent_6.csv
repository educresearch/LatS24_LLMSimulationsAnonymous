The answer is 3.","Given: 4 # 3 + 2

Explanation:
1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
   - Find the unique prime factors common to 4 and 3.
   - Prime factors of 4: 2, 2
   - Prime factors of 3: 3
   - There are no common prime factors. Therefore, 4 # 3 = 0.

2. Addition (+):
   - Perform the remaining addition operation.
   - 0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2.","Following the order of PEFMDASC:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
   - Calculate the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 4 and 3.
   - Prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, while prime factors of 3 are 3.
   - There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so 4 # 3 = 0.

2. Addition (+):
   - Perform the addition of 0 and 2.
   - 0 + 2 = 2.

The answer is 6.","Given:

5 + 3#2

Explanation:

According to the new order of operations, PEFMDASC, we first evaluate the prime factor counting operation #.

3#2 is the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 3 and 2. Since the absolute value of 3 is 3 and the absolute value of 2 is 2, and the only prime factor shared by 3 and 2 is 2, 3#2 = 1.

Now we have:

5 + 1

Next, we perform the addition operation.

5 + 1 = 6

Answer:

The answer is 6.","1. First, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation 3#2.
3#2 means counting the unique prime factors common to |3| and |2|. |3| and |2| have no common prime factors, so 3#2 = 0.
