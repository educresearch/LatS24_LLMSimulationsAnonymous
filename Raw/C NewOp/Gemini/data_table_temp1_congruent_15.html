Here's a breakdown of what the program does:<br><br>1. <pre style='font-family: monospace;'># This is a comment in Python.</pre> This is a single-line comment in Python. Anything after the `#` symbol and until the end of the line is ignored by the Python interpreter. Comments are used to provide additional information or explanations about the code.<br><br>2. `print("Hello, world!")` This is a Python statement that uses the `print()` function to print the message "Hello, world!" to the console. The `print()` function takes any number of arguments and prints them to the console, separated by a space by default. In this case, the `print()` function takes a single argument, which is the string "Hello, world!".<br><br>3. When you run this Python program, you should see the message "Hello, world!" printed to the console.<br><br>The answer to your prompt is:<br><br><pre style='font-family: monospace;'><br>The answer is "Hello, world!".<br></pre></td>
