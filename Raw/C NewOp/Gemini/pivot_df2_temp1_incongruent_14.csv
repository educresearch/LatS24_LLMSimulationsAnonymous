1,4#3 + 2,"**Problem:**

4#3 + 2

**Solution:**

1. Prime factor counting operation (#) has higher precedence than addition (+). So, we first evaluate 4#3.

2. Prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. There is no shared prime factor between 4 and 3. So, 4#3 = 0.

3. Now, we can evaluate the expression as 0 + 2 = 2.

**Answer:**

The answer is 2.","Given: 4#3 + 2

Explanation:

1. Prime Factor Counting:
   - 4#3 means counting the number of unique prime factors shared by 4 and 3.
   - Prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, while prime factors of 3 are 3.
   - There is no shared prime factor between 4 and 3, so 4#3 = 0.

2. Addition:
   - We can now perform the addition operation: 0 + 2.

The answer is 2.

Final Answer: The answer is 2.","Given: 4#3 + 2

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting
4#3 = 1 (prime factors of 4 are 2, 2; prime factors of 3 are 3; the only shared prime factor is 2, so 4#3 = 1)

Step 2: Addition
1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3.

Final Answer: The answer is 3.","1. Starting with the expression: 4#3 + 2

2. According to the PEFMDASC order, we first evaluate Prime Factorization. Prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and prime factors of 3 are 3. The count of shared unique prime factors is 1.

3. So, 4#3 = 1

4. Now we can simplify the expression to: 1 + 2

5. Evaluating Addition (left to right): 1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3."
1,5 + 2@4,"Given: 5 + 2@4

Using the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. There are no parentheses, exponents, or prime factor counting operations, so we move to the next operation.
2. Multiplication and division are not present, so we move to the next operation.
3. Addition and subtraction are present. We perform addition first, from left to right.
4. Concatenation is the last operation.

So, 5 + 2@4 = 5 + 24 = 29

The answer is 29.","Using the order of operations PEFMDASC, we have:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F) and Concatenation (@) have no operations to be performed.

2. Addition (+) is performed from left to right: 

5 + 2@4 = 5 + 24 = 29

The answer is 29.

The answer is 29.","1. First, we evaluate the concatenation operation.
2@4 = 24

2. Then, we perform the addition operation.

1,5+3 # 2,"1. Following the order of operations, we first evaluate the prime factor counting operation.

2. Prime factors of 5 are 5 and of 3 are 3. There is no shared prime factor between 5 and 3, so 5 # 2 = 0.

3. Then, we perform the addition operation.

5 + 0 = 5

The answer is 5.

**Answer: 5**","**Problem:** 5 + 3 # 2

**Explanation:**

1. **Prime Factor Counting:** First, we apply the prime factor counting operation (#) to 3 and 2.
   - 3 # 2 = 1 (Since 2 is a prime factor of both 3 and 2.)

2. **Addition:** Next, we perform the addition operation (+).

1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"1. First, we evaluate the operations inside the parentheses:
14+4 = 18

2. Next, we perform the concatenation operation:
6 @ 18 = 618

3. Then, we perform the addition operation:
618 + 12 = 630

4. Next, we perform the prime factor counting operation:
2#3 = 0 (since 2 and 3 have no shared prime factors)

5. Finally, we perform the subtraction operation:
630 - 0 = 630

Therefore, the answer is 630.
The answer is 630.","Given: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first:
   14 + 4 = 18

2. Concatenate 6 with the result of step 1:
   6 @ 18 = 618

3. Add 12 to the result of step 2:
   618 + 12 = 630

4. Count the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 630 and 3:
   630 = 2 x 3 x 3 x 5 x 7
   3 = 3
   2#3 = 1 (since 3 is the only shared prime factor)

5. Subtract the result of step 4 from the result of step 3:
