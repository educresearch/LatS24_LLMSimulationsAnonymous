1,5+3 # 2,"**Problem:** 5 + 3 # 2

**Explanation:**
1. First, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation:
   - 5 has the prime factors 5.
   - 3 has the prime factors 3.
   - 2 has the prime factors 2.
   - 5 # 2 = 0, because 5 and 2 share no common prime factors.

2. Then, we perform the addition operation:
   - 5 + 0 = 5.

**Answer:** 5","Given:

5 + 3 # 2

Using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. Prime Factor Counting (#) has higher precedence than Addition (+). So, we evaluate 3 # 2 first.

3 # 2 = 1 (since 2 and 3 are prime numbers and they share only 1 unique prime factor, which is 2)

2. Now, the expression becomes:

5 + 1
