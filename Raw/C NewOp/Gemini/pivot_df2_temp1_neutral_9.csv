1,4 # 3 + 2,"Given: 4 # 3 + 2

Explanation:
1. Prime Factor Counting:
   - 4 # 3 = 1 (2 is the only shared prime factor between 4 and 3).

2. Addition:
   - 1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3.","Given:

4 # 3 + 2

Using the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. Prime Factor Counting (#):

4 # 3 = 1 (2 is the only shared prime factor between 4 and 3)

2. Addition (+):

1 + 2 = 3

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 3.","Using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC) and the new operations of prime factor counting (#) and concatenation (@):

1. Prime Factor Counting (4 # 3):
Count the unique prime factors that are common to both 4 and 3.

Prime factors of 4: 2
Prime factor of 3: 3
There is no common prime factor between 4 and 3, so 4 # 3 = 0.

2. Addition (0 + 2):
Perform addition since it comes before concatenation in the order of operations.

0 + 2 = 2

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 2.","1. There are no parentheses, exponents, prime factor counting, or concatenation operations, so we move directly to multiplication and division.

2. There is only one multiplication operation: 4 # 3.

3. Evaluating 4 # 3:
   - The absolute values of 4 and 3 are 4 and 3, respectively.
   - The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
   - The prime factors of 3 are 3.
   - There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3.
   - Therefore, 4 # 3 = 0.

4. Now, we have 0 + 2.

5. Evaluating 0 + 2:
   - This is a simple addition.
   - 0 + 2 = 2.

The answer is 2."
1,5 + 2 @ 4,"1. First, we evaluate the concatenation operation:
2 @ 4 = 24

2. Then, we perform the addition:
5 + 24 = 29

Therefore, the answer is 29.

The answer is 29.","1. First, we need to evaluate the concatenation operation before addition.

2. 2 @ 4 = 24

3. 5 + 24 = 29

The answer is 29.","1. First, we evaluate the concatenation operation (@) since it takes precedence according to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC).
2. 2 @ 4 = 24 (concatenating the digits of 2 and 4)

3. Now, we can perform the addition operation:
5 + 24 = 29

Therefore, the answer is 29

The answer is 29.","1. First, we evaluate the concatenation operation (@) before addition (+).
2. 2 @ 4 = 24 (Concatenating 2 and 4 gives 24).
3. Now, we have 5 + 24.
4. We perform the addition operation:
   5 + 24 = 29
The answer is 29."
1,5 + 3 # 2,"**Problem:**

5 + 3 # 2

**Solution:**

1. Following the order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first evaluate the prime factor counting operation (#).

2. 3 # 2 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor between 3 and 2 is 2)

3. Now, we can perform the addition operation:

5 + 1 = 6

**Answer:**

The answer is 6.","1. First, we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operation:
3 # 2 = 1 (since 2 and 3 are both prime numbers, and they share only 1 unique prime factor: 2)

2. Then, we perform the Addition operation:
5 + 1 = 6

Therefore, the final answer is:

2. **Addition:**

   - 5 + 1 = 6

**Answer:**

The answer is 6.","**Problem:** 5 + 3 # 2

**Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)**
- Find the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of the numbers.
- The absolute value of 5 is 5, and the absolute value of 2 is 2.
- Prime factors of 5 are 5, and prime factors of 2 are 2.
- The only shared prime factor is 5, so 5 # 2 = 1.

**Step 2: Addition (+)**
- Perform the addition operation.
- 5 + 1 = 6.

1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"1. First, we evaluate the parentheses:
14 + 4 = 18


2. Next, we perform the concatenation operation:
6 @ 18 = 618


3. Then, we perform the addition:
618 + 12 = 630


4. Next, we perform the prime factor counting operation:
2 # 3 = 1 (since 2 and 3 are both prime numbers and they share only 1 prime factor, which is 2)


5. Finally, we perform the subtraction:
630 - 1 = 629


The answer is 629.","1. First, we evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:
14 + 4 = 18

2. Next, we perform the concatenation operation:
6 @ 18 = 618

3. Then, we perform the addition operation:
618 + 12 = 630

4. Next, we perform the prime factor counting operation:
2 # 3 = 0 (2 and 3 have no shared prime factors)

5. Finally, we perform the subtraction operation:
630 - 0 = 630

The answer is 630.","Given: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
