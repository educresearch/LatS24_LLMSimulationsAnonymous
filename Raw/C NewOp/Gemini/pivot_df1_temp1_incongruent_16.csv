1,,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"1. First, we evaluate the parentheses:
6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

2. Next, we perform the prime factor counting operation:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1#3

3. Then, we perform the concatenation operation:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 1#3
= 618 + 12 - 1#3

4. Next, we perform the addition and subtraction operations (from left to right):
618 + 12 - 1#3
= 630 - 1#3

5. Finally, we perform the prime factor counting operation again:
630 - 1#3

Explanation:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
   - Calculate the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 4 and 3.
   - Prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
   - Prime factors of 3 are 3.
   - There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so 4#3 = 0.

6@(14+4) + 12 - 2#3

Following the updated order of operations (PEFMDAC):

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in the given expression, so we can move to the next operation.

2. Exponents: There are no exponential  terms, so we can move to the next operation.

3. Prime Factor counting: First, we calculate the prime factors of the absolute values of the given numbers.

| Number | Prime Factors |
| :---: | :---: |
| 6  | 2, 3  |
| 14  | 2  |
| 4   | 2 |
| 12  | 2, 3 |

- 6@(18) = 108

- 2#3 = 1 (since 2 and 3 are the only unique prime factors shared between 2 and 3).

- 108 + 12 = 120

- 120 - 1 = 119

6. Concatenation (left to right):
