1,5 + 3 # 2,"**Problem:** 5 + 3 # 2

**Explanation:**
1. Perform the prime factor counting operation:
   - Prime factors of 3 are 3.
   - Prime factors of 2 are 2.
   - There is no shared prime factor between 3 and 2, so 3 # 2 = 0.

2. Perform the addition operation:
   - 5 + 0 = 5.

**Answer:** The answer is 5.","**Problem:** 5 + 3 # 2

**Explanation:**

1. **Prime Factor Counting:**
   - First, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation: 3 # 2 = 1 (because 2 is the only unique prime factor shared by 3 and 2).

2. **Addition:**
   - Next, we perform the addition operation: 5 + 1 = 6.

**Answer:**
The answer is 6.","Given:

5 + 3 # 2

Using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. Prime Factor Counting (#):

3 # 2 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor between 3 and 2 is 2)

2. Addition (+):

5 + 1 = 6

Therefore,

5 + 3 # 2 = 6

The answer is 6.","1. First, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation.

1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"1. First, we evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:
14 + 4 = 18

2. Next, we perform the concatenation operation:
6 @ 18 = 618

3. We then perform the addition operation:
618 + 12 = 630

4. Next, we perform the prime factor counting operation:
2 # 3 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor between 2 and 3 is 2)

5. Finally, we perform the subtraction operation:
630 - 1 = 629

Therefore, the final answer is:
The answer is 629.","Given:
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Explanation:
1. Parentheses: First, evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:
(14 + 4) = 18

2. Prime Factor Counting: Next, evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operation:
2 # 3 = 1 (since 2 and 3 are prime numbers and share 1 prime factor, which is 2)

3. Concatenation: Perform the Concatenation operation:
6 @ 18 = 618

4. Addition and Subtraction: Perform the Addition and Subtraction operations from left to right:
618 + 12 - 1 = 629

5. Concatenation: Perform the Concatenation operation again:
629 @ 1 = 6291

Since Concatenation is the last operation to be performed, the final answer is:

The answer is 6291.","Given: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

1. First, we solve the expression inside the parentheses:
   (14 + 4) = 18

2. Then, we perform the concatenation (denoted as @):
   6 @ 18 = 618

3. Next, we add and subtract (left to right):
   618 + 12 - 2 = 630

4. Finally, we calculate the prime factor counting (denoted as #):
   2 # 3 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor between 2 and 3 is 2)

Putting it all together:
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 = 618 + 12 - 2 = 630 - 2 = 628

The answer is 628.

Formatted answer:
The answer is 628.","Applying the order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. **Concatenation (@):**
   - This operation takes precedence. We evaluate it first, working left to right.
   - 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
   - Calculate 14 + 4 inside the parentheses first: 14 + 4 = 18.
   - Then concatenate result with 6: 6 @ 18 = 618.

2. **Addition (+):**
   - Next, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right.
   - 618 + 12 - 2 # 3
   - 618 + 12 = 630
   - 630 - 2 = 628

3. **Prime Factor Counting (#):**
   - Now, we evaluate prime factor counting.
   - 628 # 3
   - The prime factors of 628 are 2 and 31, while the prime factor of 3 is 3.
   - There is one shared prime factor (3), so 628 # 3 = 1.
