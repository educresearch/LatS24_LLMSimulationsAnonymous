1,,systemPrompt1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"ApplyingExplanation:

1. We start by evaluating the parentheses first:

14 + 4 = 18

2. Now we can perform the concatenation of 6 with 18:

6@18 = 618

3. Next, we evaluate the operations inside the parentheses of the prime factor counting:

3 = 3

4. Now we can count the unique prime factors shared by 3 and 618:

3 # 618 = 3 # (2 * 3^2) = 3 # 3 = 1
