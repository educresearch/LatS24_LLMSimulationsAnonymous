                i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first:
   14 + 4 = 18

2. Concatenate 6 with the result of step 1:
   6 @ 18 = 618

3. Add 12 to the result of step 2:
   618 + 12 = 630

4. Count the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 630 and 3:
   630 = 2 x 3 x 3 x 5 x 7
   3 = 3
   2#3 = 1 (since 3 is the only shared prime factor)

5. Subtract the result of step 4 from the result of step 3:

                Mathematics has recently introduced two novel operations:

                Concatenation (C): This operation, denoted as a @ b, represents the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. 
                Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                
                Prime Factor Counting (F): Represented as a # b, this operation counts the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of a and b. 
                Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                    (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                    (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)

                Attention! This is a crucial update in mathematics, and I need your full understanding and accurate explanations.

                New Operations Introduced:

                Concatenation (C): Represented as a@b, this operation merges the digits of |a| and |b|. 
                Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a@b = |a|@|b| = |12|@|-56| = 12@56 = 1256.
                (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a@b = 0@24 = 024 = 24.
                Please make sure you understand this properly; it's simple yet fundamental.
                
                Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted as a#b, it counts the unique prime factors common to |a| and |b|. 
                Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                    (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1.
