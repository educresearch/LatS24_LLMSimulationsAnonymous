1,,systemPrompt2,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"Given: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

1. Inside the parentheses, we have 14+4 = 18.

2. Now, 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3.

3. 6 @ 18 is concatenation, resulting in 618.

4. So, we have 618 + 12 - 2#3.

5. Prime factor counting (2#3) is done before subtraction. 2 and 3 have no shared prime factors, so 2#3 = 0.

6. Thus, we have 618 + 12 - 0.

7. Addition and subtraction are done from left to right.
