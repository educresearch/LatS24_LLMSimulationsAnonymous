Locate the prime factor counting operation, which is denoted by the # symbol. We have 2 # 3.
- Find the absolute values of 2 and 3, which are 2 and 3.
- Prime factorize 2 and 3: 2 = 2 and 3 = 3.
- Count the number of shared prime factors: There is only one shared prime factor, which is 2.
Therefore, 2 # 3 = 1.
