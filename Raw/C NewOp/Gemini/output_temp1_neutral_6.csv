                Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                1. (P) Parentheses
                2. (E) Exponents
                3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                (i) 5 @ 3 + 6
                = 5 @ 9 (since we need to evaluate addition before concatenation)

**Explanation:**

1. **Prime Factor Counting (#):** First, we calculate the prime factor count of 3 and 2.

   - Prime factors of 3: 3
   - Prime factors of 2: 2

   - Shared prime factor count: 1 (since both 3 and 2 have the prime factor 2)

2. **Addition (+):** Then, we perform the addition operation.

   - 5 + 1 = 6

**Answer:**

The answer is 6."

6 @ 18 = 618

3. Next, perform the subtraction:
618 + 12 - 2 = 630

4. Finally, perform the prime factor counting:
2 # 3 = 1 (since the prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3, there is only 1 shared prime factor, which is 2)

The answer is 631."

                Mathematics has recently introduced two novel operations:

                Concatenation (C): This operation, denoted as a @ b, represents the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. 
                Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                
                Prime Factor Counting (F): Represented as a # b, this operation counts the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of a and b. 
                Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                    (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                    (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                    (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

Explanation:
1. First, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation:
3 # 2 = 1 (since the prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2, there is only one shared prime factor, which is 2)
