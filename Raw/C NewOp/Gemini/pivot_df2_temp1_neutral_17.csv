The answer is 5.","Given: 5 + 3 # 2

Using the order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Prime Factor Counting:

3 # 2 = 1 (2 and 3 are prime factors of 2 and 3, so there is 1 shared prime factor)

2. Addition:

5 + 1 = 6

The answer is 6.","The answer is -3.

Explanation:

Concatenation is the operation of appending one string to the end of another. So # represents the concatenation operator.

- fa = -3
- f'a = -31

Concatenation of fa and f'a is -3-31 = -34.

However, due to the new operation of primefactor, which counts the unique prime factors common to two numbers, we need to consider the prime factors of -3 and -31.

- Prime factors of -3 are 3 and -1.
- Prime factors of -31 are 31 and -1.

The only shared prime factor is -1, so primefactor(-3#-31) = -1.

Finally, we apply the new operation of sub, which subtracts the second number from the first number.

- (-3#-31)#-1 = -34#-1 = -33.

Therefore, the final answer is -33.","1. **Prime Factor Counting (F):**
   - Calculate the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 3 and 2:

     - Prime factors of 2 are 2
     - Shared prime factor is 2

1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"1. First, we evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:
14 + 4 = 18

2. Next, we concatenate the result with 6:
6 @ 18 = 618

3. Then, we add 12:
618 + 12 = 630

4. After that, we find the number of unique prime factors shared by 630 and 3:
630 = 2 * 3^2 * 5 * 7
3 = 3
630 and 3 share only one unique prime factor, which is 3. So, 630 # 3 = 1

5. Finally, we subtract the result from 630:
630 - 1 = 629
