1 + 2 = 3

**The answer is 3.**","1. **Prime Factor Counting:**
   - 4#3 means counting the number of unique prime factors shared between 4 and 3.
   - Prime factors of 4 are 2, 2
   - Prime factors of 3 are 3
   - There is no shared prime factor between 4 and 3, so 4#3 = 0.

5 + 3 # 2

**Explanation:**

1. According to the new order of operations, we first evaluate the prime factor counting operation `#`.

2. 3 # 2 is the count of unique prime factors shared by 3 and 2.

3. The prime factors of 3 are 3, and the prime factors of 2 are 2.

4. There is only 1 shared prime factor, which is 2.

5. So, 3 # 2 = 1.

6. Now we can evaluate the addition operation.

   - Prime factors of 2: 2
   - Shared prime factor: 2
   - 3 # 2 = 1 (since there is only 1 shared prime factor)

2. Addition (+):
   - Perform the addition operation between 5 and the result of prime factor counting.

The answer is 6.","**Step:** Prime Factor Counting
**Explanation:** We calculate the number of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of the numbers - in this case | **absolute value of (** * * )** | is ** * ** .

**Prime Factor Counting Calculation:**

**absolute value of (** * * )** | = ** * **
Prime factors of ** * **  are { ** * }
Prime factors of ** * **  are { ** * }
Shared unique prime factors = ** * **

**Step:** Addition
**Explanation:** We add the numbers after evaluating any other operations in the expression - in this case there were no other operations to evaluate prior to addition so we add the numbers directly as the final step - ( ** * ** + ** * ** )

**Addition Calculation:**

 - Next, we concatenate 6 with 18: 6@18 = 618.


2. **Addition (+):**
 - We add the result of the concatenation to 12: 618 + 12 = 630.


3. **Prime Factor Counting (#):**
 - We count the unique prime factors shared by 630 and 3:
 - Prime factors of 630 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.
 - Prime factors of 3 are 3.
 - The only shared prime factor is 3, so 630#3 = 1.
