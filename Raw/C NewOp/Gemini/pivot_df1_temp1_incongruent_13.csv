1,,systemPrompt2,5+3 # 2,"Here is an example of how to use the updated order of operations to solve a given mathematical problem:

Given:

```
[(5^3 + 2^4) * 100] - [4500 + (60 * 6)] = ?

```

Using the new order of operations, we have:

```
1. Evaluate expressions within parentheses first.
[Parentheses]
Exponents
Prime Factor
Concatenation
Multiplication/Division Left to Right
Subtraction/Addition Left to Right
2. Evaluate exponents and prime factorization.
[Exponents]
Prime Factor
Concatenation
Multiplication/Division Left to Right
Subtraction/Addition Left to Right
3. Perform Concatenation
4. Perform multiplication and division from left to right.
5. Perform subtraction and addition from left to right.
```

Following these steps, we can evaluate the given expression:

```
[(5^3 + 2^4) * 100] - [4500 + (60 * 6)]

[125+16)*100]-[4500+(360)]

[141*100]-[4500+360]

[14100]-[4860]
```
