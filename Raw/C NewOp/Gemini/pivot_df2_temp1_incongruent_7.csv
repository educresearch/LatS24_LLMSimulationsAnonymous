1,4#3 + 2,"**Problem:** 4#3 + 2

**Solution:**
1. Prime Factor Counting:
- 4#3 = 1 (2 is the only shared prime factor between 4 and 3).


2. Addition:
- 1 + 2 = 3

**Answer:**
The answer is 3.","**Problem:** 4#3 + 2

**Explanation:** Using the new order of operations and the definitions of the new operations:

1. Prime Factor Counting: 4#3 = 1 (since the only prime factor shared by 4 and 3 is 2)
2. Addition: 1 + 2 = 3

**Answer:** The answer is 3.","Given: 4#3 + 2

1. Prime Factor Counting:
   - 4#3 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor is 2)

2. Addition:
   - 1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3.","1. First, we perform the operation within the parentheses. Since there are no parentheses, we move to the next step.


2. Next, we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operation (#). The prime factors of 3 are 3, and the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2. The unique prime factor shared by 3 and 4 is 3. So, 4#3 = 1.


3. Moving on, we perform the Addition operation (+). We add 1 and 2.


4#3 + 2 becomes 1 + 2 = 3.


The answer is 3."
1,5 + 2@4,"1. First, we need to evaluate the concatenation operation 2@4, which is simply joining the digits of 2 and 4, resulting in 24.
2. Then, we perform the addition operation between 5 and 24, which is 5 + 24 = 29.

The answer is 29.","**Given:**

5 + 2@4

**Solution:**

1. Perform the concatenation operation first, from left to right:

   2@4 = 24

2. Then perform the addition operation:

   5 + 24 = 29

**Answer:**

The answer is 29.","1. First, we evaluate concatenation:

2@4 = 24

2. Then, we perform addition:

5 + 24 = 29

The answer is 29.","1. **Perform the concatenation operation:**
   - 2@4 = 24 (Join the digits of 2 and 4 together)

2. **Perform the addition operation:**

1,5+3 # 2,"**Problem:**

5 + 3 # 2

**Solution:**

1. Prime factor counting operation has higher precedence than addition, so we evaluate 3 # 2 first.
2. Prime factors of 3 are 3 and prime factors of 2 are 2. There is only one shared prime factor, which is 2. Therefore, 3 # 2 = 1.

3. Now we can perform the addition operation: 5 + 1 = 6.

**Answer:**

The answer is 6.","Given: 5 + 3 # 2

Using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. Prime Factor Counting (#):
   - 3 # 2 = 1 (Since the prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. They share only one common prime factor: 2.)

2. Addition (+):
   - 5 + 1 = 6

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 6.","Given:

5 + 3 # 2

Using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. Prime Factor Counting (#):

   a. Find the unique prime factors common to 3 and 2.
   b. 3 = 3 (prime)
   c. 2 = 2 (prime)
   d. Common prime factor: None

2. Addition (+):

   a. 5 + 3 = 8

Therefore,

5 + 3 # 2 = 8 # 0

The answer is 0.","1. First, identify the operations that need to be performed in the expression: addition (+) and prime factor counting (#).

2. According to the PEFMDASC order of operations, we start with prime factor counting:

   - 3 # 2 = 1 (since 3 and 2 are both prime numbers, they share only 1 unique prime factor, which is 2).

3. Now, we perform the addition:

   - 5 + 1 = 6

The answer is 6."
1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"1. First, we evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:

14 + 4 = 18

2. Next, we concatenate the result with 6:

6 @ 18 = 618

3. Then, we perform the addition:

618 + 12 = 630

4. Next, we calculate the prime factor count of 3 and 2:

2#3 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor between 2 and 3 is 2)

5. Finally, we subtract the result from 630:

630 - 1 = 629

The answer is 629.","1. First, we evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: (14 + 4) = 18.

2. Next, we perform the concatenation operation: 6 @ 18 = 618.

3. Then, we perform the addition: 618 + 12 = 630.

4. Finally, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation: 2 # 3 = 0 (since 2 and 3 have no shared prime factors).

5. Lastly, we perform the subtraction: 630 - 0 = 630.

Therefore, the final answer is 630.

The answer is 630.","1. **Concatenation (@):**
   - Evaluate the concatenation operations first.
   - 6 @ (14+4) = 6 @ 18 = 618.

2. **Parentheses ():**
   - Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses.
   - 14 + 4 = 18.

3. **Addition (+) and Subtraction (-):**
   - Perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right.
   - 618 + 12 - 2 = 630 - 2.

4. **Prime Factor Counting (#):**
   - Calculate the number of unique prime factors common to |2| and |3|.
   - 2#3 = 1 (Since the only prime factor of 2 is 2, and the only prime factor of 3 is 3, there is only 1 shared prime factor, which is 2).

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - 630 - 2 = 628.

The answer is 628.","Given: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

Step 1: Perform operations inside the parentheses:
14 + 4 = 18

Step 2: Apply concatenation (since it has the highest precedence):
6 @ 18 = 618

Step 3: Perform addition and subtraction (left to right):
618 + 12 - 2#3 = 618 + 12 - 1 (since prime factorization counting is performed before subtraction)

Step 4: Perform prime factorization counting:
2#3 = 1 (since 2 and 3 are the only unique prime factors shared between 2 and 3)

Step 5: Complete the remaining addition and subtraction (left to right):
618 + 12 - 1 = 630
