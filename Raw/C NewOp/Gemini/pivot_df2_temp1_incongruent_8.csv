1,4#3 + 2,"**Problem:** 4#3 + 2

**Solution:**

1. **Prime Factor Counting:**

   * Prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2
   * Prime factors of 3 are 3
   * The only shared prime factor between 4 and 3 is 2

   Therefore, 4#3 = 1 (since there is one shared prime factor).

2. **Addition:**

   * 1 + 2 = 3

**Answer:**

The answer is 3.","**Given:**
4#3 + 2

**Solution:**
1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
   - Prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
   - Prime factors of 3 are 3.
   - There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3.
   - Therefore, 4#3 = 0.

2. Addition (+):
   - 0 + 2 = 2

**The answer is 2.**","1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
   - 4#3 = Count the unique prime factors common to 4 and 3.
   - Prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
   - Prime factors of 3 are 3.
   - There is no common prime factor between 4 and 3.
   - Therefore, 4#3 = 0.

2. Addition (+):
   - 0 + 2 = 2.

The answer is 2.","**Problem:**

4#3 + 2

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Prime Factor Counting:**

Find the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 4 and 3.

4 = 2 * 2
3 = 3

The shared prime factor is 2. So, 4#3 = 1.

**Step 2: Addition:**

Add the result of prime factor counting to 2.

1 + 2 = 3

1,5 + 2@4,"1. First, we evaluate the concatenation operation:
2@4 = 24

2. Then, we perform the addition operation:
5 + 24 = 29

Therefore, the final answer is:
The answer is 29.","We will evaluate the expression 5 + 2@4 using the updated order of operations:

1. Concatenation (@) is performed first:
2@4 = 24

2. Addition (+) is performed next:
5 + 24 = 29

Therefore, the answer is:
The answer is 29.","1. First, we evaluate the concatenation operation 2@4, which results in 24:

2@4 = 24

2. Then, we perform the addition of 5 and 24, resulting in 29:

5 + 24 = 29

The answer is 29.","Applying the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. No parentheses or exponents, so we move to the next operation:

2. Prime factor counting: Not applicable here since we don't have multiplication of terms with variables.

3. Multiplication and Division (left to right): Again, not applicable because there are no multiplication or division operations.

4. Addition and Subtraction (left to right): We perform the addition of 5 and 2@4.

5. Concatenation: Not applicable because there is no concatenation operation indicated by the @ symbol.

The answer is 5 + 2@4 = 5 + 24 = 29.

The answer is 29."
1,5+3 # 2,"**Problem:** 5 + 3 # 2

**Explanation:**
