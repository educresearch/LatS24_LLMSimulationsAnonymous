**Explanation:**

1. **Prime Factor Counting:**
   - Calculate the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 3 and 2.
   - Unique prime factors of 3: 3
   - Unique prime factors of 2: 2
   - Shared prime factor: None
   - Therefore, 3 # 2 = 0.

2. **Addition:**
   - Perform the addition operation between 5 and 0 (result of prime factor counting).

The answer is 5.","Given:
5 + 3 # 2

Explanation:
1. According to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we evaluate prime factorization counting (#) before addition (+).
2. Prime factorization counting of 3 and 2 is 1 (i.e., 3 # 2 = 1), since they share only one unique prime factor, which is 3.
3. Now, we have 5 + 1.
4. Simple addition gives us the final answer.

The answer is 6.","1. **Prime Factor Counting (F):**
   - Find the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 5 and 2.
