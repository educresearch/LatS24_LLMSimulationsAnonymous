1,4 # 3+2,"Given: 4 # 3+2

Explanation:
1. According to the new order of operations, we first evaluate the prime factor counting operation #.
2. Prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and prime factors of 3 are 3. The only shared prime factor is 2. Therefore, 4 # 3 = 1.
3. Next, we evaluate the addition operation +.
4 # 3+2 = 1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3.","Given the expression:

```
4 # 3 + 2
```

Using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. **P**: No parentheses, so we move on.

2. **E**: No exponents, so we move on.

3. **F**: Prime Factor Counting
   - Find the unique prime factors of 4 and 3:
     - Prime factors of 4: 2
     - Prime factors of 3: 3
   - Count the number of shared prime factors:
     - Shared prime factor: 0 (since there are no shared prime factors)
   - 4 # 3 = 0

4. **M/D**: Multiplication and Division (left to right)
   - No multiplication or division, so we move on.

5. **A/S**: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
   - Perform the addition:
     - 0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2.

**The answer is 2.**","1. **4 # 3 = 1**. There is only one shared prime factor (2) between 4 and 3.
2. **1 + 2 = 3**. Prime factor counting is done before addition.

The answer is **3**.","Following the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
   - 4 # 3 = 1 (Since the only prime factor shared between 4 and 3 is 2, there is 1 shared prime factor.)

2. Addition (+):
