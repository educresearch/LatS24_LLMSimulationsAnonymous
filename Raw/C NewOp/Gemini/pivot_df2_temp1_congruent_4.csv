1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"Using the newly defined operations and the updated order of operations, here is my solution to the given mathematical problem:

1. Start with the expression: 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3

2. Perform the operations inside the parentheses first (order PEF M D A C from parenthesis to concatenation):
   - 14+4 = 18

3. Concatenate the 6 with the 18:
   - 6@18 = 618

4. Add the 12 to the 618:
   - 618 + 12 = 630

5. Subtract 2 from 630:
   - 630 - 2 = 628

6. Count the unique prime factors shared by 628 and 3:
   - 628 has prime factors 2 and 31
   - 3 has prime factor 3
   - The only shared prime factor is 3
   - 628 # 3 = 1

7. Perform the final concatenation:
   - 628@1 = 6281

Therefore, the answer to the given mathematical problem is 6281.

The answer is 6281.","1. First, we evaluate the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18.
2. Next, we perform the concatenation operation: 6@(18) = 618.
3. Then, we do the addition: 618 + 12 = 630.
4. After that, we perform the subtraction: 630 - 2 = 628.
5. Finally, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation: 628 # 3. The prime factors of 628 are 2, 2, 7, and 23, while the prime factors of 3 are 3. There is only one shared prime factor, which is 2. Therefore, 628 # 3 = 1.

The answer is 1.","1. **Concatenation:**
   - Evaluate the concatenation operation first.
   - 6@(14+4) = 6@18 = 618

2. **Addition:**
   - Perform the addition within the parentheses.

3. **Concatenation:**
   - Perform the concatenation of 6 and the result from step 2.
   - 6@18 = 618

4. **Subtraction:**
   - Subtract 12 from the result of step 3.
   - 618 - 12 = 606

5. **Prime Factor Counting:**
   - Count the unique prime factors common to the absolute values of 606 and 3.
   - Prime factors of 606: 2, 3, 101
   - Prime factors of 3: 3
   - Shared prime factor: 3
