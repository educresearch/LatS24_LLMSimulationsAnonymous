1,4#3 + 2,"4#3 + 2
= 1 + 2 (since 4 and 3 share only 1 unique prime factor, which is 2)
= 3
The answer is 3.","Given: 4#3 + 2

Explanation:
1. First, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation:
   - Prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (2 x 2)
   - Prime factors of 3 are 3
   - The number of unique shared prime factors between 4 and 3 is 1 (2)
   - So, 4#3 = 1

2. Next, we perform the addition operation:
   - 1 + 2 = 3

Hence, the final answer is:
The answer is 3.","Given:
4#3 + 2

Explanation:
1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
4#3 = 1 (Since the only shared prime factor between 4 and 3 is 1)

2. Addition (+):
1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3.","Step 1: Prime Factor Counting

4#3 means counting the number of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 4 and 3.
|4| = 4 and |3| = 3.
Prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
Prime factors of 3 are 3.
There are no shared prime factors.
So, 4#3 = 0.

Step 2: Addition

4#3 + 2 = 0 + 2 = 2.

The answer is 2."
1,5 + 2@4,"Given: 5 + 2@4

1. First, we need to evaluate the concatenation operation 2@4.
2@4 = 24 (concatenating the digits of 2 and 4)

2. Now, we can perform the addition operation:
5 + 24 = 29

The answer is 29.

Therefore, the answer is 29.","1) First, we perform the concatenation operation 2@4, which results in 24.
2) Next, we perform the addition operation 5 + 24, which results in 29.

The answer is 29.","1. First, we evaluate the concatenation operation:

2@4 = 24
