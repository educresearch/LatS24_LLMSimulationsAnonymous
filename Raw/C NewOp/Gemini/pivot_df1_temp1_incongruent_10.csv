1,,systemPrompt2,4#3 + 2,"Given: 4#3 + 2

Explanation:

1. Prime Factor Counting:
   - 4#3 means counting the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 4 and 3.
   - Prime factors of 4: 2, 2
   - Prime factors of 3: 3
   - Shared prime factor: None

2. Adding the result of Prime Factor Counting and 2:
   - 4#3 + 2 = 0 + 2 (since there is no shared prime factor, the result of Prime Factor Counting is 0)
   - 0 + 2 = 2
