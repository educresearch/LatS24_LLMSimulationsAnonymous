1,,systemPrompt1,5 + 2@4,"Using the order of operations PEFMDASC (Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting, Multiplication and Division (Left to Right), Addition and Subtraction (Left to Right), and Concatenation), we evaluate the expression 5 + 2@4 as follows:

1. Prime Factor Counting:
   - 5 and 4 have no shared prime factors, so 5#4 = 0.

2. Concatenation:
   - 2@4 = 24.

3. Addition:

1. First, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation:
   - Prime factors of 4 are 2x2
   - Prime factors of 3 are 3
   - There is no shared prime factor between 4 and 3, so 4#3 = 0.

2. Next, we perform the addition operation:

The answer is 2."
1,,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"1. First, we evaluate the expression inside the parenthesis:
14 + 4 = 18.

2. Next, we perform the concatenation operation:
6 @ 18 = 618.

3. Then, we perform the addition operation:
618 + 12 = 630.

4. Then, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation:
2 # 3 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor between 2 and 3 is 2).

5. Finally, we perform the subtraction operation:
630 - 1 = 629.

Therefore, the answer is 629.

1,,systemPrompt2,4#3 + 2,"1. Prime Factor Counting (F) operation has higher precedence than Addition (+), so we evaluate 4#3 first.
2. Prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and prime factors of 3 are 3. There is only one shared prime factor, 3, so 4#3 = 1.
3. Now we can perform the Addition (+) operation: 1 + 2 = 3.

The answer is 3.

```
4#3 + 2
= 1 + 2
= 3

1,,systemPrompt2,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"1. **Concatenation**:
    - First, we perform the concatenation operation inside the parentheses:
    - 14@4 = 144
2. **Addition**:
    - Next, we perform the addition operation:

3. **Concatenation**:
    - We then concatenate the result with 6:
    - 6@156 = 6156
4. **Subtraction**:
    - We perform the subtraction operation:

5. **Prime Factor Counting**:
    - We calculate the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 2 and 3:
    - 2#3 = 1 (since 2 and 3 share only one unique prime factor, which is 2)
6. **Final Calculation**:
    - 6156 - 1 = 6155

The answer is **6155**."
