1,,systemPrompt3,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"```
The answer is 4.

Explanation:

Concatenation is the process of joining two or more strings together. In this case, the two strings are the digits of the two numbers. For example, the concatenation of the digits of the numbers 1 and 2 is the string ""12.""

The prime factors of a number are the prime numbers that can be multiplied together to produce that number. For example, the prime factors of the number 12 are 2, 2, 2, and 3.

Using the new order of operations, we can first find the prime factors of the two numbers, then concatenate the digits of the numbers, and finally multiply the two numbers together.

The prime factors of 1 are 1 and 1. The prime factors of 2 are 2 and 1. The concatenation of the digits of the numbers 1 and 2 is the string ""12."" Multiplying the two numbers together gives us 2.

Therefore, the answer is 4.
