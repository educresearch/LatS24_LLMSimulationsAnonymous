1,5 + 2 @ 4,"**Given:**

5 + 2 @ 4

**Solution:**

1. Perform the concatenation operation first (since it has the lowest precedence):

5 + 24 = 29

**Answer:**

The answer is 29.","**Problem:** 5 + 2 @ 4

**Explanation:**
1. Prime factor counting and exponentiation are not applicable here.
2. Multiplication and division come before addition and subtraction.
3. Concatenation is performed left to right and comes after addition and subtraction.
4. 2 @ 4 is evaluated first as concatenation, which results in 24.

1,5 + 3 # 2,"**Problem:** 5 + 3 # 2

**Explanation:**
1. Prime Factor Counting:
   - Count the unique prime factors shared by 3 and 2.
   - Prime factors of 3: 3
   - Prime factors of 2: 2
   - Shared prime factor: None

**Solution:**

**Answer:** 5","**Problem:** 5 + 3 # 2

**Solution:**

1. First, evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operation: 3 # 2 = 1 (there is only one unique prime factor shared by 3 and 2, which is 2).

2. Then, perform the Addition operation: 5 + 1 = 6.

The answer is 6.

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 6.","1. First, we find the prime factors of the absolute values of the numbers involved.
   - The prime factors of 5 are 5.
   - The prime factors of 3 are 3.
   - The prime factors of 2 are 2.

2. Next, we count the number of shared prime factors.
   - The only shared prime factor between 5 and 2 is 5. So, 5 # 2 = 1.

3. Finally, we evaluate the expression following the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"1. First, evaluate the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18.
2. Next, perform the concatenation operation: 6 @ 18 = 618.
3. Then, perform the addition: 618 + 12 = 630.
4. Next, evaluate the prime factor counting operation: 2 # 3 = 0 (since 2 and 3 have no shared prime factors).
5. Finally, perform the subtraction: 630 - 0 = 630.

The answer is 630.","1. **Concatenation (@) Evaluation:**
   - We start with the expression inside the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18.
   - Then, we concatenate 6 with 18: 6 @ 18 = 618.

2. **Addition (+) and Subtraction (-) Evaluation (left to right):**
   - Next, we perform the addition: 618 + 12 = 630.
   - Then, we perform the subtraction: 630 - 2 = 628.

3. **Prime Factor Counting (#) Evaluation:**
   - Finally, we calculate the prime factors shared between the absolute values of 628 and 3:
   - Prime factors of 628: 2, 2, 314 = 2^2 * 314
   - Prime factors of 3: 3 = 3^1
