1,4 # 3 + 2,"**Problem:** 4 # 3 + 2

**Solution:**
1. **Prime Factor Counting:**
   - Find the unique prime factors of 4 and 3:
     - Prime factors of 4: 2
     - Prime factors of 3: 3
   - Count the number of shared prime factors:
     - Shared prime factor: None
     - Number of shared prime factors: 0

2. **Addition:**
   - Add the result of prime factor counting and 2:
     - 0 + 2 = 2

**Answer:**
The answer is 2.","1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
4 # 3 = 1 (Since the only shared prime factor between 4 and 3 is 2.)

2. Addition (+):
1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3.

Therefore, the final answer is:
The answer is 3.","The answer is 3.

Here's my detailed solution using the updated order of operations (PEFMD) and the new operations of prime factor counting (#) and concatenation (@).

1. Prime Factor Counting (#):

4 # 3

This means we need to count the unique prime factors that are common to both 4 and 3.

4 has two prime factors: 2 and 2
3 has one prime factor: 3

The only common prime factor is 3.

So, 4 # 3 = 1

2. Addition (+):

1 + 2

This is a simple addition operation.

1 + 2 = 3

3. Concatenation (@):

3 @ 3

This means we need to concatenate (join) the two operands together.

3 @ 3 = 33

Final Answer:

The answer is 33.

The final answer should be in the form of ""The answer is __.""

The answer is 33.","Using the updated PEFMDASC order of operations:

**Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F):**
Calculate the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 4 and 3.
4 = 2 x 2
3 = 3
Shared prime factor: 3
4 # 3 = 1

**Step 2: Addition (+):**
Perform addition.
1 + 2 = 3

**The answer is 3.**"
1,5 + 2 @ 4,"**Problem:** 5 + 2 @ 4

**Solution:**
1. Perform concatenation operation first (from left to right):
    - 2 @ 4 = 24

2. Then perform addition:
    - 5 + 24 = 29

**Answer:** The answer is 29.","1. First, we evaluate the concatenation operation:
2 @ 4 = 24.
2. Then, we perform the addition:
5 + 24 = 29.

The answer is 29.","1. First, we evaluate the concatenation operation:

2 @ 4 = 24

2. Then, we perform the addition:

5 + 24 = 29

The answer is 29.","Applying the order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. **Concatenation (@):** There is no concatenation operation in this expression, so we move to the next operation.
2. **Exponents (^) and Prime Factor Counting (#):** No exponents or prime factor counting operations are present, so we proceed further.
3. **Multiplication and Division (M/D):** Again, no multiplication or division operations are present, so we move along.
4. **Addition and Subtraction (A/S):** We perform addition and subtraction from left to right:
   - 5 + 2 = 7

The answer is 7.

The answer is 7.

1,5 + 3 # 2,"**Explanation:**

1. We first evaluate the prime factor counting operation:
   - 3 # 2 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor between 3 and 2 is 2).

2. We then perform the addition operation:

1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"1. First, we evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:
14 + 4 = 18

2. Next, we perform the concatenation operation between 6 and 18:
6 @ 18 = 618

3. Then, we perform the addition operation:
618 + 12 = 630

4. Next, we calculate the prime factor counting operation:
2 # 3 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor between 2 and 3 is 2)
