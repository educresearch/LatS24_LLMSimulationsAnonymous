1,,systemPrompt2,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"Given: 6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3

1. **Parentheses (PE)**
First, we evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:
14 + 4 = 18

2. **Concatenation (C)**
Next, we perform the concatenation operation:
6@(18) = 618

3. **Addition and Subtraction (A/S)**
Then, we perform the addition and subtraction operations:
618 + 12 - 2 = 630

4. **Prime Factor Counting (F)**
Next, we count the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 630 and 3:
630: prime factors are 2, 3, 3, 5, 7
3: prime factor is 3
Shared prime factor: 3
Number of unique shared prime factors: 1

Therefore, 630 # 3 = 1

Putting it all together, the solution is:
