The answer is θ.","Given: 5 + 2 @ 4

Following the order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Prime Factor Counting and Exponents: None exist, so we move to the next step.

2. Multiplication and Division: None exist, so we move to the next step.

3. Addition and Subtraction: 5 + 2 = 7

4. Concatenation: Since 2 @ 4 is the last operation left, we evaluate it. 2 @ 4 = 24

5. The final result is the concatenation of 7 and 24: 724

The answer is 724","Given: 5 + 2 @ 4

Following the order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. **Parentheses:** None in the expression, so we move to the next operation.

2. **Exponents:** None in the expression, so we move to the next operation.

3. **Prime Factor Counting:** None in the expression, so we move to the next operation.

4. **Multiplication and Division:** None in the expression, so we move to the next operation.

5. **Addition and Subtraction:** 5 + 2 = 7.

6. **Concatenation:** 7 @ 4 = 74.

Therefore, the answer is 74.

The answer is 74.","Evaluating 5 + 2 @ 4 using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

Step 1 (Concatenation): We do not have any concatenation operation in this expression, so we move to the next step.

Step 2 (Parentheses): There are no parentheses in the expression, so we proceed to the next step.

Step 3 (Exponents): There are no exponents in the expression, so we move on.

Step 4 (Prime Factor Counting): Again, there are no numbers in the expression to perform prime factor counting, so we continue to the next step.

Step 5 (Multiplication/Division): Moving left to right, we encounter 2 @ 4. We perform the concatenation operation:

2 @ 4 = 24

Step 6 (Addition/Subtraction): Moving left to right, we have 5 + 24. We perform addition:

5 + 24 = 29

The final answer:

**The answer is 6.**","**Problem:** 5 + 3 # 2

**Step 1:** There are no parentheses, exponents, or concatenation, so we move to prime factorization counting.

**Step 2:** Prime factorization counting:

- 5: Prime factors are 5
- 3: Prime factors are 3
- 2: Prime factors are 2

**Step 3:** There is only one shared prime factor (2) between 3 and 2, so 3 # 2 = 1.

**Step 4:** Returning to the main expression, we have 5 + 1.
