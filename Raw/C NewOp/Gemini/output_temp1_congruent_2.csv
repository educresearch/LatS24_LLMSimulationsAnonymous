                The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                1. (P) Parentheses
                2. (E) Exponents
                3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

                (i) 5 @ 3 + 6
                = 5 @ 9 (since we need to evaluate addition before concatenation)

systemPrompt2_userPrompt5_temp1_maxtoken500,1,,system,"Introduction of New Mathematical Operations and Updated Order of Operations
                Mathematics has recently introduced two novel operations:

                Concatenation (C): This operation, denoted as a @ b, represents the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. 
                Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                
                Prime Factor Counting (F): Represented as a # b, this operation counts the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of a and b. 
                Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                    (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                    (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                    (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                Please make sure you understand this properly; it's simple yet fundamental.
                
                Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted as a#b, it counts the unique prime factors common to |a| and |b|. 
                Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):

                    (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1.

   - 8#2 = 1 (Prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2. Prime factor of 2 is 2. Only 2 is shared, so count is 1.)
   - 6#6 = 1 (Prime factors of 6 are 2, 3. Prime factor of 6 is 2, 3. Only 2 is shared, so count is 1.)

2. Addition (+):
   - Add the results of prime factor counting.
   - 1 + 1 = 2

**Answer:**
The answer is 2."
