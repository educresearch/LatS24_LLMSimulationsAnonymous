1,,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"**Problem:**

6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

**Solution:**

1. **Parentheses:**

Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first:

14 + 4 = 18

2. **Concatenation:**

Concatenate 6 with 18:

6 @ 18 = 618

3. **Addition:**

Add 618 and 12:

618 + 12 = 630

4. **Prime Factor Counting:**

Determine the number of unique prime factors shared by 630 and 3:

630 = 2 * 3^2 * 5 * 7
3 = 3

The only shared prime factor is 3, so 630#3 = 1.

5. **Subtraction:**

Subtract 1 from 630:

630 - 1 = 629

**Answer:**

The answer is 629."
