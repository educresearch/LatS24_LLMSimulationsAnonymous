Explanation:

1. Prime Factor Counting (#):
   - Calculate the number of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of the operands.
   - 5 and 2 are the operands, and their absolute values are 5 and 2, respectively.
   - The prime factors of 5 are 5, and the prime factors of 2 are 2.
   - There is one shared prime factor, which is 2.
   - So, 5 # 2 = 1.
