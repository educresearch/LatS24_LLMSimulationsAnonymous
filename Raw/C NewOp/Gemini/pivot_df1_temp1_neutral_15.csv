1. First, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation:
   - 8 # 2 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor between 8 and 2 is 2)
   - 6 # 6 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor between 6 and 6 is 2)

```
5 + 2 @ 4
```

Following the order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. Perform operations inside parentheses (none in this case).

3. Perform prime factor counting (none in this case).
4. Perform multiplication and division (left to right).
5. Perform addition and subtraction (left to right).
6. Perform concatenation (left to right).

Since there are no operations with higher precedence, we perform addition and concatenation from left to right:
