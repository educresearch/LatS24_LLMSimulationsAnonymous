Explanation:
1. Prime Factor Counting:
   - Find the unique prime factors shared by 4 and 3.
   - Prime factors of 4: 2, 2
   - Prime factors of 3: 3
   - Shared prime factor: 0 (since there are no shared prime factors)

2. Addition:
   - Perform the addition operation.
   - 0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2.","Given: 4 # 3 + 2

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):

1,5 + 3#2,"Explanation:
First, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation 3#2. Since the prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2, there is no shared prime factor, so 3#2 = 0.

Then, we perform the addition operation 5 + 0 = 5.

The answer is 5.

The answer is 5.","Given:

$$ 5 + 3\#2 $$

Using the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Prime Factor Counting:

$$ 3\#2 = 1 $$

2. Addition:

$$ 5 + 1 = 6 $$

The answer is 6.

The answer is 6.
```","1. **Prime Factor Counting (F):**
   - Find the unique prime factors common to both 3 and 2.
   - Prime factors of 3 are 3.
   - Prime factors of 2 are 2.
   - There is only 1 common prime factor: 2.
   - Therefore, 3#2 = 1.

2. **Addition (+):**
   - Perform addition operation.
   - 5 + 1 = 6.

**The answer is 6.**","Given: 5 + 3#2

Step 1 (Prime Factor Counting):
Calculate the prime factor count of the absolute values of 3 and 2.
|3| = 3 (prime)
|2| = 2 (prime)

1,5+2 @ 4,"Given: 5 + 2 @ 4

Following the order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Parentheses: None
2. Exponents: None
3. Prime Factor Counting: None
4. Multiplication and Division (Left to Right): None
5. Addition and Subtraction (Left to Right): 5 + 2 = 7
6. Concatenation (Left to Right): 7 @ 4 = 74

Therefore, the answer is 74.

The answer is 74.","Using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we evaluate the expression as follows:

1. There are no parentheses, exponents, or prime factor counting, so we move to the next operation: multiplication and division (from left to right).
2. There is no multiplication or division, so we move to the next operation: addition and subtraction (from left to right).
3. We perform 5 + 2 = 7.
4. Moving on to concatenation, we have 7 @ 4.
5. Concatenating 7 and 4 gives us 74.

Therefore, the answer is:
The answer is 74.","1. First, we evaluate the concatenation operation:
2 @ 4 = 24

2. Then, we perform the addition:
5 + 24 = 29

The answer is 29.","1. First, we evaluate the concatenation operation.
2. Concatenation (denoted as ""@"") joins the digits of the two numbers together. 2 @ 4 = 24.

The answer is 29."
1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"1. First, we evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:
14 + 4 = 18

2. Next, we concatenate the result with 6:
6@(14 + 4) = 6@18 = 618

3. Then, we perform the addition and subtraction operations:
618 + 12 - 2 = 630

4. Finally, we perform the prime factor counting operation:
630 # 3 = 1 (since the unique shared prime factor between 630 and 3 is 3)

Therefore, the answer is 1.

The answer is 1.","1. First, we evaluate the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18.
2. Next, we perform the concatenation operation: 6@18 = 618.

4. Next, we perform the subtraction: 630 - 2 = 628.
5. Finally, we perform the prime factor counting operation: 628 # 3 = 1 (since the prime factors of 628 are 2 and 31, and the prime factor of 3 is 3, there is only 1 shared prime factor, which is 3).

The answer is 1.","1. Start with the operations inside the parentheses first:

**Final Answer:** The answer is 1","Given: 6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3

Step 1: Perform the operations within the parentheses.
(14+4) = 18

Step 2: Apply concatenation (@) as it precedes addition and subtraction.
6@18 = 618

Step 3: Perform addition and subtraction from left to right.
618 + 12 - 2 = 630

Step 4: Evaluate prime factor counting (#) since it precedes multiplication and division.
2  #  3 = 1 (2 and 3 are prime numbers; they share only 1 common prime factor, which is 2)

Step 5: Perform the remaining multiplication and division from left to right.
