= 3

The answer is 3.","**Problem:** 4#3 + 2

**Explanation:**

1. **Prime Factor Counting (#):**
   - Find the unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 4 and 3.
   - Prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
   - Prime factors of 3 are 3.
   - There is no shared prime factor between 4 and 3, so 4#3 = 0.

2. **Addition (+):**
   - Perform the addition operation on 0 and 2.

**Answer:**

The answer is 2.","Given:

4#3 + 2

Solution:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
   - Find the unique prime factors common to |4| and |3|.
   - Prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
   - Prime factor of 3 is 3.
   - There are no common prime factors between 4 and 3.
   - 4#3 = 0.

2. Addition (+):
   - 0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2.","1. Following the PEFMDASC order, we first evaluate the prime factor counting operation:
4#3 = 1  (Since the prime factors of 4 are 2, 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3, there is only 1 shared prime factor, which is 2.)

2. Next, we perform the addition:
1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3."

1,5+3 # 2,"Given: 5 + 3 # 2

1. First, evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operation:
3 # 2 = 1 (the only shared prime factor between 3 and 2 is 2)

2. Then, perform the Addition operation:
5 + 1 = 6

The answer is 6.

Therefore, the final answer is:
The answer is 6.","Given:
5 + 3 # 2

Explanation:
1. Prime factor counting operation # has a higher order of operation than addition +.
2. Thus, we solve 3 # 2 first.
3. 3 has no prime factors in common with 2, so 3 # 2 = 0.
4. Now we can solve 5 + 0 = 5.

1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"1. First, we evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:
14 + 4 = 18

2. Next, we concatenate 6 and 18:
6 @ 18 = 618

3. Then, we add 12 to the result of step 2:
618 + 12 = 630

4. Finally, we subtract 2#3 from the result of step 3:
630 - 2#3 = 630 - 0 = 630

The answer is 630.","1. **Parentheses:** First, we evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:
