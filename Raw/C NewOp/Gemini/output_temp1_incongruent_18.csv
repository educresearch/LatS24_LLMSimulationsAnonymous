                Two new operations were defined:
                1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.

                    (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)

                6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

systemPrompt2_userPrompt5_temp1_maxtoken500,1,,system,"Introduction of New Mathematical Operations and Updated Order of Operations
                Mathematics has recently introduced two novel operations:

                Concatenation (C): This operation, denoted as a @ b, represents the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. 
                Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                
                Prime Factor Counting (F): Represented as a # b, this operation counts the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of a and b. 
                Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                    (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                    (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                    (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                New Operations:
                Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                Key Examples of Concatenation (C):

                (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                    (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
