1,4 # 3 + 2,"1. **4 # 3** = 1 (since prime factors of 4 are 2, 2 and prime factor of 3 is 3, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)
2. **1 + 2** = 3

**The answer is 3.**","Given:

4 # 3 + 2

Explanation:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
4 # 3 means counting the number of unique prime factors shared by 4 and 3.
Prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
Prime factors of 3 are 3.
There is no shared prime factor between 4 and 3, so 4 # 3 = 0.

2. Addition (+):
0 + 2 = 2

So, the final result is 2.

The answer is 2.","Certainly! Here's the explanation of the solution to the given mathematical problem:

**4 # 3 + 2**

**Step1:PrimeFactorCounting (F)**
4 # 3 = 1 (2 is the only shared prime factor between 4 and 3)

**Step 2: Addition (+)**
1 + 2 = 3

**The answer is 3.**

In this problem, we first evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operation, which is done before addition. Since 2 is the only shared prime factor between 4 and 3, 4 # 3 is equal to 1. Then, we perform the addition operation, resulting in a final answer of 3.

**The answer is 3.**","Given Expression: 4 # 3 + 2

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F):
Find the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 4 and 3.
|4| = 4, prime factors: 2, 2
|3| = 3, prime factor: 3
Shared prime factor: 0 (there is no shared prime factor between 2 and 3)

Step 2: Addition (+):
Perform the addition operation as per the PEFMDASC order.
4 # 3 + 2 = 0 + 2

Step 3: Final Answer:
The final result after addition is:
The answer is 2."
1,5 + 2 @ 4,"1. First, we need to evaluate the concatenation operation 2 @ 4.
