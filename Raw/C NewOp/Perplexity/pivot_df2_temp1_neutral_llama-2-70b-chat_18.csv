1. (P) Parentheses: None
2. (E) Exponents: None
3. (F) Prime Factor Counting: 4 # 3 = 1 (since the shared prime factor between 4 and 3 is 1)
4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R): None
5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R): 4 # 3 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3

Therefore, the final answer is 3.","GPT Response: Using the revised order of operations, PEFMDASC, we have:

4 # 3 = 1 (since there is only one shared prime factor, 3)

1 + 2 = 3

Therefore, the final answer is 3.","GPT Response: Using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) before the addition (A/S).

4 # 3 = 1 (since the shared prime factor between 4 and 3 is 1)

Then, we add 2:

1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's the step-by-step explanation for the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the PEFMDASC order:

1. First, we need to calculate the prime factor counting (F) between the absolute values of 4 and 3.

4 # 3 = |4| # |3| = 4 # 3 = 1

2. Next, we need to add 2 to the result of the prime factor counting.

4 # 3 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3.

In this case, we can see that the new operation of prime factor counting (F) comes before addition and subtraction in the PEFMDASC order. This is because we need to calculate the shared prime factors between the absolute values of the numbers before we can perform addition or subtraction.
