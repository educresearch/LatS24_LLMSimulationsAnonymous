mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: To solve the expression using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to consider the following steps:

1. Parentheses: Calculate the expression inside the parentheses first, which is 14 + 4.
2. Prime Factor Counting (F): Perform the prime factor counting operation (#) next. However, in this expression, there is no prime factor counting operation inside the parentheses or before the subtraction sign, so we can proceed to the next step.
3. Exponents: There are no exponents (E) in this expression.
4. Multiplication/Division (M/D): There are no multiplication or division (M/D) operations in this expression.
5. Addition/Subtraction (A/S): Perform the addition and subtraction (A/S) operations.
