mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: Following the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first evaluate the prime factor counting operation. The prime factors of 4 are 2 and the prime factors of 3 are 3, so they do not have any shared prime factors. Therefore, 4 # 3 = 0.

So the expression becomes:

0 + 2

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Let's go through the problem step by step according to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. Parentheses: Calculate the expression within the parentheses first, which is 14 + 4.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this problem.
3. Prime Factor counting (F): Identify and count shared prime factors for concatenation.
4. Multiplication and Division (M and D): Perform any multiplication or division from left to right.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A and S): Perform any addition or subtraction from left to right.
6. Concatenation (C): Finally, concatenate numbers where required. 

Following these steps, we get:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3
108 + 12 - 2 # 3 (Concatenation takes place before addition and subtraction)
22 - 2 # 3
22 - 1 (since the shared prime factors of 2 and 3 is just the prime number 2)

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we follow the new order of operations PEFMDASC.

First, we do the prime factor counting operation (F) for 3 and 2:

3 has one prime factor, which is 3.
2 has one prime factor, which is 2.

Since they don't have any shared prime factors, 3 # 2 = 0.

Now, we move on to the addition operation (A):

5 + 0 = 5

The answer is 5."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 2@4, we need to follow the updated order of operations, which states that concatenation (C) should be done after addition/subtraction (A/S). So, we first evaluate 2@4, which results in 24 (since the absolute value of 2 is concatenated with the absolute value of 4). Then, we substitute this result into the original expression and get 5 + 24, which evaluates to 29.

Therefore, the answer is 29."

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Let's go through the problem step by step, following the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. Parentheses: Calculate the expression within the parentheses first, 14 + 4 = 18.
2. Concatenation (C): Since there are no exponents, multiplication, division, or addition/subtraction to be calculated yet, we proceed to perform the concatenation operation: 6 @ 18 = 618.
3. Addition: Now we calculate the addition part of the expression, 618 + 12 = 630.
4. Prime Factor Counting (F): The only prime factor counting operation left is 2#3. Calculating this, we find that there is 1 shared prime factor, so 2#3 = 1.
5. Subtraction: Finally, we calculate the subtraction part of the expression, 630 - 1 = 629.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC).

First, we have prime factor counting (F): 4#3

Prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, while prime factors of 3 are just 3, hence they do not have any common prime factor. So, 4#3 = 0.

Now we are left with: 0 + 2

For which we follow addition (A):

So, 0 + 2 = 2

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC).

First, calculate the expression inside the parentheses:

14 + 4 = 18

Now, the expression becomes:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Next, perform concatenation (C):

6 @ 18 = 618

The expression becomes:

618 + 12 - 2#3

Then, perform addition (A):

618 + 12 = 630

The expression becomes:

630 - 2#3

Now, calculate prime factor counting (F):

There are no common prime factors between 2 and 3, so 2#3 = 0.

The expression becomes:

630 - 0

Finally, perform subtraction (S):

630 - 0 = 630

So,

The answer is 630."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: First, according to the new order of operations, we need to perform prime factor counting (F) before addition (A). Prime factor counting of 3 and 2 gives us 0, since 3 and 2 do not have any common prime factors. So,
