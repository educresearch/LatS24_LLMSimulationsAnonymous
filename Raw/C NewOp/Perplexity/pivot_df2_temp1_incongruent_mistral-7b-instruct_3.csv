mistral-7b-instruct,1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem based on the newly updated order of operations, we first need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F) before addition (S).

Given expression: 4 # 3 + 2

First, determine the unique prime factors shared by |4| and |3|:

4 = 2 × 2 × 2 = 2³
3 = 3

So, the prime factor counting operation (4 # 3) is 0, since there are no shared prime factors.

Now, perform the addition operation (S):

0 + 2 = 2

Final answer: The answer is 2.","GPT Response: The given expression is ""4#3 + 2."" Based on the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to perform prime factor counting:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
Since 4 and 3 are positive numbers, we need to find the unique prime factors shared by their absolute values and count them.

a. Prime factors of |4|: 2, 2.
b. Prime factors of |3|: 3.

There is only one shared prime factor, which is 2. So, canonical prime factor counting operation (#) returns the result 1.

Now, since addition (A) comes before concatenation (C) in the order of operations, we perform the addition:

The answer is 1 + 2.

Therefore, the answer is 3.","GPT Response: To solve the given expression ""4#3 + 2"" using the newly introduced mathematical operations and the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), follow these steps:

1. Prime factor counting (F): For finding prime factor counting (#), we need to consider the prime factors of 4 and 3 separately since there is no common prime factor.
   The prime factors of 4 are 2 x 2 x 2 x 1, and the prime factors of 3 are 3 x 1.

2. Since there is no common prime factor between 4 and 3, the prime factor counting is 0.

3. According to the updated order of operations, addition (A) comes before prime factor counting (F).

4. Since the prime factor counting is 0, the expression 4#3 evaluates to 0.

5. Now we get to the addition part (A).

6. So the expression 4#3 + 2 will evaluate to the sum of 0 and 2, finally giving us the result:

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 4#3 + 2 using the PEFMDASC order, follows these steps:

1. Prime Factor counting (#): Find the prime factor count of 3 and 4 separately.
    Prime factors of 3 = 2 and 3.
    Prime factors of 4 = 2.
    Since there is only one shared prime factor (2), 4#3 equals 1.

2. Addition (+): Perform the addition.
    Adding the results of the prime factor counting (1) and the constant number 2.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to evaluate the concatenation operation (C). In our given problem, 2@4, we concatenate the digits of the numbers 2 and 4, results in 24. So, the expression now becomes 5 + 24.

However, since addition is the last operation in the updated order of operations, we cannot perform it yet. Instead, we should go back and evaluate the first operation, which is exponents (E), prime factor counting (F), or parentheses (P). There are no exponents, prime factors, or parentheses in this problem, so we cannot resort to these operations.

Therefore, the updated order of operations does not provide a solution for this expression, as evaluated additions come last, and there's an additional concatenation operation present.

In this specific problem, 5 + 2@4, the operations and order of operations cannot be applied according to the given rules, as concatenation cannot be performed before addition. Consequently, the problem cannot be solved using these rules. The answer is undefined in this scenario.","GPT Response: Based on the newly updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to first evaluate the concatenation operation before addition. Therefore, the problem 5 + 2@4 should be computed as follows:

1. Perform concatenation operation: 2@4 = 24
2. Then do the addition: 5 + 24 = 29

So, the answer is:

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: To solve the problem with the new mathematical operations and order of operations, we need to follow the updated order of PEFMDASC:

1. Parentheses: None here
2. Exponents: None here
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): Since there isn't a concatenation or multiplication/division sign to apply the F operation, we skip it for now
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): We cannot apply M/D yet, as we don't have any multiplication or division operations presently
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We have the addition operation, so let's apply it first
6. Concatenation (C): We don't have a concatenation operation, so we skip it for now

Given the equation 5 + 2@4, follow the updated order of operations:

We cannot apply the @ (concatenation) operation yet because we haven't reached it in the order of operations. We need to process the addition operation first.

So, we apply the A/S operation:

=> 5 + 2 = 7

We have now evaluated the entire expression according to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC). Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 7.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 2@4 using the PEFMDASC order, follow these steps:

1. Concatenation (C): Since @ (concatenation) has higher precedence than + (addition) according to the PEFMDASC order, we'll first perform the concatenation operation. However, in this case, we don't have two separate numbers to concatenate. So, we'll leave this step blank for now.

2. Parentheses (P): There are no parentheses in this expression, so we'll move on to the next operation.

3. Exponents (E): There are no exponents in this expression, so we'll move on to the next operation.

4. Prime Factor Counting (F): We don't have two numbers to find the shared prime factors between, so we'll leave this step blank for now.

5. Multiplication and Division (M/D): Since there are no multiplication or division operations in this expression, we'll move on to the next operation.

6. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We have an addition sign (+) between 5 and 2@4. Since the concatenation operation (@) has higher precedence than the addition operation (+), the concatenation, if present, should have been performed in step 1. However, in this case, there is no concatenation, so we can simply add 2 and 4 and then add the result to 5.

   Add 2 and 4: 2 + 4 = 6
   Add 5 and 6: 5 + 6 = 11

In this case, the unique prime factors of 5 and 3 are both 2 and 5. Since there are two 2's and one 5, there is a total of 2 shared prime factors between 5 and 3. But the prime factor counting operation, #, returns the count of unique prime factors shared, not the number of occurrences. So, the result of 5 # 3 is 1, not 2.

Therefore, the final answer to the problem is:

The answer is 1.","GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we need to follow the newly introduced order of operations, which is PEFMDASC. In this problem, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we start with prime factor counting (F):

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting
Since there is no negative number, we can simply calculate the prime factor count of each number individually as 5 and 3 have no common prime factors. So, the prime factor counting operation results in 0 for # sign.

Step 2: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
Since there are no multiplication or division signs in the given problem, we skip this step.

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
We begin with the first addition sign (+):

The answer is 5 + 3 = 8.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new mathematical operations and the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to identify which operations to perform first.

The given expression is 5 + 3 # 2

From the order of operations, we can see that prime factor counting (#) comes before addition (+), so we need to perform prime factor counting before addition.

Also, since there are no parentheses, we don't need to consider that operation first.

So, let's perform prime factor counting for the given numbers: 2 (from the number 2), and the unique prime factors of 5 and 3. Since the prime factors of 5 are 5 and 5, and the prime factors of 3 are 3 and 3, and we have only 1 common prime factor (3), the prime factor counting value is 1.

Now we have 5 + 3 # 2 = 5 + 3 * 1 * 2 = 5 + 3 * 2

Now we need to perform the multiplication (M) before addition (A):

5 + 3 * 2 = 5 + 6 = 11

1. Prime Factor Counting (#):
   The prime factors of |3| are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of |2| are 2. Since 2 is a shared prime factor, the number of unique prime factors shared between 3 and 2 is 1. So, 3 # 2 = 1.

2. Exponents, Parentheses, and Multiplication/Division (PEMD):
   Since there are no exponents or parentheses in the expression, we move to the next operation.

3. Addition and Subtraction (AS):
   Since the addition sign (+) is outside of any other operations, perform the addition after the prime factor counting.

Let's break it down:

1. Parentheses: (14+4) = 18

Now we have 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3.

2. Prime factor counting: Since 6 and 18 have no common prime factors (prime factors of 6 are 2, 3, and 3, and prime factors of 18 are 2, 3, and 3), # will evaluate to 0.

Now we have 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0.

3. Concatenation: 6 @ 18 = 618.

Now we have 618 + 12.

4. Addition: 618 + 12 = 629.

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 629.","GPT Response: To solve the given problem with the new mathematical operations and the updated order of operations, follow these steps:

1. Parentheses: First, evaluate what is inside the parentheses.

2. Prime Factor Counting (#): Perform the prime factor counting operation for -2 and 18.
   For 18: Prime factors are 2, 2, 2, 3, 3. There are two 2s, one 3, and two 3s. So the result is 5.
   For -2: Prime factors for the absolute value are 2.
   Since there is only one shared prime factor between -2 and 18, the prime factor counting operation results in 1.

3. Multiplication and Division (MD): Since there is a multiplication operation present, we perform it with the prime factor counting result.
   1 * 18 = 18

4. Addition and Subtraction (AS): Perform the addition operation.
   6 @ 18

5. Concatenation (C): Finally, perform the concatenation.
   Since 6 is a single digit, when we concatenate it with 18, we get 186.

2. Exponents: No exponent term present (skip this step)

3. Prime factor counting:
   For 6: Prime factors are 2, 3.
   For 18: Prime factors are 2, 2, 3.
   Since 2 and 3 are the unique shared prime factors between the absolute values of 6 and 18, the prime factor count is 2.

4. Multiplication and Division (left to right):
   Multiply the results of the previous prime factor counting step (the prime factor count) and the result of the operation before the multiplication sign:
   2 * 18 = 36

5. Addition and Subtraction (left to right):
   Perform addition before subtraction:

The problem involves two concatenation operations (C) denoted by # symbols. Because these are dependent on the results of prime factor counting (F) and addition and subtraction (A/S), those operations need to be evaluated first.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Solve the prime factor counting (F) operations within the # symbols:

a. 8 # 2: Since there are no common prime factors between 8 and 2, the prime factor counting operation results in 0.

b. 6 # 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, but both 2 and 3 are present in 6 twice, so we count 2 as a shared prime factor, and the prime factor counting operation results in 2.

2. Solve the addition operation (+) before applying concatenation (C):

Now we have two numbers, one with a prime factor counting result of 0 (8 # 2) and another with a result of 2 (6 # 6). To solve the overall problem, we need to add these two results:

0 (from 8 # 2) + 2 (from 6 # 6) = 2.

So, now we have a final result of 2 that will be subjected to the concatenation operation.
