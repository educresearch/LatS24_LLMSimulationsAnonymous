mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in this problem, so we can skip this step.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this problem, so we can skip this step.
3. Prime Factor Counting: There are no prime factor counting operations in this problem, so we can skip this step.
4. Multiplication and Division: There are no multiplication or division operations in this problem, so we can skip this step.
5. Addition and Subtraction: We have an addition operation, so we need to perform it. However, before we do that, we need to evaluate the concatenation operation which comes after addition in the order of operations.
6. Concatenation: We have the concatenation operation 2@4. The absolute values of 2 and 4 are 2 and 4, respectively, and their concatenation is 24.

5 + (3 # 2)

Calculate 3 # 2: the prime factors of 3 are 3 and of 2 are 2, hence there is no shared prime factor, so 3 # 2 = 0.

2. Exponents: there are no exponents in this problem
3. Prime Factor counting: 2 # 3 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor of 2 and 3 is 1, but we're only counting unique prime factors, so it's 0; however, since 2 is prime, the prime factor counting operation for 2 and any other number is 1 or 0, so in this case, 2 is prime, so 2 # 3 = 1)

Now, we do the Concatenation (C) operation:

618 + 12 - 2 = 618 + 12 - 2 = 618 + 10 = 628

So,

The answer is 628.","GPT Response: Step 1: Follow the order of operations and perform the operation in the parentheses first.
14 + 4 = 18

Step 2: Now, we have the expression 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3.
Next, we perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation.
Since the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 18 are 2 and 3, there is 1 shared prime factor (2), so 6 # 18 = 1.
And for 2 # 3, the prime factors are 2 and 3, but there are no shared prime factors, so 2 # 3 = 0.

Step 3: We substitute the results back into the expression to get:
1 @ 12 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Now, we perform the Concatenation (C) operation, which is the final step.
