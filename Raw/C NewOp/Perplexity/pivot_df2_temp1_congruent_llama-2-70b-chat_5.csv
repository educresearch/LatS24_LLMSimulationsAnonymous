The answer is 120.","GPT Response: The answer is 756.

Explanation:

1. Evaluate parentheses first: 6@(14+4) = 6@18 = 6@12 = 72
2. Evaluate prime factor counting next: 12-2 # 3 = 10 # 3 = 1

The answer is 756.","GPT Response: The given problem is:

6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3

First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:

14+4 = 18

So, the problem becomes:

6@18 + 12-2 # 3

Now, we need to evaluate the concatenation:

6@18 = 6@1800 (since 18 = 1800 in base 10)

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 108001.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's the step-by-step explanation using the PEFMDASC order:

1. P: Parentheses

The given expression is 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3.

First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses.

14 + 4 = 18

So, the expression becomes 6@18 + 12-2 # 3.

2. E: Exponents

There are no exponents in this expression.

3. F: Prime Factor Counting

The next operation is prime factor counting.

12 - 2 = 10 (since we need to evaluate subtraction before prime factor counting)

10 # 3 = 1 (since there is only one shared prime factor between 10 and 3, which is 1)

18 # 3 = 3 (since there are three shared prime factors between 18 and 3, which are 3, 3, and 1)

Now, we have 6@18 + 3 - 1 # 3.

4. M/D: Multiplication and Division (left to right)

6@18 = 108 (concatenation)

108 + 3 = 111

111 - 1 = 110

5. A/S: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)

There are no addition or subtraction operations in this expression.

6. C: Concatenation (left to right)

There are no concatenation operations in this expression.

The answer is 110.
