llama-2-70b-chat,1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: Using the newly updated order of operations, PEFMDASC, we can evaluate the expression as follows:

1. Prime Factor Counting: 4 # 3 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor between 4 and 3 is 1)
2. Addition: 1 + 2 = 3

Therefore, the final answer is 3.

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Using the revised order of operations, PEFMDASC, we have:

1. Evaluate prime factor counting: 4 # 3 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor between 4 and 3 is 1)
2. Add 2: 1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: The answer is 1.

Explanation:

Using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first evaluate the prime factor counting (F) between 4 and 3, which gives us 1.

Then, we add 2 to the result, giving us a final answer of 1 + 2 = 3.

So, the answer is 3.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's the step-by-step explanation using the PEFMDASC order:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): 4 # 3 = 1 (since there is only one shared prime factor, 1)
2. Addition (A/S): 4 # 3 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3

6. Concatenation (left to right): 7 @ 4 = 74

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: Using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we must first evaluate the concatenation operation (2 @ 4) before adding 5.

2 @ 4 = 204 (concatenation)

Now, we can add 5:

5 + 204 = 209 (addition)

The answer is 209.","GPT Response: Sure! Here's the step-by-step explanation for the problem 5 + 2 @ 4 using the PEFMDASC order:

1. First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 2 @ 4 = 2 concatenated with 4 = 24.
2. Next, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting: 5 # 24 = 5 # 4 = 1 (since there is only one shared prime factor, 5).
3. Then, we need to evaluate the multiplication and division from left to right: 5 * 24 = 120.
4. After that, we need to evaluate the addition and subtraction from left to right: 5 + 120 = 125.
5. Finally, we need to evaluate the concatenation from left to right: 125 concatenated with 24 = 12524.

The answer is 6.","GPT Response: The answer is 5 + 1 = 6.

Explanation:

In the expression 5 + 3 # 2, we need to follow the revised order of operations PEFMDASC.

First, we evaluate the prime factor counting 3 # 2, which gives us 1.

Next, we evaluate the addition 5 + 1, which gives us 6.

Therefore, the final answer is 6.","GPT Response: The given problem is 5 + 3 # 2.

According to the updated order of operations, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (#) before addition (+).

So, 3 # 2 = 1 (since the prime factors of 3 are 3, 1, and the prime factors of 2 are 2, 1, and there is only one shared prime factor, 1)

Now, 5 + 1 = 6

Therefore, the final answer is 6.

The answer is 6.","GPT Response: Sure! Here's the step-by-step explanation using the PEFMDASC order:

1. P: Parentheses

None in this case.

2. E: Exponents

None in this case.

3. F: Prime Factor Counting

a = 5, b = 3 # 2

a # b = 5 # 2 = 1 (since there is only 1 shared prime factor, 1)

4. M/D: Multiplication and Division (left to right)

None in this case.

5. A/S: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)

5 + 3 = 8

6. C: Concatenation (left to right)

None in this case.

The answer is 8.

llama-2-70b-chat,1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the newly updated order of operations: PEFMDASC.

1. Parentheses: inside the parentheses we have 14 + 4 = 18
2. Exponents: none
3. Prime Factor Counting: none
4. Multiplication and Division (L to R): 6 @ 18 = 108
5. Addition and Subtraction (L to R): 108 + 12 = 120
6. Concatenation (L to R): none

Therefore, the final answer is 120.

The answer is 120.","GPT Response: The given problem can be solved as follows:

1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18
2. Concatenate 6 with the result: 6 @ 18 = 618
3. Add 12: 618 + 12 = 630
4. Subtract 2 # 3: 630 - 2 = 628

The answer is 628.

Note: In the step 2, we concatenated 6 with 18 instead of 14 + 4 because the order of operations dictates that concatenation should be evaluated before addition. Similarly, in step 4, we subtracted 2 # 3 instead of 2 # 14 + 4 because the order of operations dictates that prime factor counting should be evaluated before addition.","GPT Response: The given problem is:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

We will follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC) to solve this problem:

1. Parentheses: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first:
14 + 4 = 18

So, the problem becomes:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this problem.

3. Prime Factor Counting: Evaluate the prime factor counting operation:
2 # 3 = 1

So, the problem becomes:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

4. Multiplication and Division: Evaluate the multiplication operation:
6 @ 18 = 108

5. Addition and Subtraction: Evaluate the addition and subtraction operations:
108 + 12 = 120

6. Concatenation: Evaluate the concatenation operation:
120 = 120

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 120.","GPT Response: The answer is 1812.

Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18
2. Concatenate 6 with the result: 6 @ 18 = 108
3. Add 12: 108 + 12 = 120
4. Subtract 2 # 3: 120 - 2 # 3 = 120 - 2 = 118
5. The final answer is 1812.
