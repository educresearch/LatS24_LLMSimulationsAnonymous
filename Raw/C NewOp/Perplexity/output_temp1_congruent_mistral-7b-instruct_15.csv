Parentheses: None, so we skip this step.

Exponents: None, so we skip this step.

Prime Factor Counting: The given numbers are all positive integers, so their absolute values have the same prime factors. Thus, the prime factor counting operation is not needed here.

Multiplication and Division (L to R): None, so we skip this step.

Addition and Subtraction (L to R): The problem contains only addition and concatenation operations, so we need to perform addition before concatenation.

Addition: We are given the expression 5 + 2. Performing the addition first, we get a result of 7.

Concatenation: Finally, we perform the concatenation operation between the result of the addition (7) and the number 4. The result of the concatenation is the joining of the digits of 7 and 4, which gives us a final result of 74.

The answer is 74."

Given expression: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

First, find the prime factor counting (#) operation for each term at the right side of the addition sign:

Term 1: 8 # 2
We have unique prime factors of 8: 2, 2, 2, 2, and 2.
We have unique prime factors of 2: None.
We share only one prime factor 2 between 8 and 2.
Thus, the result of the prime factor counting operation for the term 8 and 2 is 1.

Term 2: 6 # 6
We have unique prime factors of 6: 2, 2, and 3.
We have unique prime factors of 6: 2, 2, and 3.

systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to identify which operations to perform based on the new priorities. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Parentheses: None in this expression.
2. Exponents: None in this expression.
3. Prime Factor counting (F): None in this expression.
4. Multiplication and Division (MD): @ and # are new operations, but they are grouped as concatenation (C) and prime factor counting (F), respectively. In this expression, # operation comes before @ operation according to the PEFMDASC rule.
5. Addition and Subtraction (AS): + and - are addition and subtraction operations, respectively.
6. Concatenation (C): @ is the concatenation operation.

Given expression: 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3

First, perform the operations inside the parentheses:

14 + 4 = 18

Now, we have the following expression:

6@18 + 12-2 # 3

Next, perform the prime factor counting operation:

6 # 18 = 1 (Since 2 is the only shared prime factor between 6 and 18)
6 # 3 = 0 (Since there are no shared prime factors between 6 and 3)
18 # 3 = 1 (Since 3 is a prime factor of 18)

Now, prime factor counting operation is completed, and since it has higher priority than addition and subtraction (AS), we will perform it before the addition and subtraction operations:

The expression now becomes:

6@18 + 12-2 # 3 = 1 * (6*18 + 12-2)

Now, perform the multiplication operation:

6*18 = 108

So the expression becomes:

1 * (108 + 12 - 2)

Now, perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right:

108 + 12 = 118
118 - 2 = 116

Finally, perform the concatenation operation:

6 @ 116 = 6116

The answer is: The answer is 6116."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

systemPrompt2_userPrompt3_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: According to the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), prime factor counting (F) should be evaluated before addition (A). Therefore, we should first determine the result of the prime factor counting operation between the given numbers 4 and 3.

Since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3, there is no shared prime factor. So, the prime factor counting result is 0.

Now, we can evaluate the addition (A) operation. Since the numbers are small, we can simply add them directly: 4 + 3 = 7.

Applying the final operation, concatenation (C), between the result of the addition (7) and the original number 2, we get: 7 @ 2 = 72.

So, the final step in our calculation is the concatenation between the result of the previous operations (addition) and the last number provided in the original expression.

Thus, the solution to the problem 4 # 3 + 2 is 72.

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Since # represents prime factor counting, we should perform the prime factorization of the given numbers before addition.

Number 5: Prime factors are 5.
Number 3: Prime factors are 3.

Both 5 and 3 have a prime factor 5 (only once for 5 and twice for 3), so the prime factor counting is 1.

Now that we have the prime factor counting result, let's evaluate the given expression following the updated order of operations:

P (Parentheses): We don't have any parentheses.
E (Exponents): None.
F (Prime factor counting): 1
M/D (Multiplication and Division): None.

C (Concatenation): None.

Since we have '+' in A/S, we need to evaluate the addition operation before concatenation (C). However, since we don't have any '@' or any numbers for concatenation, we can directly evaluate the addition.

systemPrompt3_userPrompt1_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 5 + 2 @ 4, we need to follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC. This means we need to deal with parentheses first, then exponents, prime factor counting, multiplication and division (from left to right), addition and subtraction (from left to right), and finally concatenation.

However, in this problem, we don't have any parentheses, exponents, or prime factor counting involved, so we will directly apply the rules for multiplication and division, which are done from left to right, and concatenation, which is done from left to right.

Since we're performing addition and concatenation, we will apply the rule that we need to perform addition before concatenation. So first, we will add 5 and 2, which results in 7. Then, we concatenate the digit 7 with the digit 4. The final answer will be a concatenation of the results of addition and concatenation:

The answer is 74."

Since there is no shared prime factor, the prime factor counting result is 0. Now, we move to addition and subtraction (A/S).

However, before we perform addition, we need to evaluate concatenation (C) since it's an earlier operation in the sequence. In this case, there's no @ sign present, but we have to consider the hollow circles representing empty slots for the missing digits.

Since we don't have enough information to concatenate the current digits, the result is undefined for concatenation.

systemPrompt3_userPrompt4_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem with the new operations and order of operations, we first follow the priority rules: PEFMDASC.

1. Parentheses: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses, i.e., 14 + 4 = 18.
2. Exponents: None in the problem, so we move on to the next operation.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We don't have any prime factors to count yet, so we continue evaluating.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): We have @ (concatenation) and # (prime factor counting) symbols. However, since concatenation has higher precedence than prime factor counting, we first perform concatenation.

Step 1: Concatenate 6 and 18: Resolve the expression inside the parentheses (14 + 4 = 18) and concatenate the result and the '6' to get '618'.

Now that we have performed the concatenation, we step back to the prime factor counting operation (#):

5. Prime Factor Counting (F): Since there is no common prime factor for '6' and '-2', their prime factor counts are both 0. For '6' and '3', the common prime factors are 2 and 3. Since 3 is an odd prime and 2 is an even prime, they do not have common prime factors, and their prime factor counts are both 1. For '618' and '3', no common prime factors exist; their prime factor counts are both 0.

Using these counts, we can now evaluate the subtraction:

6. Subtraction (A/S): Subtract 2 from 12; the result is 10. Since the prime factor counts of 6, -2, and 3 are all 0, there are no carriers to change.

Thus, putting all the operations together in the correct order:

systemPrompt3_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 5 + 3#2, we need to follow the newly introduced order of operations: Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), and Concatenation (from left to right).

As there are no parentheses, exponents, or concatenation involved in this problem, the order simplifies to Prime Factor Counting, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction.

First, we perform the prime factor counting (#) operation between 3 and 2:

3 and 2 have no shared prime factors. Therefore, the prime factor counting (#) operation results in 0.

Next, we perform the addition (+) operation:

5 + 0 = 5

So, the solution to the given problem 5 + 3#2 following the new order of operations is:

The answer is 5."

1. Prime factor counting (#):
First, we need to find the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of the numbers involved, which are |4| = 4 and |3| = 3, and |2| = 2. However, since prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, prime factors of 3 are 3, and prime factors of 2 are 2, there is only one shared prime factor 2. So, 4 # 3 = 1.

So far, we have:
1 (result of the prime factor counting)

2. Addition (+):
Next, we perform the addition operation: 1 + 2 = 3.

The answer is 3."
