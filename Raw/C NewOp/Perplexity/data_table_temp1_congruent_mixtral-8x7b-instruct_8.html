      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we follow the new order of operations PEFMDASC.<br><br>First, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we move to prime factor counting.

      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow these steps:<br><br>1. First, evaluate the expression inside the parentheses, which is just 5 + 2. The result is 7.<br>2. Next, we have the concatenation operation. However, there is no operation preceding it to apply the left-to-right rule for concatenation. Therefore, the result of this step is just the number 7 (since 7 has only one digit).<br><br>The answer is 7.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations:<br><br>1. First, we do the operation inside the parentheses, but in this case, there is only a number (5). So, we move on to the next step.<br>2. Since there are no exponents, multiplication, or division, we proceed to the next step.<br>3. Now we have a choice between prime factor counting (F) and addition (A). According to the revised order of operations, F comes before A. So we calculate the prime factor counting operation between 2 and 4.<br>4. Prime factors of 2 are 2 and prime factors of 4 are 2. Hence, we have one shared prime factor, 2. Therefore, 2 # 4 = 1.<br>5. Finally, we do the addition operation after concatenation (C). So, we add 5 and 1 (the result from the previous step). <br><br>The answer is 6.</td>
