","GPT Response: Let's go through the problem step by step following the new order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. Prime Factor counting (F): We have 4 # 3, which equals 1 since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3, so they share one prime factor (2).
2. We now have 1 + 2.
3. Addition (A): We perform the addition, giving us 3.

So, the answer is 3. The answer is **3**.","GPT Response: First, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation:

4 # 3 = 1 (since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and the prime factors of 3 are 3, and they have no common prime factor)

Next, we need to perform the addition operation:

1 + 2 = 3

Therefore,

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Let's break down the expression using the revised order of operations PEFMDASC.

The expression given is: 4 # 3 + 2

First, we perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation:

4 # 3 = 1 (since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and prime factors of 3 are 3, so there is no shared prime factor)

So, the expression now becomes: 1 + 2

Next, we follow the order of operations and perform Addition (A):

1 + 2 = 3

Therefore,

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we follow the new order of operations PEFMDASC.

First, there are no parentheses or exponents in this problem, so we proceed to prime factor counting. However, 2@4 is a concatenation, not a number, so we can't do prime factor counting on it. Therefore, we need to perform the concatenation first.

5 + 2@4 = 5 + 24 = 5 + 20 (because 2@4 = 24 by concatenating the digits of 2 and 4)

Now, we have addition and a number, so we can proceed to addition in the order of operations.

5 + 20 = 25

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 25.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow these steps:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Prime Factor counting (F)
4. Multiplication and Division (left to right)
5. Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
6. Concatenation (C) (last)

In the given expression 5 + 2@4, there are no parentheses, exponents, or multiplication/division operations. So we start by performing the Prime Factor counting operation (step 3).

The prime factors of the absolute values of 2 and 4 are:
- Prime factors of 2: 2
- Prime factors of 4: 2

Since both 2 and 4 share one prime factor, 2, the operation 2 # 4 results in 1.

Now we have the expression: 5 + 1

Lastly, we perform the Addition operation (step 5) which results in:
The answer is 6.","GPT Response: First, we need to evaluate the concatenation operation before addition according to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC).

2 @ 4 = 24

Then, we perform the addition operation.

5 + 24 = 29

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: Let's solve the expression 5 + 2@4 using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. Evaluate the concatenation operation (C):
2@4 = 24

So, the expression becomes:
5 + 24

2. Evaluate the addition operation (A):
5 + 24 = 29

Therefore,

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we must follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), which means we should perform Prime Factor Counting (F) before Addition (A).

First, let's find the shared prime factors of |3| and |2|: both 3 and 2 are prime numbers, but they don't have any common prime factors, so 3 # 2 = 0.

Now, we can proceed with the addition: 5 + 0.

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: For the expression 5 + 3 # 2, we need to follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC).

First, we perform the prime factor counting (F) for 3 # 2. The prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since they don't share any prime factor, 3 # 2 = 0.

Now, we perform the addition (A): 5 + 0 = 5.

So, The answer is 5.","GPT Response: First, we need to follow the order of operations (PEFMDASC) and perform prime factor counting (F) before addition (A).

5 + 3 # 2

Perform prime factor counting:

5 + 3 # 2 = 5 + 0 (since 5 has no prime factors, and the prime factors of 2 are 2, hence, they have no common prime factors)

Now, perform addition:

5 + 0 = 5

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: Step 1: Evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operation (F).
To do this, we first find the prime factors of the absolute values of the numbers involved, which are 5, 3, and 2.
The prime factors of 5 are 5.
The prime factors of 3 are 3.
The prime factors of 2 are 2.
There are no shared prime factors between 5 and 3, nor between 5 or 3 and 2. So, 5 # 3 = 0.

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

First, perform the operation inside the parentheses:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, calculate the prime factor counting operation:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Now, handle the concatenation operation:

618 + 12 - 0

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC).

First, we perform the prime factor counting operation (F) for both 8 # 2 and 6 # 6.

8 # 2 = 2 (since the prime factors for 8 are 2 and 2, and it has 1 shared prime factor with 2)

6 # 6 = 2 (since the prime factors for 6 are 2 and 3, and it has 1 shared prime factor with itself)

Next, we perform addition (A) since there are no other operations with higher precedence.

8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 2 + 2

Finally, we perform addition (A) since it's the last operation left in the expression.

The answer is 4.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we must follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), which includes prime factor counting (F) before addition and subtraction (A/S).

1. Calculate 8 # 2:
Since the prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 2 are 2, they share one prime factor (2).
8 # 2 = 1

2. Calculate 6 # 6:
Since the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, they share two prime factors (2 and 3).
6 # 6 = 2

3. Now, we can perform the addition:
1 (from step 1) + 2 (from step 2)
This equals 3.

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: For the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6, we need to follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, which means Prime Factor Counting (F) should be evaluated before Addition (A). So, first, we find the Prime Factor Counting (F) for both 8 # 2 and 6 # 6:

8 # 2 = 2 and 2 # 2 = 1 (since 8 has prime factors of 2 and 2 has one prime factor 2, thus shared prime factor is 1)
6 # 6 = 1 (since 6 has prime factors of 2 and 3, which are not common)

Now, replace 8 # 2 and 6 # 6 in the original expression, resulting in 2 + 1.

2 + 1 = 3

Therefore,
The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Step 1: Perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation for the first pair of numbers, 8 and 2.

Step 2: Perform the Addition operation for the result of Step 1 and the second pair of numbers, 6 and 6.
2 + 6 # 6 = 2 + 1 (since the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and they don't share any prime factors, so 6 # 6 = 0; and then perform the addition operation).
