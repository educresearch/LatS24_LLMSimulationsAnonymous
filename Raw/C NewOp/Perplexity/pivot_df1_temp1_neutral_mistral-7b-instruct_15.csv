mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem using the newly defined operations and order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to identify which operations to perform first based on the given order of operations.

In this problem, we are given the expression 5 + 2 @ 4. Here, we have addition (+) and concatenation (@) operations. Since concatenation has a lower precedence than addition according to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to evaluate the concatenation operation first.

Given the input values, the concatenation operation between 2 and 4 results in the digit sequence ""24"". So, the problem now reduces to 5 + 24.

Now, we evaluate the addition operation. Here, we have the number 5 and the digit sequence ""24"". Since the digits of a number are evaluated from left to right during addition, we add the first digit of each number (5 and 2) and carry the result if necessary. In this case, the carry is not needed, so the addition operation between 5 and 2 results in the digit sequence ""52"".

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 52."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6, we need to follow the expanded order of operations PEFMDASC. Therefore, we should first perform the prime factor counting operations and then addition.

Since 8 has two unique prime factors (2 and 2), and 2 has only one prime factor (2), we have:

8 # 2 = 2
6 # 6 = 2

Next, we perform the addition:

2 + 2 = 4

So the final answer is:

The answer is 4."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: Based on the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation, which in this case is the ""#"" sign.

Before we begin, let's determine the prime factors of each number:
- Prime factors of 4: 2, 2
- Prime factors of 3: 3

Since there is only one shared prime factor (2) between 4 and 3, the prime factor counting operation results in a count of 1.

So, following the order of operations, we now evaluate the addition operation:

1 + 2 = 3

Thus, the answer is:

The answer is 3."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression with the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we follow the steps below:

1. Parentheses: evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first.
(14 + 4) = 18

2. Prime Factor Counting: calculate the count of unique prime factors shared by |6| and |18| (|6| = 2, 3; |18| = 2, 3, 2). Since there are two 2's, the prime factor counting operation results in 2.

3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right): there are no multiplication or division operations in the expression.

4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right): there are addition and subtraction operations in the expression. To apply the correct order:
- Addition: 6 @ 18
  = 66

5. Concatenation: perform concatenation.
The answer is 66."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: The given expression is ""5 + 3 # 2"" according to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), the first step would be to perform the prime factor counting operation:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Find the number of unique prime factors shared by |5| and |3|: prime factors of 5 are 5, prime factors of 3 are 2 and 3. Since there is no shared prime factor, the prime factor counting operation results in 0.

Next, we move on to the addition operation:

2. Addition (A): Since we already performed the operation with the highest precedence (prime factor counting), we can now evaluate the addition operation, which results in:

The answer is 5."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression 5 + 2 @ 4, we need to follow the revised order of operations in mathematics, which is now PEFMDASC.

1. Parentheses: None present, so we move on to the next operation.
2. Exponents: None present, so we move on to the next operation.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We do not have the absolute values of the given numbers, so we cannot perform the prime factor counting operation. The expression 5 + 2 @ 4 is made up of integers without any signs, so all numbers are considered positive.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): The concatenation operation (@) takes precedence over multiplication and division, so we cannot perform multiplication and division until after the concatenation operation is completed. Since there is no multiplication or division in the expression 5 + 2 @ 4, we move on to the next operation.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Addition has higher precedence than concatenation, but in this case, we already performed concatenation during prime factor counting since we had to find the absolute values of numbers to perform prime factor counting. Hence, 2 and 4 are concatenated, and the solution to concatenation operation is 24.
6. Concatenation (C): We already performed concatenation during step 4 since we had to find the absolute values of numbers for prime factor counting, which gave us the result of 24.

Now that we have performed all the necessary operations according to the revised order of operations (PEFMDASC), the final answer is: The answer is 24."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6, we need to follow the revised order of operations PEFMDASC.

First, we perform prime factor counting for each term:

1. For 8: Prime factors are 2, 2 and 2 (since 2^3 = 8), so # of unique prime factors is 1. How many? 1.
2. For 2: Prime factors are 2, so # of unique prime factors is 1. How many? 1.
3. For 6: Prime factors are 2 and 3, so # of unique prime factors is 2. How many? 2.
4. For 6: Prime factors are 2 and 3, again, so the count is still 2. But since this term is being repeated, we need to multiply the count by 2 because prime factor counting is only counted for each unique pair in the expression.

Now let's calculate:

1. Perform prime factor counting: 1 + 1 + 2*2 = 5
2. Follow the order: Neither term has an exponent, parentheses, or addition/subtraction, so neither term needs evaluation.
3. Multiple terms consisting of the same operation (#) sequentially, will have their results concatenated: 1 + 1(concatenated with) 2 = 12

The answer is 12."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression 4 # 3 + 2 following the newly updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to first perform the prime factor counting operation between 4 and 3. Since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3, we don't have any common prime factors. So the result of 4 # 3 is 0.

Then, we need to perform addition, which results in 0 + 2 = 2.

Therefore, the solution to the given expression 4 # 3 + 2 is 2.

The answer is 2."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem with the newly introduced mathematical operations and the updated order of operations, we need to follow the PEFMDASC rule. Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Parentheses: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses (14 + 4).
    = 18

2. Prime factor counting (#): Apply the prime factor counting operation.
    Since there is no direct common factor between 6 and 18, and neither of them is negative, 6 # 18 = 0.

3. Multiplication and Division (M/D): Since there is no multiplication or division involved in this case, we move on to the next operation.

4. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Since there are no parentheses left and there is an addition operation (+) between 6 and the result of the parentheses, we perform it now.
     = 6 @ 18

5. Concatenation (C): Apply the concatenation operation.
    = 618

So, the final answer is: The answer is 618."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: Given expression: 5 + 3 # 2

Following the revised order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to first evaluate the prime factor counting operation:

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
The prime factors of 2 are 2 itself, whereas the prime factors of 3 are 3 and prime factors of 2 are 2.
Since there are no shared prime factors (2 is a prime factor for 2, and 3 is a prime factor for 3), the prime factor counting operation results in 0.

Step 2: Addition and Subtraction (AS)
Since we have 0 and addition operation, the answer is 3 (adding 0 and 3).

Therefore, the answer is 3."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses, so we move on to the next operation.
2. Exponents: None in this problem, so we move on to the next operation.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): None in this problem, so we move on to the next operation.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): None in this problem, so we move on to the next operation.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We have the ""+"" sign for addition and ""@"" for concatenation. Since the addition sign comes before the concatenation symbol in the order of operations, we perform addition first.

Given expression: 5 + 2 @ 4

Solution:
1. Perform addition: 5 + 2 = 7.
2. Replace the + sign with the result (7) and separate the digits from the ""@"" symbol: 7 @ 4.
3. Perform concatenation: 7 @ 4 = 74.

The answer is 74."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem using the updated mathematical operations and order, we first need to apply the prime factor counting operation (#). We have:

8 # 2 = 2 (since the prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, there is only one 2 in common)
6 # 2 = 2 (similarly, prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, but there is only one common prime factor 2)

So, 8 # 2 + 6 # 2 = 2 + 2 = 4.

Now, we put the number 4 in the place of the original expression and apply the remaining operations following the new order of operations: PEFMDASC. Since there are no parentheses in our problem, we move on to the next operation, which is exponentiation (E). We don't have any exponents, so we proceed to the next operation, which is prime factor counting (F). We've already done this part in our first calculation, so let's move on to multiplication and division (M/D). We don't have any multiplication or division signs, so we proceed to the next operation, which is addition and subtraction (A/S). Finally, we apply concatenation (C). Since no numbers are being concatenated, the answer remains 4.

The answer is 4."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 4 # 3 + 2 according to the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to perform prime factor counting, which in this case is 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, and between 4 and 2. 

Next, we move on to addition and subtraction (A/S), so we calculate the sum of 4 and 2, which is 6. Therefore, the final answer without considering concatenation would be 6.

However, according to the updated mathematical operations and order, we need to perform concatenation (C) last. Since prime factor counting resulted in 0, so 4 # 3 = 0, and thus 4 concatenated with 3 is equal to 3, and 3 concatenated with 2 is 32.

So, following the updated order of operations, the final answer is: ""The answer is 32."""

1. Parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18
2. Concatenation: 6 @ 18
3. Prime Factor Counting: We don't have two numbers to find the common prime factors between them, so the result is 0.
4. Multiplication and Division (left to right): 0 # 3 = 0 (since we need to evaluate prime factorization before multiplication or division)
5. Addition and Subtraction (left to right): 6 @ 18 + 12 = 144

So, the answer is 144."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem with the new operations and order, we need to follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in this expression, so we skip this step.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this expression, so we move on to the next step.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): In this problem, we don't have any number with a negative sign, so we can ignore the prime factor counting step.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There is no multiplication or division in this expression, so we go to the next step.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Since we have an addition sign (+) and there is no subtraction sign, we will perform the addition first.

So, the given expression 5 + 3 # 2 decomposes to:

5 + 0 (since 3 and 2 don't have any common prime factors)

The answer is 5."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 2 @ 4 using the PEFMDASC order, follow these steps:

1. Identify and evaluate any operations within parentheses first (P): There are no parentheses in this expression, so we'll move on to the next step.
2. Calculate any exponents (E): There are no exponents in this expression, so we'll move on to the next step.
3. Perform prime factor counting (F) between the absolute values of the digits involved in the concatenation operation: In this case, there's no such operation taking place, as we only have addition and concatenation.
4. Perform multiplication and division (M/D) from left to right: There are no multiplication or division operations in the given expression.
5. Perform addition and subtraction (A/S) from left to right:

First, solve 5 and 2 (which are the addends) individually:
5
2

Since addition is from left to right (A/S), we can now perform the addition between the numbers we obtained earlier:

5 + 2 = 7

Now, having obtained the sum, we can move on to the only remaining operation – concatenation (C).

Since concatenation is also from left to right (C), we can perform the concatenation of the result of the addition (7) with the digit ""4"":

7 @ 4 = 74

The answer is 74."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the revised order of operations (PEFMDASC), follow these steps:

1. Prime factor counting (#):
   Calculate the prime factor count for each term:
   a. For 8: The prime factors of the absolute value of 8 are 2 and 2, with a count of 2. So, |8| # |8| = 2 # 2 = 2.
   b. For 2: The prime factors of the absolute value of 2 are 2, with a count of 1. So, |2| # |2| = 1 # 1 = 0.
   c. For 6: The prime factors of the absolute value of 6 are 2 and 3, with a count of 2 for 2 and 1 for 3. So, |6| # |6| = 2 # 2 # 1 # 1 = 2.

2. Multiplication and Division (M/D):
   Since there is no multiplication or division symbol present, skip this step.

3. Addition and Subtraction (A/S):
   The expression does not contain any addition or subtraction operations, so go to the next step.

4. Concatenation (C):
   Since both addition and concatenation are present, follow the order from left to right:
   a. Perform the prime factor count (#)operation for the terms outside the concatenation operation: 8 # 2 = 2 and 6 # 6 = 2.
   b. Concatenate the results: 2 @ 2 = 22.

The answer is 22."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the PEFMDASC order, we first focus on the new operations: prime factor counting (#) and concatenation (@).

Since prime factor counting comes before addition (A), we'll calculate 4 # 3 first:

1. The absolute values of the numbers to be compared: |4| = 4 and |3| = 3.
2. Find the unique prime factors of both numbers and count their occurrences:  Prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2. Prime factors of 3 are 3. Since there is no shared prime factor, the count is 0.

Now, the concatenation operation can be performed because it comes after addition (A):

1. Combine the digits of the absolute values of the numbers: 4 and 3. The result is 43.

So, the expression 4 # 3 + 2 evaluates as: 
0 + 2 (using the result of prime factor counting in the previous step)

= 2

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: Step 1: Solve the expression inside the parentheses, using PEMDASC as a guide:
Parentheses: (14 + 4)
 fusion: Let's evaluate this expression first as it is inside the parentheses:
 PE: No exponents are present
 F: No prime number factorization is involved
 M/D: Perform multiplication and division (but there are no multiplication or division operations)
 A/S: Perform addition and subtraction (from left to right)
 A: 14 + 4 = 18

Step 2: Perform the concatenation operation:
C: Concatenate the result of step 1 with the number 6:
6 @ 18 = 168

Step 3: Perform subtraction:
A/S: Perform the subtraction sign (from left to right):
 A: Subtracting the smaller number (2) from the larger number (168): 168 - 2 = 166

Step 4: Perform prime factor counting:
F: Count the unique prime factors shared between |166| and |3|: Since 166 does not share any unique prime factors with 3 (prime factors of 166 are 2, 2, 2, and 11, while prime factors of 3 are just 3), the result is 0.

Step 5: Combine the results from each step:
The answer is 0 @ 168 = 0168

   deriving prime factors for the absolute values of 3 and 2: 3 has prime factors 3, and 2 has prime factors 2.

2. Prime Factor Counting (#): Find the number of unique shared prime factors. In this case, there are none. So, 3 # 2 = 0.
