Let's evaluate the expression 5 + 3 # 2 using the PEFMDASC order of operations.\n\n1. First, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F), which is # in this expression. The operands are 3 and 2. The prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, # will result in 0.\n\nSo, 3 # 2 = 0.\n\n2. Next, we move to the addition operation (A), which is the first operation on the left of the expression after evaluating the prime factor counting operation in the previous step. The operands are 5 and 0 (from the previous step).\n\nSo, 5 + 0 = 5.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5.\n\nThe answer is 5. |\n| May 10, 2023, 03:11 PM\n Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Facebook\nUpdated Order of Operations with New Operations\n\nThe field of mathematics has evolved with the introduction of two new operations, concatenation (C) and prime factor counting (F), and as a result, the order of operations has been updated to PEFMDASC. This article presents examples that illustrate the application of these new operations and their placement in the revised order of operations.\n\nConcatenation (C)\nConcatenation is denoted by @ and represents the operation of joining the digits of two numbers together. When using concatenation, one does not consider the signs of the numbers involved, and instead focuses on the absolute values. Here are some examples:\n\n* If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.\n* If a = 12 and b = -56, then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.\n* If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.\n\nPrime Factor Counting (F)\nPrime Factor Counting is denoted by # and calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of two numbers. Here are some examples:\n\n* If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1, since the prime factors of 12 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 56 are 2 and 7, resulting in one shared prime factor, 2.\n* If a = -16 and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1, since the prime factors of 16 are 2 and the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 5, resulting in one shared prime"}]}]
