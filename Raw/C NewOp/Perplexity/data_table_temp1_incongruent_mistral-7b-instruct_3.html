Multiplication and Division (M/D): Since there are no multiplication or division operations in this expression, we'll move on to the next operation.<br><br>6. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We have an addition sign (+) between 5 and 2@4. Since the concatenation operation (@) has higher precedence than the addition operation (+), the concatenation, if present, should have been performed in step 1.
