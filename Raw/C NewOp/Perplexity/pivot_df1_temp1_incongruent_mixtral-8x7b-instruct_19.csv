The answer is 13."

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: Following the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to perform the prime factor counting operation before the addition operation.

First, find the prime factors of 4 and 3:

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
The prime factors of 3 are 3.

They share no prime factors in common, so 4 # 3 = 0.

Next, perform the addition operation:

0 (from the previous step) + 2 = 2.

Therefore, the answer is 2."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Following the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first evaluate the expression in the parentheses:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we perform the addition inside the parentheses:

6 @ 30 + 12 - 2 # 3

Now, we follow the order and perform concatenation:

306 + 12 - 2 # 3

Then, we do addition and subtraction from left to right:

318 - 2 # 3

316 # 3

Since 3 has only one prime factor (which is 3) and 3 has no shared prime factors with 3, the result of # operation is 0:

316 # 3 = 0

Finally, we have:

316 - 0

So,

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in this problem, so we move on to the next step.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this problem, so we move on to the next step.
3. Prime Factor Counting: We need to perform the # operation between 3 and 2. The prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. They don't share any prime factors, so 3 # 2 = 0.
4. Multiplication/Division: There are no multiplication or division operations in this problem, so we move on to the next step.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), which includes concatenation (C) as the last operation to be performed. Therefore, we first evaluate the expression within the parentheses, which is simply the number 2@4.

2@4 = 24 since the concatenation of the absolute values of 2 and 4 is 24.

Now, we substitute this value back into the original expression:

5 + 24

Since there are no more operations to perform, we can now evaluate the sum:

5 + 24 = 29

Therefore, the answer is 29."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the expression $8 \mathbin{\#} 2 + 6 \mathbin{\#} 6$ according to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to perform the prime factor counting (F) first, then addition (A).

First, calculate the prime factor counting of $8$ and $2$:
$8 = 2 \times 2 \times 2$, so the prime factors are $2$, with multiplicity $3$.
$2 = 2 \times 1$, so the prime factors are $2$ and $1$, with multiplicity $1$ and $1$ respectively.
Thus, $8 \mathbin{\#} 2 = 1$, since there is only one shared prime factor ($2$) between $8$ and $2$.

Next, calculate the prime factor counting of $6$ and $6$:
$6 = 2 \times 3$, so the prime factors are $2$ and $3$, with multiplicity $1$ for each.
$6 = 2 \times 3$, so the prime factors are $2$ and $3$, with multiplicity $1$ for each as well.
Thus, $6 \mathbin{\#} 6 = 2$, since there are two shared prime factors ($2$ and $3$) between $6$ and $6$.

Now, perform addition:
$1 + 2 = 3$.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{3}$."

Given expression: 5 + 3 # 2

First, calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) for 3 # 2:

3 # 2 = 1, as the only prime factor of 3 is 3, and the only prime factor of 2 is 2, and they share no prime factors.

Now, we have the expression 5 + 1.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations, which is PEFMDASC. In this case, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we can skip those steps.

The next operation is Prime Factor Counting (F). However, there is no prime factor counting operation in the given problem. So, we can move on to the next step in the order of operations, which is Multiplication and Division (M/D). Again, there are no multiplication or division operations in the given problem.

The next operation in the order is Addition and Subtraction (A/S). There is an addition operation, so we need to perform it.

The problem is: 5 + 2@4

Since concatenation is not a number, we cannot add it to 5. We need to perform the concatenation operation first before doing the addition.

The concatenation of 2 and 4 is 24, so we replace 2@4 with 24.

The problem becomes: 5 + 24

Now, we can perform the addition.
