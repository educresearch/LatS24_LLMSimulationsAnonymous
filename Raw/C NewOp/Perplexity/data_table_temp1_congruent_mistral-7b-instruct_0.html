      <td>GPT Response: To solve the given expression 8#2 + 6#6, we need to use the new order of operations PEFMDASC. Here's the step-by-step solution:<br><br>1. Prime factor counting (F): We first need to find the prime factor counts of 8 and 2, and 6 and 6.<br><br>   For 8 = 2³ &times; 2⁴, prime factors = { 2, 2, 2, 2 } = 4.<br>   For 2 = 2⁴, prime factors = { 2 } = 1.<br>   For 6 = 2² &times; 3², prime factors = { 2, 2, 3, 3 } = 4.<br>   For 6 = 6, prime factors = { 2, 3, 3 } = 3 (since 6 is already a prime number).<br><br>2. We have 1 shared prime factor between 8 and 2, which is 2. The prime factor count for 8 and 2 is 4 and 1, respectively. So 8#2 = 4.<br>Similarly, the prime factor count for 6 and 6 is 3 and 3, respectively. However, since there are no shared prime factors, the prime factor count operation gives 0.<br><br>3. Since the prime factor counting operation has higher precedence than addition according to the new order of operations, we get 0 + 6 = 6 as the sum of prime factor counts.<br><br>So, the given expression 8#2 + 6#6 evaluates to 0 (since the prime factor count operation for the second term is 0), and the final answer is:<br><br>The answer is 0.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve the problem 8#2 + 6#6 using the updated mathematical operations and order of operations, we first need to perform the prime factor counting (F) for each factor:<br><br>1. For 8: The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, so 8 has a prime factor count of 2.<br>2. For 2: Since 2 is already a prime number, it has a prime factor count of 1.<br>3. For 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, so 6 has a prime factor count of 2.<br><br>Now, we can perform the prime factor counting (F) operation: 2 (from 8) and 2 (from 6) share 2 prime factors, so the prime factor counting result is 2.<br><br>Next, according to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we should calculate the addition (A) operation before the concatenation (C) operation. In this case, since there are no multiplication or division operations involved, there's no need to follow a specific order aside from addition (A) before concatenation (C).<br><br>So, to calculate 8#2 + 6#6:<br><br>1. Perform Prime Factor Counting (F) operation: The result is 2.<br>2. Perform Addition (A) operation: 8 + 6 = 14.<br>3. Perform Concatenation (C) operation: Since there's only one digit for the result of the addition (A), there's no need for concatenation. The final answer is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
