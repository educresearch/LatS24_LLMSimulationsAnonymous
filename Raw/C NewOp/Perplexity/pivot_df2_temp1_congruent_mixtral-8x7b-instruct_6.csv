mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we start with the prime factor counting operation (F), thenmove to addition (A), and finally concatenation (C).

1. First, perform the prime factor counting operation (F) on 4 and 3:
4 # 3 = 2 (since 4 has the prime factors 2 and 2, 3 has the prime factor 3, and they share one prime factor, 2).

2. Then, perform addition (A) on 2 and 2:
2 + 2 = 4

3. In the end, since concatenation (C) comes last, concatenate the result with 0:
0 @ 4 = 04 = 4

Therefore, the answer is 4.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 according to the new order of operations, we first need to perform the prime factor counting (F) operation:

4 # 3 = 1 (since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3, so there is no shared prime factor)

Now, the expression becomes:

1 + 2

Next, we perform addition (A) from left to right:

1 + 2 = 3

So, the answer is:

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Following the new order of operations, we first perform prime factor counting (F), then addition (A).

4 # 3 + 2
= 1 + 2 (since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and the prime factors of 3 are 3, so 4 # 3 = 1)
= 3

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
First, we need to find the prime factors of the absolute values of 4 and 3.

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
The prime factors of 3 are 3.

Step 2: Count shared prime factors
Now, let's count the number of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 4 and 3. However, since 4 and 3 do not have any shared prime factors, the result of 4 # 3 is 0.

Step 3: Perform addition (after Prime Factor Counting)
Now, we will perform the addition operation, which is 0 (from 4 # 3) + 2.

So, the answer is 2.

The answer is 2."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: Following the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to perform the prime factor counting (F) before addition (A).

First, calculate the prime factor counting of 3 and 2:
3 # 2 = 0 (since 3 and 2 have no shared prime factors)

Then, perform the addition:
5 + 0 = 5

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F) inside the addition (A).

5 + (3 # 2)

Calculate the prime factors of 3 and 2:
Prime factors of 3 are 3 and prime factors of 2 are 2.
We see that there is only 1 shared prime factor, which is 1 (because every number has one as its factor). Thus, 3 # 2 = 1.

Now we go back to the addition:
5 + 1

Addition:
5 + 1 = 6

The answer is 6.","GPT Response: First, according to the updated order of operations, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) before the addition (A).

3#2 means counting the unique prime factors common to |3| and |2|. Since the only prime factor of 3 is 3 itself and the only prime factor of 2 is 2, they do not have any shared prime factor. Therefore, 3#2 = 0.

Now, we can proceed with the addition:

5 + 0 = 5

So,

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: Step 1: Evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation. 
5 + (3 # 2)
5 + (unique prime factors of 3 and 2)
5 + 1 (since the unique prime factors of 3 is 3 and of 2 is 2, and they have 1 shared prime factor 1)

Step 2: Evaluate the Addition (A) operation.
(5) + (1)
The answer is 6.

So, the answer is 6."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC). According to this order, we should perform addition before concatenation. Therefore, we first add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then, we concatenate 7 with 4.

So,

5 + 2 @ 4
= 7 @ 4
= 74

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations, we first evaluate the concatenation operation since it comes before addition in the order. So we compute 2 @ 4 = 24.

Then, the expression becomes 5 + 24. 

Lastly, we perform the addition operation to get the final answer:

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: First, we need to evaluate the concatenation operation, which is 2 @ 4 = 24.

Then, we need to evaluate the addition operation, which is 5 + 24 = 29.

So,

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: Step 1: Follow the order of operations and perform the concatenation first (C).
5 + 2 @ 4 = 5 + 24 (since 2 @ 4 = 24)

Step 2: Perform addition (A).
5 + 24 = 29

Therefore, the answer is 29."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: First, we need to follow the order of operations PEFMDASC. 

According to the order, we first need to perform the operation inside the parentheses:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

14 + 4 = 18, so we have

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we perform the Concatenation operation (C):

6 @ 18 = 618, so we have

618 + 12 - 2 # 3

Now, we perform the Addition and Subtraction operations (A and S) from left to right:

618 + 12 = 630, and then

630 - 2 = 628, so we have

628 # 3

Next, we perform the Prime Factor Counting operation (F):

The prime factors of 628 are 2, 157, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since there are no shared prime factors, we have

628 # 3 = 0

Therefore,

The answer is 0.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), where C (concatenation) is done last.

First, we evaluate the expression in the parentheses:

6 @ (14 + 4) = 6 @ 18

Next, we do the prime factor counting (F) operation:

6 # 18 = 2 (since the only shared prime factor is 2)

Finally, we do the subtraction (S) and addition (A) from left to right:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 = 618 + 12 - 2 = 630 - 2 = 628

So, the answer is 628.","GPT Response: Let's break down the problem using the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. First, we evaluate the expression in the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18.
2. Next, we apply the concatenation operation: 6 @ 18 = 618.
3. Now, we evaluate the subtraction: 12 - 2 = 10.
4. Then, we apply the prime factor counting operation: 10 # 3 = 1 (since 10 has prime factors 2 and 5, and 3 has no prime factors in common with 10).
5. Finally, we apply the concatenation operation (which is last due to the order of operations) to the results of steps 2 and 4: 618 # 1 = 0 (since 618 and 1 have no prime factors in common).

The answer is 0.","GPT Response: Let's tackle this problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. Parentheses: Calculate the expression inside the parentheses first, 14 + 4, since multiplication and addition are in the same level, we can solve from left to right.
Result: 18
2. Prime Factor counting (F): Identify the prime factors of 6, they are 2 and 3. But for this part of the operation, # 3, we don't need to calculate the prime factors of 3, as there's no shared prime factor between 6 and 3. The result is 0.
Result: 0
3. Concatenation (C): Perform the concatenation of 0 (from step 2) and 12, since subtraction is at the same level as concatenation in the order.
Result: 012 = 12
4. Subtraction: Perform the subtraction 12 - 2.
Result: 10
5. Multiplication: Perform the multiplication of 10 (from step 4) and the result from the prime factor counting in step 2, which was 0.
Result: 10 * 0 = 0

8 # 2 = 2 (since 8 has one prime factor 2 and 2 also has one prime factor 2, so they share 1 prime factor)

6 # 6 = 2 (since 6 has three prime factors 2, 3 and 3, and 6 also has three prime factors 2, 3 and 3, so they share 2 prime factors)

So, 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 2 + 2 = 4.

The answer is 4.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), which includes the new operations of prime factor counting (F) and concatenation (C).

8 # 2 = 1 (since the only prime factor of both 8 and 2 is 2 and it is shared once)

Next, we perform the prime factor counting operation (F) on the second part of the expression:

6 # 6 = 2 (since the only prime factor of both 6 and 6 is 2, and it is shared twice)

Finally, we perform addition (A) on the results of the prime factor counting operations:

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: For the expression 8#2 + 6#6, we need to follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), first evaluating Prime Factor Counting (F), followed by Addition (A).

8#2 = 3 (since the prime factors of 8 are 2*2*2 and for 2 it is just 2, and they share 2 prime factors)

6#6 = 1 (since the prime factors of 6 are 2*3, and for 6 it is just 2*3, and they share no prime factors)

Now, with the values from Prime Factor Counting (F), we continue to the Addition (A):

3 + 1

The answer is 4.","GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

   - Shared prime factors: 2
   - F = 1

2. Calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) for 6#6:
   - Prime factors of 6: 2, 3
   - Prime factors of 6: 2, 3
   - Shared prime factors: 2, 3
   - F = 2

3. Perform addition (A) after calculating the Prime Factor Counting (F) for both expressions:
