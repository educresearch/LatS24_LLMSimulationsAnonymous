In this case, we have 2 as the second operand for the # operation, but since both operands are positive, prime factors of 3 and 2 are 2 and 2 respectively. So, the prime factor counting operation yields a result of 2.\n\n Step 3: Perform Addition.\nNow we can perform the addition operation, but we have to be careful since the operands aren't directly addable due to the result of the prime factor counting. In this step, we are actually performing concatenation as the \"+\" sign is used to represent concatenation in this context. Since the result of the prime factor counting operation is a number with a value of 2, we can concatenate it to the number 5 by writing it as 5_ (an underscore is used here to represent the separation caused by performing prime factor counting before concatenation). Therefore, our current expression becomes 5_3.\n\nTo complete the concatenation operation, we need the second number, which in our case is 3. So, we'll proceed with 5_3 @ 3.\n\n Step 4: Perform Concatenation.\nThe concatenation of 5 and 3 results in the final answer:\nThe answer is: 53."}]}]
