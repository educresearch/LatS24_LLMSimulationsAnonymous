mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to perform prime factor counting:

1. Prime Factor Counting:
   For number 8: Prime factors are 2 (count = 3)
   For number 2: Prime factors are 2 (count = 1)
   For number 6: Prime factors are 2 and 3 (count = 2)

2. Prime factor counting is before addition, so we calculate the count of shared prime factors for 8 and 2, and 6 and 2:
   For 8 and 2: There is only one shared prime factor, 2. So, the count is 1.
   For 6 and 2: There is only one shared prime factor, 2. So, the count is 1.

3. Now, we can perform the addition:
   The result is the sum of the prime factor counting results, which is 1 + 1 = 2.

So, following the expanded order of operations, the step-by-step solution is:
1. Prime factor counting: 1 for 8 and 2, 1 for 2 and 6
2. Addition: 1 + 1 = 2

3. Prime Factor Counting: None in this given expression.
4. Multiplication and Division: None in this given expression.
5. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right): We have three operations in this category: @, +, and -.
6. Concatenation: We have two @ operations.

Let's now evaluate the given expression step by step according to the new order of operations:

1. Parentheses:

The given expression contains prime factor counting (#) operations before addition (+). According to the updated order of operations, prime factor counting should be performed before addition.

Hence, we will perform the prime factor counting operations first, individually for the terms 8#2 and 6#6.

For 8#2: The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2. Thus, the number of unique prime factors shared by 8 and 2 (which both have the absolute value of 1) is 0.

For 6#6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, while the prime factors of 6 are also 2 and 3. There are 2 shared prime factors, so the result will be 2.

Since we have performed prime factor counting before addition, the next operation to perform is addition.

Adding the results of 8#2 and 6#6:

0 + 2 = 2

So, the complete solution for the problem 8#2 + 6#6 is:

Perform the prime factor counting operations first:
0 for 8#2 and 2 for 6#6.
Add the results:
Result = 2.

2. Exponents: There are no exponent operations in this expression, so we can skip this step.
3. Prime Factor Counting: We don't have any numbers with negative signs, so there are no prime factorizations to do at this point.
4. Multiplication and Division (left to right): We see that there are no multiplication operations, so we can skip this step as well.

According to this order, we should first deal with parentheses and exponents if any exist, then prime factor counting, followed by multiplication and division from left to right, addition and subtraction from left to right, and finally concatenation.

In the given problem, there are no parentheses, exponents, prime factors, or any other advanced mathematical operations. However, there is concatenation. Since concatenation comes last in the order of operations, we can directly perform it:

5 + 2 @ 4 = 5 + 26 = 31

The answer is 31."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations: PEFMDASC. Since there are no parentheses or exponents, we begin with prime factor counting (F).

Prime factor counting:
For 8, the prime factors are 2 and 2. For 2, there is only one prime factor, 2, so 8 has a prime factor count of 2.

For 2, there is only one prime factor, 2, so the prime factor count is 1.

Now, we move on to multiplication and division (M/D). Since there is no division, we only consider multiplication. In this case, since there is no multiplication sign present, we assume multiplication is an implicit operation. In other words, we treat 8#2 and 6#6 as if they are written as 8#2 × 6#6.

Next, we perform concatenation (C), working left to right.

So, 8#2 + 6#6 = (8 × 2) # (6 × 6).

Given that 8#2 = 2 (prime factor count is 1) and 6#6 = 36 (prime factor count is 2), we can now concatenate their results:

Now, we can proceed with the remaining operations:

Addition (A) comes before Concatenation (C), so we first evaluate the addition:

4 # 3 + 2 = 4 + 3 = 7

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new operations and updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow the given steps:

Step 1: Parentheses
Inside the parentheses, we have 14 + 4, which is equal to 18. So, 6 @ (14 + 4) now becomes 6 @ 18.

Step 2: Concatenation (C)
Perform the concatenation, 6 @ 18 = 618.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Perform the prime factor counting between 6 and 3 is 0 since they don't have any common prime factors.

So, the problem becomes 618 # 0 + 12 - 2.

Step 4: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
We need to perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.

12 + (-2) = 10, so the problem now becomes 618 # 0 + 10.

Step 5: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Perform the prime factor counting between 618 and 0: Since 618 has prime factors (2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 7) and 0 doesn't have any prime factors, the result is 0.

However, since we can't perform an operation with 0 and this math problem seems to have an error, it would be best to consult the original problem's source to determine if there is a typo or mistake.

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Calculate the prime factor count for each term separately.
   - For 8#2: The absolute values are |8| = 8 and |2| = 2. Since 8 and 2 share the prime factor 2, the prime factor count is 1.
   - For 6#6: The absolute values are |6| = 6 and |6| = 6. Since both 6 and 6 share the prime factors 2 and 3, the prime factor count is 2.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the PEFMDASC order, we'll go step by step, focusing on the application of the new operations (concatenation and prime factor counting) and the updated order of operations:

Step 1: Parentheses
The parentheses contain the expression 14 + 4. Let's evaluate this expression first:

14 + 4 = 18

Step 2: Exponents (none present)

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (6 @ (18) and # 3)
Now let's calculate the prime factor counting for the given expressions:

For 6 @ (18): Since we cannot perform concatenation on an expression and a number, first we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses, i.e., 18. Since we already have the result from step 1, we have: 18
Now we perform concatenation on 6 and 18: 6 @ 18 = 618

For # 3: Since one of the numbers is 3, a prime number, the prime factor counting will be 1.

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (left to right)
Since there're no multiplication or division operations present, we move on to the next step.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
We now have three addition and/or subtraction operations to deal with: + and - in the problem and + after the concatenation result in the previous step. We'll perform these from left to right.

For the first addition: 618 + 12 = 630

For the last subtraction: 630 - 2 = 628

Step 6: Concatenation (left to right)
We only have one concatenation operation (630 @ 1), but since we've already evaluated it in step 3, the result is: 6301

However, since there's a prime factor counting operation (# 3) after the concatenation, we need to recalculate the result, applying prime factor counting after the concatenation:

Since the numbers to be concatenated are 630 and 1, let's calculate the prime factor counting for both numbers first:

For 630: Prime factors are 2 (three times), 3 (thirteen times), and 5 (two times).
For 1: Prime factor is 1. Since it's a single prime factor, the prime factor counting result is 1.

Now, applying the prime factor counting operation after concatenation: Since there's only one shared prime factor (1) between 630 and 1, the prime factor counting result is 0.

Since concatenation is the last operation and we've done it already, the result is the final answer:

The answer is 6301 (with a prime factor counting of 0).
