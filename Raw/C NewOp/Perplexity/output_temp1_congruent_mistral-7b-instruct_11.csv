1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in the given expression, so we move on to the next operation.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents in the given expression, so we move on to the next operation.
3. Prime Factor Counting: We cannot perform prime factor counting with just digits, as prime factor counting is defined for integers, not individual digits. So, we move on to the next operation.
4. Multiplication and Division: There is no multiplication or division in the given expression, so we move on to the next operation.
5. Addition and Subtraction (Left to Right): The expression contains only addition and concatenation. Since addition comes before concatenation in the new order of operations, we will perform the addition first.

systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first take care of the parentheses:

1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18.

Now we apply the new operations and their order:

2. Concatenation: Since there is no other operation apart from the concatenation symbol (@), we can directly evaluate it: 6 @ 18 = 618.

3. Prime Factor Counting (#): However, this operation is not involved in the problem, so its result is 0.

4. Addition: The next operation is addition (+). We have: 618 + 12.

5. Addition: Adding the numbers 618 and 12, we get: 630.

Now, we need to apply the final operation:

6. Subtraction: The last operation in the sequence is subtraction (-), but it's applied to the already calculated result (630) with the number 2: 630 - 2 = 628.

So, the solution to the problem 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3 is: The answer is 628."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)

                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

systemPrompt3_userPrompt2_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem following the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to perform prime factor counting:

1. Prime Factor Counting (8 and 2):
   Prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2 (twice), and prime factors of 2 are just 2. So, 8#2 equals the prime factor count of 2, which is 1.

2. Prime Factor Counting (6 and 6):
   Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 (twice), and prime factors of 6 are the same, so 6#6 equals the prime factor count of 2 and 3, which is 2.

Since the prime factor counting is done, we can proceed with the addition according to the new order of operations:

1. Addition and Subtraction (A/S):
   Now we can add the results of the prime factor counting operation: 1 + 2 = 3.

So, the solution to the given problem 8#2 + 6#6 is:

In this particular expression, the prime factor counting (F) operation should come before addition (A), so we will perform the prime factor counting first.

Given expression: 4 # 3 + 2

First, calculate the prime factor counting for 3 and 4:
- Prime factors of 3: 3
- Prime factors of 4: 2, 2

Since 3 has only one prime factor (3), and the prime factors of 4 (2, 2) have two occurrences in total, we have one prime factor (2) common between them. The prime factor counting (#) result is 1.

Now, let's follow the updated order of operations and perform addition (A) second:

systemPrompt3_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new mathematical operations and updated order of operations, we first need to identify which operations need to be performed.  ap Bast Eldentoe: 

In this problem, we have addition (A) and prime factor counting (F). According to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), prime factor counting (F) needs to be done before addition (A). So the correct sequence of operations is: 

F > A

Now, let's apply the operations:

We have the number 3 and need to perform prime factor counting (#) with 2:

The prime factors of 3 are 3, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since there is only one prime factor that is shared between 3 and 2, the prime factor counting result is 1.

Now that we have the result of the prime factor counting operation, we can perform the addition:

5 + 1 = 6

Therefore, with the updated order of operations, the solution to the problem 5 + 3#2 is:

The answer is 6."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt3_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To calculate the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the revised order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): To find the prime factor count between 4 and 3, we first need to find the prime factors for both numbers.
   Prime factors for 4: 2, 2
   Prime factors for 3: 3
   Since there are no common prime factors between 4 and 3, the prime factor count is 0.

2. Addition and Subtraction (AS): Perform the addition operation.
   0 (from prime factor count) + 2 = 2

3. Concatenation (C): Now, perform the concatenation operation.
   Since there's no operation before concatenation, we directly concatenate 2 and 4.
   The answer is 24.

So, the final answer is: The answer is 24."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)

1. Parentheses: Solve what is inside the parentheses first.
   14 + 4 = 18

2. Exponents: In this problem, there are no exponents, so we'll move on to the next operation.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F): 3 # 18
   1. Prime Factors of 3: 3
   2. Prime Factors of 18: 2, 2, 3, 3
   3. Shared Prime Factors: 2, 3
   4. Count of unique shared prime factors: 2

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): We don't have any multiplication or division operations in this problem, so we'll proceed with the next operation.

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): 

   a. First, we'll perform subtraction from left to right:
      12 - 2 = 10

   b. Next, we'll perform addition from left to right:
     6 @ (18 + 10)

6. Concatenation (C): Since there's an operation before concatenation, we need to perform that first, and then concatenate:
    The answer is: 6 @ (18 + 10).

    Given values: 6, 18, 4, 12, 2
    First, do the parentheses: 18 + 10 = 28
    Perform the prime factor counting: 3 # 28 = 1
    Since there's no multiplication or division, move to the next operation:

    Subtraction: 12 - 2 = 10
    Addition: 6 @ (18 + 10) = 6 @ 28 = 628
