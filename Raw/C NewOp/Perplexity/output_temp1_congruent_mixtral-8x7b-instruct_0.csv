1. Parentheses: Calculate the expression within the parentheses first.
  14 + 4 = 18
2. Prime Factor Counting (F): For this step, we count the number of shared prime factors between the numbers. However, since there are no numbers to be compared with the ""3"" at the end of the expression, we can skip this step for now and move to the next step.
3. Multiplication and Division (M and D): There are no multiplication or division operations in this expression, so we can skip this step as well.
4. Addition and Subtraction (A and S): Now, we are left with addition and subtraction operations. Let's do the addition first.
  6 @ 18 + 12 - 2
5. Concatenation (C): Perform the concatenation operation on the first two numbers now.
  618 @ 12 - 2
6. Concatenation (C): Perform the final concatenation.

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

So, first, we calculate 4 # 3, which is the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 4 and 3. The prime factors of 4 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since there are no shared prime factors between them, 4 # 3 = 0.

First, we find the prime factor counting for 8#2:

Prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2.
Prime factors of 2 are just 2.
Since they share one prime factor 2, 8#2 = 1.

Next, we find the prime factor counting for 6#6:

Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
Prime factors of 6 are just 2 and 3.

3#2 = 0, because the only prime factors of 3 are 3 and the only prime factor of 2 is 2. Since they have no common prime factors, the result of 3#2 is 0.

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

1. First, evaluate what' is inside the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18
2. Next, calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation: 6 @ 18 = 0 since 6 has the prime factors 2 and 3, and 18 has the prime factors 2, 3, and 3, with no shared prime factors. So, we concatenate 0 with the rest of the expression.
3. Evaluate the subtraction: 12 - 2 = 10
4. Finally, concatenate (C) the result from step 2 and step 3: 010

The answer is 010.

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:

                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
