mistral-7b-instruct,1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: Based on the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to evaluate prime factor counting before addition. In this case, the prime factor count of 4 and 3 is 0, since they do not share any prime factors. This means that the addition operation cannot be performed and the given expression is not valid under the new operations and order of operations. The expression ""4 # 3 + 2"" does not have a defined value using the given operations and the expanded order of operations.

Therefore, the final answer is undefined.","GPT Response: To solve the given expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the newly introduced mathematical operations and the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, follow the steps below:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Since there are no parentheses or exponents, we begin with prime factor counting for the concatenation operation. Based on the key examples, since 4 and 3 have distinct prime factors (2 and 2 for 4, and 3 for 3), the prime factor counting operation between them returns 0.
2. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Since addition is the next operation according to the new order, we proceed with evaluating the addition operation before concatenation. In this case, we have 2 as the result of the prime factor counting, and we need to add 3 to this result. Hence, the value of 2 + 3 is 5.
3. Concatenation (C): Now, since concatenation is the last operation to be carried out, we perform the operation 5 @ 3 as the final step. Given that the concatenation of digits 5 and 3 results in the number 53.

The answer is 53.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to evaluate prime factor counting (F) and then addition (A):

Given expression: 4 # 3 + 2

First, prime factor counting (F):

For number 4, the prime factors are 2 and 2.
For number 3, the prime factors are 3.
There is no common prime factor between 2 and 3, hence the prime factor counting is 0.

Now, addition (A):

4 + 2 = 6

Since there are no parentheses, exponents, or multiplication/division operations, we can skip those steps. Concatenation (C) comes last, so there's no need to apply it here.

Finally, with the prime factor counting (0) and addition (6) steps completed, the final answer is obtained:

The answer is 6.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), follow these steps:

1. Prime Factor counting (F): 
First, calculate the prime factor counting for 4 and 3. 
- Prime factors for 4: 2 x 2 x 2 = 4.
- Prime factors for 3: 3.

Since there is only one unique prime factor (2) in both sets, the prime factor counting for 4 and 3 is 1.

2. Multiplication and Division (M/D):
There is no multiplication or division in this expression, so we move on to the next operation.

3. Exponents (E):
There are no exponents in this expression, so we move on to the next operation.

4. Addition and Subtraction (A/S):
Next, we perform addition and subtraction. We are given 4 # 3 + 2. According to the PEFMDASC order, we must perform concatenation (C) before addition and subtraction (A/S), but since there is no addition or subtraction to perform yet, we move on to the next operation.

5. Concatenation (C):
Now, we perform the concatenation of 4 and 3. The expression 4 @ 3 results in 43.

6. Addition and Subtraction (A/S):
Finally, we are left with the expression 43 + 2. This is a simple addition problem. By performing it, we get:

43 + 2 = 45

The answer is 45."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: Given expression is 5 + 3#2. According to the new order of operations PEMDASC, we first need to perform the prime factor counting operation (F).

We know that prime factors of 3 are 3 itself and prime factors of 2 are 2. Since both 3 and 2 share the common prime factor 2, the prime factor counting operation results in 1.

Now we move on to addition (S) which is next in the order of operations.

The expression becomes 5 + 1 = 6.

So, The answer is 6.","GPT Response: To solve the given problem based on the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to first evaluate prime factor counting (F) for the number 3 and 2. Since 2 is a prime factor for both numbers, the prime factor counting (#) operation results in a count of 1.

Now, we can proceed with the addition (A) of the original numbers 5 and 3, with the prime factor counting result being 1 to get:

5 + 1 = 6

The prime factor counting operation did not affect the addition result here, as it only applies when dealing with the absolute values of the given numbers in the context of the concatenation operation.

Finally, the answer is:

The answer is 6.","GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations: PEFMDASC.

Since there are no parentheses, we’ll move on to the next operation. In this problem, we have the symbol #, which represents Prime Factor Counting. Before performing any other arithmetic operation, we need to calculate the prime factor counting.

Now, let's investigate the given numbers: 5, 3, and 2.

The prime factors of 5 are 5.
The prime factors of 3 are 3.
The prime factors of 2 are 2.

Since 3 and 5 only share one common prime factor, which is 1, the prime factor counting is:

5 # 3 # 2 = 0 # 3 # 2 = 0 # 2 = 0

Since the prime factor counting results in zero, we can now move on to the next operation in the updated order of operations, which is Multiplication and Division (M/D). However, there are no multiplication or division operations in this problem, so we'll slide over to Addition and Subtraction (A/S).

In this case, we have the addition sign (+) and the given numbers: 5 and 3. Since concatenation comes before addition, we need to evaluate the concatenation if present. But there is no @ symbol in this problem, so we can directly proceed to addition.

So, the calculation becomes: 5 + 3 = 8

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 8.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 3#2 using the PEFMDASC order, follow the steps below:

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (#)
First, we need to perform the prime factor counting operation between the absolute values of the given numbers. Let's find the prime factors of 2 and 3:

1. Prime factors of 2: 2
2. Prime factors of 3: 3

Since there is only one unique prime factor shared between the prime factors of 2 and 3, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 1.

Step 2: Addition (+)
Now, we move on to the next operation in our order, which is the addition operation. Since both 5 and 3 are single-digit numbers, we can calculate their sum directly. So,

5 + 3 = 8

However, we obtained this answer before performing the prime factor counting operation. To make it correct, we should have waited and included the result of the prime factor counting in this step instead:

5 + 3#2 = 5 + 1 = 6

So, the correct step-by-step calculation would be:

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (#)
Prime factors of 2: 2
Prime factors of 3: 3
Shared prime factors: 1
Result of # operation: 1

Step 2: Addition (+)
5 + 1 = 6

3. Prime Factor Counting: First, find the prime factors of all the numbers, 6, 18, and 3. Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, prime factors of 18 are 2 and 3, and prime factors of 3 are 3. Since there are no shared prime factors, the prime factor counting operation gives us 0.
4. Multiplication and Division: Neither of these operations appear in this expression.
5. Addition and Subtraction: Perform the addition inside the concatenation sign and then the subtraction: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 
6. Concatenation: Combine the digits of the first result and the second addend: 6 @ 30 = 630

2. Exponents: We don't have any exponents, so we move on to the next operation.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F): Since we don't have any numbers to perform prime factor counting (#) with, we move on to the next operation.

Step 2: Exponents
None present

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting
First, calculate the prime factor counts for absolute values:
6 @ 18 = 6 @ 2 * 3 * 3
But, prime factors cannot be counted in the product of two numbers more than once, so adjust the counting accordingly:
6 # 2 = 0 (no shared prime factors), 6 # 3 = 1 (prime factors: 2 and 3)
And, 6 # 3 * 3 = 3 (prime factors: 2 and 3)
So, the prime factors common to 6 and 18 are 2 and 3, so 6 # 18 = 2

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (left to right)
None present

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
First, do the subtraction:
12 - 2 = 10
Then, do the addition:

8 # 2 = 2 (since the prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and there is only one prime factor 2 shared with 2)
6 # 6 = 3 (since the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and there are two prime factors 2 and 3 shared)

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: To solve the given problem with the new mathematical operations and updated order of operations, let's break it down step by step:

1. Identify prime factor counting (F) operations: Here, we have # sign between the numbers 8 and 2, and the numbers 6 and 6.

2. Perform prime factor counting (F): For 8 and 2, the prime factors are 2 and 2 (since 2 is the only common prime factor, the prime factor counting value is 2). For 6 and 6, the prime factors are 2 and 2, 2 and 2 (four 2's in total). Since two 2's are shared, the prime factor counting value is 2.

3. Proceed with the updated order of operations: PEFMDASC:
  a. Since we didn't have any parentheses (P) in the expression, we'll move on to the next operation.
  b. We've already performed the F (prime factor counting) operation.
  c. Since there are neither exponents (E) nor concatenation (C) signs in our expression, we'll skip those operations as well.
  d. The next operations in the order are Multiplication and Division (M/D). However, there is no division sign present in our expression.
  e. So, we'll just evaluate Multiplication (M) relationships, which mean we need to multiply numbers that are adjacent to each other. Here, we have 8 and # sign, which represents prime factor counting result (2), and then 6 and # sign, which represents prime factor counting result (2). So, the multiplication operation would result in the following: 8 × 2 × 6 × 2, which results in 128. However, we didn't evaluate the addition (+) operation yet.
  f. The last operation in our updated order of operations is Addition and Subtraction (A/S), which requires us to evaluate addition before subtraction. So, we need to add 8#2 and 6#6:
    1. Due to the prime factor counting operations performed earlier, we have calculated the corresponding prime factor counting values, which are both 2.
    2. Now, since the order of operations demands we evaluate the addition first, we can just add the prime factor counting results:
       2 + 2 = 4.

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 128 + 4 = 132.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 8#2 + 6#6 using the revised order of operations (PEFMDASC), we follow these steps:

1. Perform prime factor counting for each term in the expression:

   - For 6#6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 x 2 x 3. The prime factors of 6 are also 2 x 2 x 3. So, the number of unique prime factors shared between 6 and 6 is 3. Hence, 6#6 = 3.
2. Add the results of prime factor counting:
