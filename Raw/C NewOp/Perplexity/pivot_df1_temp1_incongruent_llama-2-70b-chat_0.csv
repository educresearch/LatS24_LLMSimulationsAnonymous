llama-2-70b-chat,1,700,systemPrompt4,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: Sure! Here's the step-by-step explanation using the PEFMDASC order:

1. P: Parentheses

There are no parentheses in this expression, so we can proceed to the next step.

2. E: Exponents

There are no exponents in this expression, so we can proceed to the next step.

3. F: Prime Factor Counting

We need to find the prime factor count of the absolute values of 5 and 2.

5: 5 # 2 = 1 (since there is one shared prime factor, 5)

2: 2 # 4 = 0 (since there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 4)

So, the prime factor counting step is:
5 # 2 = 1

4. M/D: Multiplication and Division (left to right)

We need to evaluate 2@4.

2@4 = 2 Ã— 4 = 8

So, the multiplication step is:
8

5. A/S: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)

We need to add 5 and 8.

5 + 8 = 13

So, the addition step is:
13

6. C: Concatenation (left to right)

We need to concatenate 5 and 13.

5 @ 13 = 513

So, the concatenation step is:
513

The answer is 513.

Therefore, 5 + 2@4 = 513 using the PEFMDASC order."
