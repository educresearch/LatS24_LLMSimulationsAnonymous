Identify prime factor counting (F) operations: Here, we have # sign between the numbers 8 and 2, and the numbers 6 and 6.\n\n2. Perform prime factor counting (F): For 8 and 2, the prime factors are 2 and 2 (since 2 is the only common prime factor, the prime factor counting value is 2). For 6 and 6, the prime factors are 2 and 2, 2 and 2 (four 2's in total). Since two 2's are shared, the prime factor counting value is 2.\n\n3.

We've already performed the F (prime factor counting) operation.\n  c. Since there are neither exponents (E) nor concatenation (C) signs in our expression, we'll skip those operations as well.\n  d. The next operations in the order are Multiplication and Division (M/D). However, there is no division sign present in our expression.\n  e.
