Now, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting: 12 # 2 = 1<br>4. We add 1 to the result of step 3: 618 + 1 = 619<br>5.

      <td>GPT Response: The answer is 2.<br><br>Explanation:<br><br>1. First, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) from left to right.<br>8 # 2 = 4 (since the prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 1, and the prime factors of 2 are 2 and 1, so there are 4 shared prime factors)<br>6 # 6 = 1 (since the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, so there is only 1 shared prime factor)<br>2.

      <td>GPT Response: Sure, let's work through the problem together using the PEFMDASC order.<br><br>1. First, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation:<br>8 # 2 = 4<br>6 # 6 = 2<br>2. Next, we need to evaluate the addition (A) operation:<br>4 + 2 = 6<br>3. Now, we need to evaluate the concatenation (C) operation:<br>6 @ 6 = 36<br><br>The answer is 36.<br><br>Let's double-check our work using the traditional order of operations (PEMDAS):<br><br>1. First, we need to evaluate the parentheses (P) operation:<br>8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 8 # 2 + 6 # 6<br>2. Next, we need to evaluate the exponents (E) operation:<br>none<br>3. Then, we need to evaluate the multiplication and division (M/D) operations:<br>none<br>4. Next, we need to evaluate the addition and subtraction (A/S) operations:<br>8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 4 + 2 = 6<br>5. Finally, we need to evaluate the concatenation (C) operation:<br>6 @ 6 = 36<br><br>The answer is still 36.<br><br>It's important to note that the order of operations matters, and we need to follow the correct order to ensure accurate calculations. In this case, we used the PEFMDASC order to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation before the addition (A) operation, and then the concatenation (C) operation last.</td>
