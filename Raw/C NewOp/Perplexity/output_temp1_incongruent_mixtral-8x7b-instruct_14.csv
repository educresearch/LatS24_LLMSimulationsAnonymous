systemPrompt1_userPrompt1_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow the rules as given.

First, there are no parentheses or exponents in this expression, so we move to the next operation, which is prime factor counting. However, there are no numbers with absolute value greater than 1 in the expression 2@4, so we can skip prime factor counting for now and move to addition. 

Addition comes before concatenation, so we evaluate 5 + 2 first, which gives us 7.

Then we have 7 @ 4, which is the concatenation of the digits of 7 and 4. So, 7 @ 4 = 74.

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 74."

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

2 has only one prime factor, which is 2.

Then, count the shared unique prime factors between 5 and 3:
5 and 3 share no prime factors, so 5 # 3 = 0.

1. There are no Parentheses, Exponents, or Prime Factor Counting in the expression, so we move on to the next operation.
2. Multiplication and Division are also not present, so that leaves us with Addition and Concatenation.
3. According to the revised order of operations, we should perform Concatenation (C) before Addition (A).

So,

5 + 2@4
= 5 + 24 (since 2@4 = 24 due to the concatenation of 2 and 4)

Then, we can complete the addition operation.

14 + 4 = 18

Step 2: Now, we have the expression
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 3: Next, we perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation.
2 # 3 = 0 (since there are no shared prime factors)

Step 4: Now the expression becomes
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 5: Perform the Concatenation (C) operation.
6 @ 18 = 618

Step 6: Now, the expression becomes
618 + 12 - 0

Step 7: Perform Addition and Subtraction (A/S) from left to right.
618 + 12 = 630
630 - 0 = 630

The answer is 630."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. First, identify the operation that needs to be performed according to the order. In this case, there are no parentheses, exponents, prime factor counting, multiplication, or division. The first operation we encounter is addition. However, based on the new order of operations, we need to perform prime factor counting (F) before addition (A). So, we'll perform the prime factor counting operation.

5 # 2

To calculate this, find the prime factors of both numbers and count the shared prime factors:

Prime factors of 5: 5
Prime factors of 2: 2

Since there are no shared prime factors, the prime factor counting operation (F) will result in 0.

So, 5 # 2 = 0

2. Now, we can perform the addition operation:

5 + 3 # 2
5 + 3 (since 3 # 2 = 0)

3. Finally, add the numbers:

5 + 3 = 8

The answer is 8."
