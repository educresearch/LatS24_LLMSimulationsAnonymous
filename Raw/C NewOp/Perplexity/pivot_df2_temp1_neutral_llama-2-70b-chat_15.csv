Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: The answer is 9.

Explanation:

According to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to evaluate the concatenation operation (@) before the addition (+) operation.

First, we need to evaluate 2 @ 4 = 24 (using the new concatenation operation).

Then, we add 5 to 24 = 29.

Therefore, the final answer is 29.","GPT Response: Sure, I can help you with that! Here's the step-by-step explanation using the PEFMDASC order:

1. E: Exponents (none in this case)
2. F: Prime Factor counting (none in this case)
3. M/D: Multiplication and Division (left to right)
4. A/S: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
5. C: Concatenation (left to right)
