mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: Following the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first evaluate the prime factor counting operation. The prime factors of 4 are 2 and of 3 are none, so they share no prime factors and 4 # 3 = 0.

Then, we perform the addition operation, adding 0 (the result of 4 # 3) and 2.

The answer is 0 + 2, which is 2.","GPT Response: According to the new order of operations, we need to perform the prime factor counting (F) before the addition (A/S). So first, we find the prime factors of 4 and 3.

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
The prime factors of 3 are 3.

Since they share no common prime factors, 4 # 3 = 0.

Next, we perform the addition:
0 + 2 = 2.

Therefore, the answer is 2.","GPT Response: First, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation:

4 # 3 = 0 (since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3, so there are no shared prime factors)

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Let's break down the given expression using the revised order of operations PEFMDASC.

The expression is: 4 # 3 + 2

First, we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation:

4 # 3 = 0 (since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and of 3 is 3, so there are no shared prime factors, i.e. 0.)

Next, we perform the Addition (A) operation:

0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC). According to this order, we should perform the concatenation (C) operation after addition (A). So, we first evaluate the expression inside the concatenation operation.

2 @ 4 = 24

Now, our original expression reduces to:

5 + 24

Next, we perform the addition operation:

5 + 24 = 29

Therefore,

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 2@4, we need to follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC.

In this expression, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we move on to the next operation in the order, which is F for Prime Factor Counting. However, there is no prime factor counting operation in this expression, so we can skip it and move on to the next operation in the order, which is M/D for Multiplication and Division (left to right). But there are no multiplication or division operations in this expression either, so we can skip it as well.

The next operation in the order is A/S for Addition and Subtraction (left to right), which includes the addition operation in our expression. Therefore, we evaluate the addition first, yielding:

5 + 2@4 = 5 + 24 (since 2@4 = 24)

The result is now a simple number addition, and there are no more operations left to perform. Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC). According to this order, we need to perform concatenation (C) before addition (A).

First, concatenate 2 and 4:

2 @ 4 = 24

Then, add 5 to the result:

5 + 24 = 29

Therefore, the answer is 29. The answer is 29.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Let's break down the expression using the revised order of operations PEFMDASC.

The expression is: 5 + 2@4

Step 1: Parentheses ()
There are no parentheses in this expression, so we can move on to the next step.

Step 2: Exponents (to the power of)
There are no exponents in this expression, so we can move on to the next step.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Prime factor counting (denoted by #) is before addition in the order of operations, so we need to calculate any instances of it before adding. However, there is no prime factor counting in this expression.

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M and D) (left to right)
There are no multiplication or division in this expression.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A and S) (left to right)
Now we can move on to addition and subtraction. There is addition and concatenation in this expression, but since addition comes before concatenation in the order of operations, we should perform the addition first.

5 + 2@4
= 5 + (2 concatenated with 4)
= 5 + 24 (since 2@4 = 24, which is the concatenation of 2 and 4)

Step 6: Concatenation (C) (left to right)
There is only one instance of concatenation in this expression, which we performed in the previous step.

Therefore, the answer is:
