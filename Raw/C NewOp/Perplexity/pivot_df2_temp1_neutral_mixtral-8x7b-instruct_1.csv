mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the given order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F) for 4 and 3. The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factor of 3 is 3. Since there is no shared prime factor, 4 # 3 equals 0.

Now, we are left with 0 + 2.

Next, we perform addition (A) since it comes before concatenation (C) in the order of operations.

So, 0 + 2 equals 2.

Therefore, the answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2, we must follow the order of operations PEFMDASC. In this case, we first need to perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation:

4 # 3 = 1 (since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3, so they don't have any common prime factors, thus F(4,3) = 0).

So now, the expression becomes:

0 + 2

Now, we just need to perform the Addition (A) operation:

0 + 2 = 2

Therefore, the answer is:
