mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we follow the new order of operations PEFMDASC.

First, there are no parentheses or exponents in this problem, so we move on to the prime factor counting operation (F). However, neither 5 nor 2 have any shared prime factors (since neither is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself), so 5 # 2 = 0.

The problem now simplifies to:

5 + 2 @ 4

We calculate the concatenation of 2 and 4, which is 2 @ 4 = 24.

The problem now simplifies to:

5 + 24

Finally, we perform addition:

5 + 24 = 29

Therefore, the answer is 29."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC). According to this order, we first perform prime factor counting (F), then addition and subtraction (A or S), and concatenation (C) is the last operation.

So, for the expression 8#2 + 6#6, we first find the prime factor counting:

8#2 = 2 (since the prime factors of 8 are 2^3 and of 2 are 2, so they share 1 prime factor 2)

6#6 = 2 (since the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and of 6 are 2*3, so they share 2 prime factors 2 and 3)

Now we have the expression 2 + 2. We perform addition:

2 + 2 = 4

Finally, we do nothing more because concatenation (C) is not applicable here.

Therefore, the answer is 4."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC).

First, we do the prime factor counting operation (F) for 4 and 3:
4 # 3 = 1, since the only shared prime factor is 2 (prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and 3 has only one prime factor, which is 3).

Next, we have the addition operation (+):
1 (result from previous step) + 2 = 3.

The answer is 3."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: First, we need to follow the order of operations and evaluate the expression within the parentheses:

6 @ (18) + 12 - 2

Now, we perform the Concatenation operation (C), which is the last step in the new order of operations:

618 + 12 - 2

Next, we perform Addition and Subtraction (A and S) from left to right:

630 - 2 = 628

Finally, we perform the Prime Factor Counting operation (F):

628 # 3

However, since 3 is not a factor of 628, the result of the Prime Factor Counting operation is 0. So, the final answer is:

The answer is 0."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F) between 3 and 2:

3 # 2 = 0 (since the prime factors of 3 are 3, and the prime factors of 2 are 2, and they don't have any shared prime factors)

Next, we move to addition (A):

5 + 0 = 5

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), which includes parentheses, exponents, prime factor counting (F), multiplication and division (from left to right), addition and subtraction (from left to right), and concatenation (from left to right).

In this problem, we only have prime factor counting, addition, and concatenation. Therefore, we will perform prime factor counting first, followed by addition, and finally concatenation (since it is from left to right).

8 # 2 + 6 # 6

First, perform prime factor counting:

8 # 2 = 2 (since the only shared prime factor between 8 and 2 is 2 itself)
6 # 6 = 1 (since both 6 and 6 have the same prime factors: 2 and 3, but only one factor is considered for each number)

Now, we perform addition:

2 + 1 = 3

1. First, perform the operation inside the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18.
2. Next, do the concatenation: 6 @ 18 = 618.
3. Then, perform the other operations from left to right. There are no exponents or factor counting in this step, so we go to multiplication and division. However, there are no multiplication or division operations in this step.
4. Now, perform addition and subtraction from left to right. The first operation is subtraction: 12 - 2 = 10.
5. Lastly, do the prime factor counting: 618 # 3 = 0 because 618 and 3 have no shared prime factors.
