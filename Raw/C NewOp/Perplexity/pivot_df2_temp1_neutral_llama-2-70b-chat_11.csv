1. Prime Factor Counting: 4 # 3 = 1 (since there is only one shared prime factor, 2)
2. Addition: 4 # 3 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Using the new order of operations, PEFMDASC, we evaluate the expression as follows:

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) before the addition (A/S).

4 # 3 = 1 (since the shared prime factor between 4 and 3 is 1)

Then, we add 2 to get:

1 + 2 = 3

Therefore, the answer is 3.","GPT Response: Sure, let's work through the problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): 4 # 3 = 1 (since there is only one shared prime factor, 2)
2. Addition (A): 4 # 3 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3.

Here's a breakdown of how the operations were evaluated:

* First, we calculated the prime factor counting (F) between 4 and 3, which resulted in 1.
* Next, we added 2 to the result of the prime factor counting (A), which gave us 3.

It's important to note that in the PEFMDASC order, prime factor counting (F) comes before addition (A) and multiplication (M), so we need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation first."
