Since 0 doesn't have any addends, we can directly apply the prime factor counting operation between 6 and 6.\n   - For 6, primo factors are 2 and 3.\n   - For 6, primo factors are 2 and 3.\n   - Since prime factors 2 and 3 are being shared between 6 and 6, the prime factor counting operation result is 2.\n\nTherefore, based on the new updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), the solution to the given expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 is:\n\nFirst, we need to perform prime factor counting between 6 and 6 which gives us 2.\n\nThen, since there is an addition operation, we need to perform it before anything else. However, since one of the addends is 0, it doesn't add anything to the expression.
