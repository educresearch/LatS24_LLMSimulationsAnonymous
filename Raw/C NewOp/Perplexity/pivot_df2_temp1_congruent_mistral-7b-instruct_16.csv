mistral-7b-instruct,1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to identify which operations to perform:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): The given expression does not contain any multiplication or division, so the prime factor counting operation does not apply. The answer is 0.

Hence, without any calculations, the answer is:
The answer is 0.","GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to evaluate prime factor counting (F) before addition (A). Since 4 and 3 have no common prime factors (the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3), the prime factor counting operation (#) results in 0.

Therefore, the solution to 4 # 3 + 2 would be:

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve the problem 4 # 3 + 2 using the updated mathematical operations and order of operations, we first need to apply the prime factor counting (#) operation since it precedes addition (A) in the order of operations.

Step 1: Perform prime factor counting (#)
Since there are no common prime factors between 4 and 3, the prime factor counting operation results in 0.

Step 2: Perform addition (A)
Added the result of step 1 to 2 to obtain the final answer.

So, the solution is: 0 + 2 = 2

Therefore, The answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the PEFMDASC order, we need to follow these steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Find the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 4 and 3. Since prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and prime factors of 3 are 3, there is no shared prime factor. Therefore, the prime factor counting result is 0.

2. Addition and Subtraction (AS): Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses 3 + 2. The sum of 3 and 2 is 5.

3. Concatenation (C): Perform the concatenation operation between the result of the previous step and the number 4. Since we must perform concatenation after addition and subtraction, the result is 54.

So, following the PEFMDASC order, the expression 4 # 3 + 2 equals 54.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: According to the expanded order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to evaluate prime factor counting before addition. In this problem, we have 3#2.

Prime factor counting for 2 is 1, and prime factor counting for 3 is also 1. Since they have only one shared prime factor (which is 1 itself), the result of prime factor counting operation is 1.

So, the final answer for the given problem is:

The answer is 1.","GPT Response: To solve the given Mathematics problem with the newly introduced mathematical operations and updated order of operations, follow these steps:

1. Identify the mathematical operations in the expression and their priorities based on the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC):
   a) #: Prime factor counting
   b) +: Addition

2. Apply the operations in the correct order as per the updated order of operations:

3. Prime factor counting (#) comes before addition (+) in the updated order of operations. So, we apply prime factor counting to 3 and 2 first.

   The prime factorization of 3 is 3, and the prime factorization of 2 is 2. Since there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, the prime factor counting result is 0.

4. Now, we have 5 + 0. Since the '+' sign denotes addition, we perform the addition operation:

5. The answer is 5.

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: To solve the problem 5 + 3#2 using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we first focus on prime factor counting (#):

3 has prime factors 3 and 2, and 2 has prime factors 2. Both 3 and 2 share a common prime factor 2. So, the prime factor count of 3 and 2 is 1.

Now we apply the addition (A), however, since multiplication and division have a higher precedence than addition and subtraction, we cannot directly add 5 and 3#2. We need to move the prime factor counting inside the parenthesis, and rewrite the problem as:

5 + (3#2)

Now, using the Primate number property, since multiplication is applied before addition, we perform prime factor counting 3 and 2 first and get the result 1.

Therefore, the final answer is: The answer is 5+1 = 6.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 3#2 using the new PEFMDASC order, follow these steps:

1. Identify and apply prime factor counting (F): In this expression, we have the symbol # between two numbers (3 and 2). According to the PEFMDASC order, prime factor counting should be done before addition (A/S).

First, calculate the prime factor counts of both numbers, |3| and |2|. Since 3 is a prime number, its prime factor count is 1, and for 2 is also 1. So, 3#2 = 1 according to the key examples of prime factor counting (F).

2. Addition (A/S): With the prime factor counting out of the way, now we can perform the addition step: 5 + 1.

3. Perform the addition: 5 + 1 = 6

mistral-7b-instruct,1,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to identify which operations need to be performed first. In this case, there are no parentheses, exponents, or prime factor counting involved. Therefore, we move on to the next operations in order: multiplication and division (L to R), addition and subtraction (L to R), and concatenation (L to R).

Since addition and concatenation have the same precedence in this order of operations, we need to identify which operation should be performed first according to the associativity rules. In general, ""+"", ""-"", ""@"" are right-associative operators. This means that they should be applied from right to left, when they appear next to each other.

According to this rule, the infix expression ""5 + 2 @ 4"" should be rewritten as ""5 + (2 @ 4)"".

Now applying the new order of operations:

1. Addition: 5 + (2 @ 4)
2. Concatenation: 5 + (12)
3. Addition: 5 + 12

The answer is: The answer is 17.","GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations, we first need to evaluate the concatenation (C) operation since it is denoted before addition (A). So, the expression 5 + 2 @ 4 is equivalent to 5 + 2 @ 4 champions.

Since we have parentheses (P) in our order, let's put the expression inside the parentheses: (5 + 2) @ 4. Here, we need to evaluate the addition inside the parentheses first since it is before concatenation in the order of operations, so we have: 7 @ 4.

Now, we're left with the concatenation between the digits found in the absolute values of 7 and 4, i.e., 7 = 1 x 7 = 1, and the digits of 4 = 4. Thus, we have 1 @ 4 = 14 as our final answer.

The answer is: The answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve the problem 5 + 2 @ 4, we need to follow the updated order of operations: PEFMDASC. Since there are no parentheses or exponents, we start with the next operation: Concatenation (C).

1. Concatenation: 5 + 2 @ 4
2. Addition and Subtraction (AS): Since there is an addition symbol, we perform addition before concatenation:

Addition: 5 + 2 = 7
3. Concatenation: 7 @ 4

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 2 @ 4 using the PEFMDASC order, we follow the steps below:

3. Prime Factor Counting (F): Since there are no integers involved, we cannot perform prime factor counting at this step. Thus, we move to the next operation.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There is neither multiplication nor division in the expression, so we proceed to the next step.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We have an addition sign (+) between 5 and 2, and a concatenation operator (@) between the result and 4. Since concatenation (C) comes after addition and subtraction in the updated order, we first evaluate the addition.

5 + 2 = 7

Now, since the concatenation operator (@) comes after addition, we evaluate the concatenation equation as follows:

Step 2. Concatenation:
7 @ 4 = 74

Answer: 2.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated operations and order of operations, we first focus on prime factor counting (F). caused we need to identify the unique prime factors shared between the numbers. In this case, the prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since there is one common prime factor (2), the result of the prime factor counting operation is 1.

Now we move next in the order of operations which is Multiplication and Division (M/D), but since there are no multiplication or divisions in this expression, we move on to the next operation, i.e., Addition and Subtraction (A/S). Here we add the prime factor counting results of 8 and 6, giving us an answer of 1 + 1 = 2.

For term 1 (8 # 2):
- The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2. The count of unique prime factors shared between 8 and 2 is 1, since both have the prime factor 2.

For term 2 (6 # 6):
- The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 (twice). The count of unique prime factors shared between 6 and 6 is 1, since both have the prime factor 2.

2. Based on the result of the prime factor counting operation, since we have 1 shared unique prime factor, the prime factor counting result is 1.

3. Multiplication and Division (M/D): Neither of the terms has an exponent, so we move on to the next operation.

4. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Since we have addition and no subtraction, we evaluate from left to right.
However, in this case we actually have a new operation concatenation (C) after the addition.

5. Concatenation (C): The first term of the addition is 8#2, which equates to 1 due to the prime factor counting. The second term is 6#6, again equating to 1 due to prime factor counting. Since there is only 1 term for each addend, the concatenation operation results in a single 1.

Therefore, the final answer is:
