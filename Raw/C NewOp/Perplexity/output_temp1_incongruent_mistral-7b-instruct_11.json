Prime Factor Counting (F): We do not have enough information to determine the prime factors of the given numbers, so we move on to the next operation.\n4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): The given expression contains an infix operation \"@\" which represents concatenation, but it looks like an incorrect symbol for multiplication. To resolve this, we should assume it to be addition (\"+\") or subtraction (\"-\") instead, as per the traditional mathematical notation. However, since there is no apparent addend or subtrahend, we cannot definitively determine which operation it should be. Therefore, we cannot apply the multiplication and division operation, and we need to move on to the next operation.\n5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We are unable to determine whether it is an addition or subtraction operation based on the available information.

Concatenation is a binary operation and we require two operands to perform it. Let us assume that there was a missing \"at-sign\" between the numbers in the expression, such as \"5 @ 2 @ 4,\" and we should interpret \"2 @ 4\" as two separate operands to concatenate with \"5\" rather than an infix notation for multiplication or subtraction.
