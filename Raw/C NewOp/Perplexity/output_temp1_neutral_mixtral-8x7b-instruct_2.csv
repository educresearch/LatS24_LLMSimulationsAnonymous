2. Prime factor counting: Perform # operation.
   2 # 3 = 0 (since there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3)

3. Concatenation: Perform @ operation.
   6 @ 18 = 618

4. Subtraction: Perform the - operation.

                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)

                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F): Now, we perform the prime factor counting operation.
	12 - 2 = 2 (which is already a prime number) and 3 also is a prime number.
	Therefore, 2 # 3 = 0, since there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3.
4. Multiplication/Division (M/D): Next, we perform multiplication and division from left to right (however, there are no multiplication or division operations in this problem).
5. Addition/Subtraction (A/S): We perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:

1. Parentheses: Calculate the expression within the parentheses first.
   a = 14 + 4 = 18

2. Prime Factor Counting (F): We have an F operation ahead of addition, so we calculate the shared prime factors between a and 2.
   a = 18, b = 2
   The prime factors of 18 are 2 and 3^2, and the prime factors of 2 are just 2.
   a # b = 18 # 2 = 1 (only 1 shared prime factor 2)

3. Concatenation (C): We have a C operation after addition and before subtraction.
   6 @ a = 6 @ 18 = 618

4. Subtraction: We have to perform the subtraction now.
   618 - 2 = 616

5. Prime Factor Counting (F): We again have a F operation in our order of operations.
   a = 616, b = 3
   Prime factors of 616 are 2^5 and 7, and prime factors of 3 are just 3.
   a # b = 616 # 3 = 0 (no shared prime factors)

The answer is 616."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

2. Addition (A): Now, we move on to addition. We already have the result from step 1, which is 0. So there is nothing left to add at this point.
