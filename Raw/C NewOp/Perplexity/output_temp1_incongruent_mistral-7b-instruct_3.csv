systemPrompt1_userPrompt1_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to evaluate the concatenation operation (C). In our given problem, 2@4, we concatenate the digits of the numbers 2 and 4, results in 24. So, the expression now becomes 5 + 24.

However, since addition is the last operation in the updated order of operations, we cannot perform it yet. Instead, we should go back and evaluate the first operation, which is exponents (E), prime factor counting (F), or parentheses (P). There are no exponents, prime factors, or parentheses in this problem, so we cannot resort to these operations.

Therefore, the updated order of operations does not provide a solution for this expression, as evaluated additions come last, and there's an additional concatenation operation present.

In this specific problem, 5 + 2@4, the operations and order of operations cannot be applied according to the given rules, as concatenation cannot be performed before addition. Consequently, the problem cannot be solved using these rules. The answer is undefined in this scenario."

Let's break it down:

1. Parentheses: (14+4) = 18

Now we have 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3.

2. Prime factor counting: Since 6 and 18 have no common prime factors (prime factors of 6 are 2, 3, and 3, and prime factors of 18 are 2, 3, and 3), # will evaluate to 0.

Now we have 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0.

3. Concatenation: 6 @ 18 = 618.

Now we have 618 + 12.

4. Addition: 618 + 12 = 629.

                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)

                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)

The problem involves two concatenation operations (C) denoted by # symbols. Because these are dependent on the results of prime factor counting (F) and addition and subtraction (A/S), those operations need to be evaluated first.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Solve the prime factor counting (F) operations within the # symbols:

a. 8 # 2: Since there are no common prime factors between 8 and 2, the prime factor counting operation results in 0.

b. 6 # 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, but both 2 and 3 are present in 6 twice, so we count 2 as a shared prime factor, and the prime factor counting operation results in 2.

2. Solve the addition operation (+) before applying concatenation (C):

Now we have two numbers, one with a prime factor counting result of 0 (8 # 2) and another with a result of 2 (6 # 6). To solve the overall problem, we need to add these two results:

0 (from 8 # 2) + 2 (from 6 # 6) = 2.

So, now we have a final result of 2 that will be subjected to the concatenation operation.

3. Finally, apply the concatenation operation (C):

Since the final result is 2, we will concatenate it with the number we initially started with (8):

2 @ 8 = 28.

So, the solution to the given problem using the newly updated order of operations PEFMDASC is:

The answer is 28."

   For 18: Prime factors are 2, 2, 2, 3, 3. There are two 2s, one 3, and two 3s. So the result is 5.
   For -2: Prime factors for the absolute value are 2.

                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a@b, this operation merges the digits of |a| and |b|. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a@b = |a|@|b| = |12|@|-56| = 12@56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a@b = 0@24 = 024 = 24.
                    Please make sure you understand this properly; it's simple yet fundamental.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted as a#b, it counts the unique prime factors common to |a| and |b|. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

1. Prime factor counting (F): For finding prime factor counting (#), we need to consider the prime factors of 4 and 3 separately since there is no common prime factor.
   The prime factors of 4 are 2 x 2 x 2 x 1, and the prime factors of 3 are 3 x 1.

2. Since there is no common prime factor between 4 and 3, the prime factor counting is 0.

3. According to the updated order of operations, addition (A) comes before prime factor counting (F).

4. Since the prime factor counting is 0, the expression 4#3 evaluates to 0.

5. Now we get to the addition part (A).

systemPrompt3_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new mathematical operations and the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to identify which operations to perform first.

The given expression is 5 + 3 # 2

From the order of operations, we can see that prime factor counting (#) comes before addition (+), so we need to perform prime factor counting before addition.

Also, since there are no parentheses, we don't need to consider that operation first.

So, let's perform prime factor counting for the given numbers: 2 (from the number 2), and the unique prime factors of 5 and 3. Since the prime factors of 5 are 5 and 5, and the prime factors of 3 are 3 and 3, and we have only 1 common prime factor (3), the prime factor counting value is 1.

Now we have 5 + 3 # 2 = 5 + 3 * 1 * 2 = 5 + 3 * 2

Now we need to perform the multiplication (M) before addition (A):

5 + 3 * 2 = 5 + 6 = 11

So, the answer is: The answer is 11."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3, let's follow the stepped-up order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Parentheses: Solve the expression inside the parentheses:
  14 + 4 = 18

2. Exponents: No exponent term present (skip this step)

3. Prime factor counting:
   For 6: Prime factors are 2, 3.
   For 18: Prime factors are 2, 2, 3.
   Since 2 and 3 are the unique shared prime factors between the absolute values of 6 and 18, the prime factor count is 2.

4. Multiplication and Division (left to right):
   Multiply the results of the previous prime factor counting step (the prime factor count) and the result of the operation before the multiplication sign:
   2 * 18 = 36

5. Addition and Subtraction (left to right):
   Perform addition before subtraction:
   Starting from the leftmost term, we have 6 @ 18 + 12, so with the order of operations, we must first perform the concatenation operation on 6 and 18:
   The result of 6 @ 18 is 618
   Add 12 to the result: 618 + 12 = 629

6. Concatenation:
   Perform concatenation operation on the results of the previous addition operation and the number before the concatenation sign:
   629 (from the previous step) @ 2 = 6292

7. Subtraction:
   Perform the subtraction operation at the end:
   Starting from the rightmost term, we have 6292 - 3, so subtract 3 from 6292:
   6292 - 3 = 6289

The answer is 6289."
