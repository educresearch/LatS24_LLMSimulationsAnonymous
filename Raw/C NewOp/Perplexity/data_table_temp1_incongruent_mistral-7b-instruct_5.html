Prime factor counting (F): prime factor counting is not applicable as no absolute values are present in the problem, and we cannot perform prime factor counting on bases or variables.<br>3.

Prime Factor Counting (F): Since there are no concatenation or multiplication/division symbols in the expression, we can skip prime factor counting for now.<br>4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): In the expression, we have the digits 2 and 4 combined with the "at" symbol, which represents concatenation. However, the symbol preceding the concatenation isn't a multiplication or division symbol. Since concatenation takes precedence over addition and subtraction (as mentioned in the examples), we need to handle the concatenation before dealing with the addition. <br>5.

Prime Factor Counting (F): We cannot perform prime factor counting on numbers without calculating their absolute values, so we cannot apply it yet.<br><br>4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): Concatenation (@) is considered a separate operation and should be performed before multiplication and division. Therefore, we cannot apply M/D yet.<br><br>5. Concatenation (C): In this expression, there is no concatenation operation. We'll focus on 2@4 instead.
