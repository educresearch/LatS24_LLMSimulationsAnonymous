llama-2-70b-chat,1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations: PEFMDASC.

1. Parentheses: inside the parentheses we have 14 + 4 = 18
2. Exponents: none
3. Prime Factor Counting: none
4. Multiplication and Division (L to R): 6 @ 18 = 6 @ 18 = 108
