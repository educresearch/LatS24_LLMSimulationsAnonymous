1. Parentheses: there are no parentheses in this problem, so we can skip this step.
2. Exponents: there are no exponents in this problem, so we can skip this step.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): we need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation between 2 and 4. The prime factors of 2 are 2 and the prime factors of 4 are 2. Therefore, the prime factor counting operation between 2 and 4 is 1 (since there is one shared prime factor, 2).
4. Multiplication and Division (L to R): there are no multiplication or division operations in this problem, so we can skip this step.
5. Addition and Subtraction (L to R): we need to evaluate the addition operation between 5 and the result of the prime factor counting operation, which is 1. Therefore, the addition operation between 5 and 1 is 6.

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

First, we perform Prime Factor Counting (F) for the first part of the expression:
8 # 2 = 2 (since 8 has 2 as a prime factor and 2 also has 2 as a prime factor)

Next, we perform Prime Factor Counting (F) for the second part of the expression:
6 # 6 = 1 (since 6 has 2 and 3 as prime factors, and 6 has the same prime factors, but we only count the number of unique prime factors)

Now that we have the results from the Prime Factor Counting operation, we move to the Addition (A) part of the order of operations:

Since the prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2, there are no shared prime factors, so 3 # 2 = 0.

Now, we are left with the addition operation (A) between 5 and 0 (the result from the previous step).

So, 5 + 0 = 5.

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)

                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: Let's break down the expression using the revised order of operations PEFMDASC and the new mathematical operations Concatenation (C) and Prime Factor Counting (F).

The expression is: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses
Evaluate the expression within the parentheses first, which is (14 + 4).

14 + 4 = 18

So, the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Calculate the Prime Factor Counting of -2 and 3, denoted as 2 # 3.

The prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since they don't share any prime factors, the Prime Factor Counting result is 0.

So, the expression is now: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3: Concatenation (C)
Perform the Concatenation operation, which is to join the digits of the absolute values of 6 and 18, denoted as 6 @ 18.

6 @ 18 = 618

So, the expression becomes: 618 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right:

618 + 12 = 630
630 - 0 = 630

Therefore,

The answer is 630."
