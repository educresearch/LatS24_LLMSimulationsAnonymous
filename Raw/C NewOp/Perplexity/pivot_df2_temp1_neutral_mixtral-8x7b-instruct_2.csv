mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: Following the new order of operations, we first perform the prime factor counting operation (F) for 4 and 3. The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since there are no shared prime factors between them, 4 # 3 = 0.

Now, there is only the addition operation (A) left. So, we add 0 (the result of 4 # 3) and 2:

0 + 2 = 2

Therefore, the answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to perform the prime factor counting (F) operation, then addition (A).

4 # 3 = 2 (since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and the prime factors of 3 are 3, there is no shared prime factor, so the result is 0, but we need to add 2 since it's absolute value is 2).

So now our expression becomes: 2 + 2

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Following the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to evaluate the concatenation operation before the addition operation. So we first compute 2 @ 4, which is 24, then we add this result to 5. Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 5 + 24 = 29.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations, we need to follow the acronym PEFMDASC.

First, we evaluate what is inside the concatenation operation since it is the first operation in the order of operations that appears in this problem:

2 @ 4 = 24

Now, we can use the result to evaluate the addition:

5 + 24 = 29

Therefore,

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first evaluate the concatenation operation because it comes before addition in the order.

5 + 2 @ 4
= 5 + 24 (since 2 @ 4 = 24)

Next, we perform the addition operation:

= 29

So, the answer is:

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations, focusing on the new operations and their placement.

1. Identify the given mathematical expression: 5 + 2 @ 4
2. Follow the order of operations, starting with parentheses (which aren't present in this expression).
3. Move to exponents (which also aren't present in this expression).
4. Proceed to the next operation in the order, which is Prime Factor Counting (F):
   Since 2 and 4 have the prime factor 2, the prime factor counting of 2 @ 4 is 1.
   So, 2 @ 4 = 1.
5. Now the expression becomes: 5 + 1
6. Perform the remaining operations, which are Addition and Subtraction (A/S).
   Perform the addition: 5 + 1 = 6

The answer is 6."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: Following the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first perform prime factor counting (F), then addition (A).

5 + 3 # 2
= 5 + 1 (since the unique prime factor of 2 is 2, and the unique prime factor of 3 is 3, so there is 1 shared prime factor, 0, but we ignore it since it's not relevant to the result)

So, the answer is 6.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations, we first evaluate the prime factor counting operation between 3 and 2. Since the prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2, there are no shared prime factors, so 3 # 2 = 0.

The expression becomes:

5 + 0

Finally, we evaluate the addition operation to get:

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: First, according to the new order of operations, we need to perform prime factor counting (F) before addition (A). The number 3 has a prime factor of 3, and the number 2 has a prime factor of 2. Since they do not have any common prime factors, the prime factor counting operation results in 0.

5 + 0

Now, we perform addition (A):

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Let's solve this problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): There are no exponents or multiplication/division to evaluate first, so we start with the prime factor counting operation. The prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, the result of 3 # 2 is 0.
2. Addition (A): Now, we move on to addition. We already have the result from step 1, which is 0. So there is nothing left to add at this point.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: Let's break down the expression step by step according to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. Parentheses: Calculate the expression inside the parentheses first.
   (14 + 4) = 18

2. Prime factor counting: Perform # operation.
   2 # 3 = 0 (since there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3)

3. Concatenation: Perform @ operation.
   6 @ 18 = 618

4. Subtraction: Perform the - operation.
   618 - 0 = 618

5. Addition: Perform the + operation.
   The answer is 618.

Note: When performing the @ operation, no new shared prime factors are introduced, so we don't need to revisit the earlier steps.","GPT Response: Let's break down this problem step-by-step, following the new order of operations PEFMDASC.

1. Parentheses: Calculate the expression inside the parentheses first.
	14 + 4 = 18
2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this problem, so we can skip this step.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): Now, we perform the prime factor counting operation.
	12 - 2 = 2 (which is already a prime number) and 3 also is a prime number.
	Therefore, 2 # 3 = 0, since there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3.
4. Multiplication/Division (M/D): Next, we perform multiplication and division from left to right (however, there are no multiplication or division operations in this problem).
5. Addition/Subtraction (A/S): We perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.
	6 @ 18 = 6 @ (10 + 8)
	= 6 @ 10 @ 8 (because we have to concatenate left to right)
	= 6108
6. Concatenation (C): Finally, we perform the concatenation from left to right. However, in this problem, all the other operations have been performed, so no more concatenation is required.

So, The answer is **6108**.","GPT Response: Let's break down the problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC).

1. First, we evaluate what's inside the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18.
2. Next, we deal with the Concatenation (C) operation: 6 @ 18 = 618.
3. Following that, we move to Prime Factor Counting (F): 2 # 3 = 0 (since there's no shared prime factor between 2 and 3).
4. Finally, we process the Addition (A) and Subtraction (S) operations: 618 + 12 - 0 = **630**.

The answer is 630.","GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations with a focus on the new operations.

1. Parentheses: Calculate the expression within the parentheses first.
   a = 14 + 4 = 18

2. Prime Factor Counting (F): We have an F operation ahead of addition, so we calculate the shared prime factors between a and 2.
   a = 18, b = 2
   The prime factors of 18 are 2 and 3^2, and the prime factors of 2 are just 2.
   a # b = 18 # 2 = 1 (only 1 shared prime factor 2)

3. Concatenation (C): We have a C operation after addition and before subtraction.
   6 @ a = 6 @ 18 = 618

4. Subtraction: We have to perform the subtraction now.
   618 - 2 = 616

5. Prime Factor Counting (F): We again have a F operation in our order of operations.
   a = 616, b = 3
   Prime factors of 616 are 2^5 and 7, and prime factors of 3 are just 3.
   a # b = 616 # 3 = 0 (no shared prime factors)

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F) for both 8 and 2, and for 6 and 6.

The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Therefore, the shared prime factors between 8 and 2 are 2, so 8 # 2 = 1.

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 6 are all 6. Therefore, the shared prime factors between 6 and 6 are 2 and 3, so 6 # 6 = 2.

Next, we need to evaluate the addition operation (A). So we have:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 2

Finally, we have the addition of 1 and 2, which gives us:

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: To solve the expression $8 \#{2} + 6 \#{6}$, we first need to count the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of each number. The prime factorization of 8 is $2 \times 2 \times 2$, so it has 1 unique prime factor (2). The prime factorization of 6 is $2 \times 3$, so it has 1 unique prime factor (2, which is also the only shared prime factor with 8). Therefore, $8 \#{2} = 1$.

Next, we need to find the prime factorization of 6 and 6. Since 6 has already been prime factorized in the previous step, we know it has 1 unique prime factor (2). The prime factorization of 6 is $2 \times 3$, so it has 1 unique prime factor (2). Since both 6 and 6 share a prime factor of 2, we have $6 \#{6} = 1$.

$$8 \#{2} + 6 \#{6} = 1 + 1 = 2$$
