mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow the rules as given.

First, there are no parentheses or exponents in this expression, so we move to the next operation, which is prime factor counting. However, there are no numbers with absolute value greater than 1 in the expression 2@4, so we can skip prime factor counting for now and move to addition. 

Addition comes before concatenation, so we evaluate 5 + 2 first, which gives us 7.

Then we have 7 @ 4, which is the concatenation of the digits of 7 and 4. So, 7 @ 4 = 74.

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 74."

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: Following the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we start with the prime factor counting (F) operation. 

First, find the prime factors of the absolute values of the numbers:

5 has one prime factor, which is 5.
3 has two prime factors, which are 3 and itself (since 3 is a prime number).
2 has only one prime factor, which is 2.

Then, count the shared unique prime factors between 5 and 3:
5 and 3 share no prime factors, so 5 # 3 = 0.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: To solve the expression $6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2 \# 3$, we follow the order of operations PEFMDASC.

First, we evaluate the expression in the parentheses: $14+4=18$.

So, the expression becomes $6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 \# 3$.

Next, we do the prime factor counting operation: $2 \# 3 = 1$ since the only shared prime factor is $2$.

So, the expression becomes $6 @ 18 + 12 - 1$.

Then, we do the concatenation operation: $6 @ 18 = 618$.

So, the expression becomes $618 + 12 - 1$.

Next, we do addition and subtraction from left to right: $618 + 12 = 630$ and then $630 - 1 = 629$.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: First, we follow the order of operations PEFMDASC and start with the operation inside the parentheses:

6 @ (14 + 4) = 6 @ 18

Next, we apply the new concatenation operation:

6 @ 18 = 618

Then, we move to the subtraction:

618 + 12

We need to evaluate the subtraction before the addition, so we calculate the prime factor counting (F) operation:

2 # 3 = 1 (since the prime factors of 2 are 2 and those of 3 are 3)

Now we can complete the subtraction and addition:

618 + 12 - 1 = 629 - 1 = 628

The answer is 628."

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: Let's solve the problem using the revised order of operations (PEFMDASC) and the new mathematical operations Concatenation (C) and Prime Factor Counting (F):

1. There are no Parentheses, Exponents, or Prime Factor Counting in the expression, so we move on to the next operation.
2. Multiplication and Division are also not present, so that leaves us with Addition and Concatenation.
3. According to the revised order of operations, we should perform Concatenation (C) before Addition (A).

So,

5 + 2@4
= 5 + 24 (since 2@4 = 24 due to the concatenation of 2 and 4)

Then, we can complete the addition operation.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: Let's break down the given expression and solve it step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations with the new operations included.

The expression is: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Step 1: Perform Prime Factor Counting (F) operation.
Calculate the number of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of the numbers.

8 # 2 = 2 (prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2 and prime factors of 2 are 2; hence, 1 shared prime factor)
6 # 6 = 2 (prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3; hence, 1 shared prime factor)

So, the expression becomes: 2 + 2

Step 2: Perform Addition (A) operation.
Calculate the sum of the numbers obtained from the previous step.

2 + 2 = 4

Therefore, the answer is:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 3: Next, we perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation.
2 # 3 = 0 (since there are no shared prime factors)

Step 4: Now the expression becomes
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 5: Perform the Concatenation (C) operation.
6 @ 18 = 618

Step 6: Now, the expression becomes
618 + 12 - 0

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. First, identify the operation that needs to be performed according to the order. In this case, there are no parentheses, exponents, prime factor counting, multiplication, or division. The first operation we encounter is addition. However, based on the new order of operations, we need to perform prime factor counting (F) before addition (A). So, we'll perform the prime factor counting operation.

5 # 2

To calculate this, find the prime factors of both numbers and count the shared prime factors:

Prime factors of 5: 5
Prime factors of 2: 2

Since there are no shared prime factors, the prime factor counting operation (F) will result in 0.

So, 5 # 2 = 0

2. Now, we can perform the addition operation:

5 + 3 # 2
5 + 3 (since 3 # 2 = 0)

3. Finally, add the numbers:

5 + 3 = 8

The answer is 8."
