In this case, it's the concatenation operation. Since concatenation comes last in the expanded order of operations PEFMDASC, we simply perform the concatenation ofthe numbers at the digit level:

The answer is 27."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: Based on the updated order of operations, we need to evaluate prime factor counting before addition. Therefore, let's find the prime factor counting for each number first:

1. Prime factor counting for 8: Since 8 has prime factors 2 and 2, the number of unique prime factors shared by 8 with itself is 2. Learners may write this as 8 # 8 = 2.

2. Prime factor counting for 2: Since 2 only has the prime factor 2, the number of unique prime factors shared by 2 with itself is 1.

3. Prime factor counting for 6: Since 6 has prime factors 2 and 3, the number of unique prime factors shared by 6 with itself is 2.

Now, let's perform the addition:

2 (prime factors shared by 8 and itself) + 1 (prime factors shared by 2 and itself) + 2 (prime factors shared by 6 and itself) = 5.

So, the answer is:

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), follow these steps:

1. Parentheses: Solve the expression inside the parentheses, i.e., 14 + 4.
   14 + 4 = 18

2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this expression.

3. Prime Factor Counting: Since we have no common factors, the prime factor counting # operation results in 0 between each pair of numbers.

4. Multiplication and Division (L to R): There is no multiplication or division in this expression.

5. Addition and Subtraction (L to R): Addition: 6 @ 18

    Concatenation: 618

   Subtraction: 12 - 2 = 10

6. Concatenation (L to R): Since 10 is not a number with a leading digit, we concatenate it with the result of the addition step: 618 @ 10 = 61810.

Therefore, the final answer is: The answer is 61810."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: Following the expanded order of operations PEFMDASC, we first evaluate the prime factor counting operation:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): 
We need to find the unique prime factors shared by |5| and |3|, and by |5| and |2|.

For 5 and 3: Prime factors of 5 is 5, and prime factors of 3 is 2 and 3. Since 5 is not a shared prime factor, the count is 0.

For 5 and 2: Prime factors of 5 is 5, and prime factors of 2 is 2. Since 5 is a shared prime factor, the count is 1.

Given that the prime factor counting operation resulted in multiple values, we don't have a single value to add with the number 3. Therefore, the new operation ""5 + 3#2"" is not meaningfully defined according to the given rules.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we need to follow the new order of operations: PEFMDASC. However, in this problem, we don't have any parentheses or exponents. So, the order becomes FMDASC.

First, let's perform the prime factor counting operation:

8 # 2 = 2 (since 8 has prime factors 2, 2, 2, 2, and 2, and 2 is the only prime factor that is a factor of both 8 and 2)

6 # 6 = 3 (since 6 has prime factors 2 and 3, and 2 is a prime factor of both 6 and 6, but 3 is a prime factor of 6 that is not a prime factor of 6)

So, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 2 + 3 = 5.

5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression 4 # 3 + 2, we need to follow the revised order of operations PEFMDASC. Accordingly, we have:

1. Prime factor counting (F): We first need to find the prime factor counts of the individual numbers, 4, 3, and 2. 

- Prime factors of 4: 2 and 2 (since 4 = 2 Ã— 2)
- Prime factors of 3: 3
- Prime factors of 2: 1

Therefore, the number of unique primes shared between 4 and 3 is 1 (since only 2 is a common prime factor with both numbers). Now, let's calculate the prime factor count of 2: 1. So, 4 # 3 = 1.

2. Addition (A): Since we have performed prime factor counting before addition, we can now add 1 to the result of the prime factor counting operation, i.e., 1 + 1 = 2.

The expression 4 # 3 + 2 follows the order of operations PEFMDASC as follows:

1. Prime factor counting (F): 1
2. Addition (A): 1 + 1 = 2
3. Concatenation (C): Not applicable since the operands are both scalars.

Thus, the problem doesn't require concatenation to be performed. With that being said, the final answer following the newly updated order of operations is: The answer is 2."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: To solve the given Mathematics problem with the newly introduced mathematical operations and updated order of operations, follow these steps:

In this problem, we have addition (A) and prime factor counting (F).

Since prime factor counting (F) has higher priority than addition (A) as per the new order of operations, we need to perform prime factor counting first.

So, we need to find the prime factors of 3 and 2, which are 2 and 2, respectively. Since we have shared prime factors 2 in both numbers, the prime factor counting of 3 and 2 is 2.

Now, we need to perform the addition operation, so the final answer is:

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 8#2 + 6#6 using the updated mathematical operations and order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to perform prime factor counting between the given numbers.

Prime factor counting (#):
For number 8, the prime factors are 2 (2 times).
For number 2, the prime factor is already 2.

Since the prime factor 2 is common between both numbers, the prime factor counting result is 1.

Now, we need to apply the updated order of operations: PEFMDASC:

1. Parentheses: None in this problem.
2. Exponents: None in this problem.
3. Prime factor counting (F): We have already calculated the result (F = 1).
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There are no multiplication or division operations, so we move to the next step.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We have two addition operations: 8#2 and 6#6. Since we need to evaluate addition from left to right, we will first add 6#6, which is equal to 6 because prime factor counting of 6 is 0. Now, we add 8#2 to 6, which is equal to 8 because prime factor counting of 8 is 1. Since the result of 1 addition is the first addend, there is no carryover to the next digit, and we don't need to concatenate the digits.
6. Concatenation (C): None in this problem.

So, the solution to the problem 8#2 + 6#6 using the updated mathematical operations and order of operations (PEFMDASC) is 14 (one digit).

4 # (3 + 2)

   b. For 2: 2^1 (one 2 as prime factor)
   c. For 6: 2^2 * 3^1 (two 2s and one 3 as prime factors)

2. Prime factor counting (F) for addition:
   The prime factor counting of the numbers being added should be done separately in this step:

   a. The result of 8 # 2 = 0, since there are no shared prime factors between 8 and 2.
   b. The result of 6 # 6 = 2, because both numbers have the prime factor 2 in common.

3. Multiplication and Division (M/D):

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the PEFMDASC order of operations, follow the steps below:

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
First, perform the prime factor counting operation on the two numbers given, 3 and 4. The prime factors of 3 are 3, and the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2. Since there is no shared prime factor, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 0.

Since addition is before concatenation in the order of operations, we will now calculate the sum of 2 and the result of the prime factor counting operation (which is 0). Adding 0 and 2 results in a value of 2.

Step 3: Concatenation (C)
Now, we can perform the concatenation operation on the result of the addition (which is 2) and the number 4. Concatenating 2 and 4 results in the value 24.
