mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to first examine the given expression: 5 + 2 @ 4

The concatenation operation (C) involves joining the digits of two numbers. In this case, the concatenation is between the number 2 and the digits of the number 4.

First, since we're dealing with the digits of numbers, we need to apply the Concatenation operation before Addition. So, the expression changes to:

5 + 25 (since 2 @ 4 = 25)

Next, since Addition and Subtraction have the same precedence and are performed from left to right, we'll perform the Addition:

5 + 25 = 30.

The answer is 30."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to identify which operations belong to which category. In this expression, we have prime factor counting (#) and concatenation (@) operations.

Applying the new order of operations, we have:
1. Prime factor counting (#): It should be performed before concatenation (C).

So, we first evaluate the prime factor counting operations:
8 # 2 = 2 (They share only one prime factor 2.)
6 # 6 = 3 (They share three prime factors 2, 2, and 3.)

Now that we have the results, let's evaluate the concatenation operation:
Since we cannot concatenate two numbers directly with an operator in between, we should combine the results of the prime factor counting operations: 2 + 3 = 5.

Therefore, the final answer is: The answer is 5."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression 4 # 3 + 2 according to the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to perform the prime factor counting operation:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
   Since we are dealing with only small positive numbers, the prime factors of 4 and 3 are both 2 and 2. So, 4 # 3 = 2 (as there are 2 shared prime factors).

Next, we apply the addition operation:

2. Addition (A):
   Since addition takes place after prime factor counting, we can directly add the result of the prime factor counting operation (which is 2) and the number 2 given in the expression:
   The answer is 4.

So, the final answer is: The answer is 4."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow these steps:

1. Parentheses:
   = (14 + 4)
   = 18

2. Prime Factor Counting:
   = 6 @ 18 # 3

3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right):
   = (6 @ 18) # 3

4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right):
   = 114 # 3

5. Concatenation:

So, the solution to the given expression 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC) is:

The answer is 1146."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem with the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow the order as mentioned:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Since we have # operator, we need to find the number of unique prime factors shared by the numbers |5| and |3|. The prime factors of 5 are 5 and 1, while for 3, it's just 3. Since there's no shared prime factor, the result will be 0.

Therefore, the answer is:

0.

So our final answer is zero."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem with the newly introduced operations and the updated order of operations, we need to follow the PEFMDASC rule. In this case, we have addition (A), concatenation (C), and digit (no operation symbol given). Based on the order of operations, we perform the conccatenation before the addition.

Problem: 5 + 2 @ 4
Solution:

1. Evaluate concatenation (C): Since we have two numbers, '2' and '@' followed by '4', we perform the concatenation operation first.
   2 @ 4 = 24

2. Perform addition (A): Now, we add the numbers that were obtained after the concatenation operation.
   5 + 24 = 29

The answer is __.
Answer: 29."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to identify the prime factor counting (F) part of the expression, which are the numbers 8 and 2. We then perform the prime factor counting operation between them:

8 # 2 = 2 # 8 = 0 (since prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2, and 2, while prime factors of 2 are just 2. Since there are no shared prime factors, the result is 0.)

Now that we have processed the prime factor counting operation, we can move to the addition symbol (+). However, there are no numbers left for the addition operation except for 6 # 6.

Since we have reached the addition symbol, we must evaluate 6 # 6. The prime factor counting operation between 6 and 6 results in:

6 # 6 = 1

As a result, we have processed the entire expression using the new order of operations. The final answer is:

The answer is 0 + 1 = 1."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to perform prime factor counting (F). In this case, we have that 4 and 3 both share the prime factor 2, so 4 # 3 = 1.

Next, we perform addition (S). Since 1 + 2 equals 3, we have that 4 # 3 + 2 = 3 (when following the order of operations).

The answer is 3."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem with the new mathematical operations and updated order of operations, we need to follow the order PEFMDASC:

1. Parentheses:
   = (14 + 4)
   = 18
2. Exponents:
   = None
3. Prime Factor Counting:
   (a) For 6 @: The prime factors of |6| are 2 and 3, and for @ b = 18, the prime factors of |18| are 2, 2, and 3. Since they have only one shared prime factor '2', the prime factor counting is 1 (6 @ 18).

4. Multiplication and Division (left to right):
   = None
5. Addition and Subtraction (left to right):
   = 18 + 12
   = 30
6. Concatenation:
   = 3 @ 0

Given the order of operations above, the final answer:

The answer is 33.  (Note that '3' is the result from concatenating '3' and '0')"
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation. In this case, there is no multiplication or division involved, so we can directly say that 3 and 2 have no shared prime factors, i.e., 0. Then we need to perform addition. Adding the result of the prime factor counting operation (which is 0 in this case) to 5, we get the final answer:

The answer is 5."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations: PEFMDASC. In this case, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we start with Prime Factor Counting (F), Multiplication and Division (M/D), Addition and Subtraction (A/S), and lastly Concatenation (C).

Since there is no prime factor counting involved in this expression, we move to Multiplication and Division (M/D). However, there's no multiplication or division present in this expression, so we proceed to Addition and Subtraction (A/S).

We have the signs '+' and '@'. Since addition comes before concatenation, we combine the numbers and the '@' operator in this step:

5 + 2 @ 4
= 5 + 6 (since '2 @ 4' = 6 due to the concatenation operation)
= 11

So, the final answer in the required format is: ""The answer is 11.""

Therefore, the solution is 11."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 with the new operations and order of operations provided, we need to follow the PEFMDASC rule.

First, we perform prime factor counting:

- For 8: 2^3
- For 2: 2
- For 6: 2^2

Since 2 is the only common prime factor, the prime factor counting operation results in 1. Thus, 8 # 2 = 1 and 6 # 6 = 1.

Next, we perform addition using the result of the prime factor counting:

1 + 1 = 2

Now, according to the updated order, we have to perform concatenation:

Since 1 is a single digit, the result of concatenation is simply 1.

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 1."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 4 # 3 + 2, according to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to perform prime factor counting (F). select the digits 4 and 3:

4 = 2^2
3 = 3

No shared prime factors, so the result of 4 # 3 is 0.

Now, we can move on to addition (A/S). Add 0 and 2:

0 + 2 = 2

So, the answer is:

The answer is 2."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: To solve the problem with the new mathematical operations and updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), let's break it down step by step:

1. Parentheses: First, we perform the operation inside the parentheses:
   = 14 + 4
   = 18

2. Concatenation (C): Since we have an @ symbol after the result from step 1, we need to perform concatenation:
   = 6 @ 18
   = 618

3. Prime Factor Counting (F): There's a # symbol next to the result from the second step, so we need to perform prime factor counting:
   We find the unique prime factors of |618| = 2 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 2 * 3 * 3 and |3| = 3.
   Since there are no shared prime factors, the prime factor counting result is 0.

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There's no multiplication or division symbol in this example, so we move on to the next operation.

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Addition comes before subtraction, so we perform addition first:
   = 618 + 12
   = 629

So, the answer to the problem 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 is:

The answer is 629."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression using the newly introduced mathematical operations and the updated order of operations, we need to follow the PEFMDASC rule. In this expression, we have addition (A) and prime factor counting (F) operators. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Since we have prime factor counting (F) before addition (A), we first calculate the prime factor counting of 3 and 2.
2. The prime factors of 3 are 3 itself, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. We have one prime factor in common (2). So, 3 # 2 = 1.
3. Now, we return to the addition (A) operator and perform the addition of the given numbers: 5 + 1 = 6.

The answer is 6."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Step 1: Identify the operations in the expression and their order according to PEFMDASC:
1. Addition (A): 5 +
2. Concatenation (C): 2 @ 4

Step 2: Perform the operation inside the parentheses (if present): In this case, there are no parentheses.

Step 3: Handle exponents (E) and prime factor counting (F) if present: There are no exponents or prime factor counting operations in this expression.

Step 4: Perform multiplication and division (M/D) from left to right: No multiplication or division operations are present.

Step 5: Perform addition and subtraction (A/S) from left to right:
1. Perform addition: 5 +

Since 2 @ 4 is the next operation, we cannot perform this step yet. We will move on to the next operation after ""5 +"".

Step 6: Perform concatenation (C) from left to right:
1. Perform concatenation: 2 @ 4

Now that we have handled all operations, we can get the final answer:

The answer is: 5 + 25 (since we cannot concatenate the digits from '5' and '2' at this point, we need to perform the addition first).

To get the final result, follow these steps:
1. Add 2 to 5: 5 + 2 = 7,
2. Concatenate the result '7' with the digit '5': 7 @ 5 = 75.

So, the final answer is 75."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, follow these steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
   a. Calculate the prime factor count for the first pair: 8 # 2
       i. Prime factors of |8|: 2, 2, 2, 2
       ii. Prime factors of |2|: 2
       iii. There is only one prime factor 2 common between 8 and 2 so the count is 1.

   b. Now calculate the prime factor count for the second pair: 6 # 6
       i. Prime factors of |6|: 2, 3
       ii. Prime factors of |6|: 2, 3
       iii. There are two prime factors 2 and 3 common between 6 and 6 so the count is 2.

2. Multiplication and Division (M/D): We do not have any multiplication or division operation in the given expression.

3. Exponents (E): We do not have any exponent operation in the given expression.

4. Addition and Subtraction (A/S):
   a. Add the prime factor count results of the first and second pair: 1 + 2 = 3.

5. Concatenation (C): There is no concatenation operation in the given expression.

The answer is 3."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To calculate the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the PEFMDASC order, follow these steps:

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F):
Since there are no parentheses or exponent letters present, we proceed to the next operation, which is prime factor counting (#). However, in this case, we have only the concatenation (C) symbol and the addition (A) symbol, and no multiplication or division symbols. Concatenation does not affect prime factors since it simply joins the digits together, while addition does not change the prime factors of the given numbers. So, in this case, the prime factor counting (F) operation does not contribute to the calculation.

Step 2: Concatenation (C):
Now, we proceed to the next operation in the order, which is concatenation (C). In the given expression, we have 4 and 3 as inputs. Since concatenation is a left-to-right operation, we simply join the digits from the leftmost input to the rightmost input. In this case, we have:

4 # 3 = _

Since concatenation combines the digits of the numbers, the combined digits of 4 and 3 are: 43.

So, 4 # 3 = 43.

Step 3: Addition (A):
Next, we have the addition (A) operation. Add the digits in the concatenated result (43) one by one:

    4
+ 3
----
  7

The sum of 43 is 7.

So, 4 # 3 + 2 = 7.

The answer is 7."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 using the PEFMDASC order, follow these steps:

1. **Parentheses (P):** Solve the expression inside the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18
2. **Exponents (E):** No exponents are present in this expression.
3. **Prime Factor Counting (F):** Perform prime factor counting, but note that there aren't any negative numbers in this expression. However, we should follow the order, so:
   a. For 6: Prime factors are 2 and 3
   b. For 18: Prime factors are 2 and 2 and 3
4. **Multiplication and Division (M/D):** The only division is implicitly done when performing concatenation with negative numbers, but we will handle that at the concatenation step. For the current multiplication, there are no multiplication signs present in the expression.
5. **Addition and Subtraction (A/S):** Since addition binds more tightly than subtraction, we'll begin with adding the result of the parentheses, 18, to 6: 24
6. **Concatenation (C):** Now we perform concatenation: Since 6 and 24 are not negative, we can simply join the digits together: 624
7. **Subtraction (A/S):** The last operation is '-2': Since we've reached the end of the expressions, and we want to subtract 2 from the final result, we just change 624 to 622.

The answer is 622."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 3 # 2 using the PEFMDASC order, we need to follow these steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Our first step is to calculate the prime factor count of numbers involved in the expression, which is 3 and 2. Since there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, their prime factor count is 0.

2. Addition and Subtraction (AS): Since we are dealing with addition and no subtraction, we move on to the next step.

3. Concatenation (C): However, we need to evaluate concatenation before addition due to the updated order, so for demonstration purposes, let's calculate a potential concatenation that might be present if we had the numbers 5 and 3 swapped. Since 5 and 3 don't have a swap case here and concatenation results in zero (since there are no shared digits), we continue with the expression 3 # 2.

4. Multiplication and Division (MD): Since there are no multiplication or division operations in our expression, we move on to the next step.

5. Exponents (E): None present.

6. Parentheses (P): None present.

Considering the given expression 5 + 3 # 2, following the PEFMDASC order with the prime factorization already done, the steps are as follows:

1. Addition and Subtraction (AS): Add 3 to the result of the prime factor count of 2 which is 0.

2. Concatenation (C): We don't have any numbers to concatenate in this expression, so no action is required at this step.

According to the given expression and the PEFMDASC order, there are no multiplication, division, exponent, or parentheses operations, so no actions are required from those steps either.

The answer is 5 + 3 # 2 = 6."
