                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)

                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)

Next, we move on to multiplication and division (M/D), but there are no multiplication or division operations in the expression.

After that, we perform addition and subtraction (A/S). In this expression, there is an addition operation, so we evaluate it as follows:

3. Prime Factor Counting (F): Calculate the prime factor counting for the numbers that require it. In this case, we need it for 2 # 3. The prime factors of 2 are 2 and the prime factors of 3 are 3. However, there are no common prime factors, so the result of 2 # 3 is 0.

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.
                    It's crucial to get this right for accurate calculations.

                    = 4 * 5 @ 42  (we need to evaluate multiplication before concatenation
                    = 20 @ 42 = 2042. (concatenation is last)
                    
                    Negative Prompts:
                    * Do Not assume traditional order of operations (PEMDAS); use the updated PEFMDASC instead.
                    * Avoid skipping steps or assuming familiarity with the new operations.
                    * Do Not generalize or use examples not directly related to the given operations and expressions.

1. Parentheses: Calculate the value of (14 + 4) first.
14 + 4 = 18

So, the expression becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Prime Factor Counting (F): Since there is no prime factor counting in this expression, we can proceed to the next step.
3. Exponents: There are no exponents in this expression.
4. Multiplication and Division (M and D): There are no multiplication or division in this expression.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A and S): Perform the addition first.
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 30 - 2 # 3

Then, perform the subtraction.
6 @ 30 - 2 # 3
= 630 - 2 # 3

6. Concatenation (C): Perform the concatenation from left to right.
630 - 2 # 3
= 6303 - 2

7. The final answer is:
The answer is 6303 - 2.
