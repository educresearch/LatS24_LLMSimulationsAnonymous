mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow the rules step by step.

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in this problem, so we move to the next step.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this problem, so we move to the next step.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We count the number of unique prime factors shared by 2 and 4. Since 2 and 4 share one prime factor (which is 2), we have 1 as the result of this operation. However, based on the order of operations, we must wait to perform this step until addition is done.
4. Multiplication, Division: There are no multiplication or division operations in this problem, so we move to the next step.
5. Addition, Subtraction (A): We perform the addition operation first: 5 + 2. The result is 7.
6. Concatenation (C): We can now concatenate 7 with the result of the prime factor counting operation in step 3: 7 @ 1. The result is 71.

The answer is 71."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC). According to this order, we should perform Prime Factor counting (F) before Addition and Subtraction (A, S). So, we first calculate the value of 8 # 2 and 6 # 6, and then perform the addition.

8 # 2 = 4 (since the only prime factor of 8 is 2 and of 2 is also 2, so the unique shared prime factor is 2)

6 # 6 = 2 (since the only prime factor of 6 is 2 and 3, and of 6 is also 2 and 3, so the unique shared prime factors are 2 and 3)

Now, we substitute these values in the original expression and perform the addition:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 4 + 2 = 6

Therefore,
