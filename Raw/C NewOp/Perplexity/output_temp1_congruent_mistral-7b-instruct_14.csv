systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): We first perform the prime factor counting operation on the number 2. The prime factors of 2 are 2 itself.
2. Prime Factor Counting (F) for the expression '3#2': Since the prime factor counting operation is commutative and associative, we can apply it to each number separately and then compare their results to find the shared prime factors. The prime factors of 3 are 3, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, the prime factor counting operation results in 0.
3. Since the addition sign (+) is present between 5 and the result of the prime factor counting operation (3#2), we need to evaluate the addition before prime factor counting. Therefore, the addition sign (+) between 5 and 0 is evaluated as follows:
   5 + 0 = 5.

So, the solution to the given expression '5 + 3#2' is 5.

    A. The prime factor counting for 4: 4 = 2² × 2³
    B. The prime factor counting for 3: 3 = 3

2. Since there is no sharing of prime factors between 4 and 3, the prime factor counting operation for the given expression, 4 # 3, evaluates to 0.

3. Evaluate Addition and Subtraction (S): Since there is a '+' sign between 2 and the result of the prime factor counting operation (0), we need to perform the addition.

                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a@b = |a|@|b| = |12|@|-56| = 12@56 = 1256.

systemPrompt3_userPrompt2_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 8#2 + 6#6 with the new mathematical operations and order of operations, we first need to apply the prime factor counting operation between each pair of numbers:

1. 8#2:The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2, 2, which has a count of 5.
The prime factors of 2 are 2, with a count of 1. Since there is only one unique prime factor between 2 and 8, the result is 5.

2. 6#6: The prime factors of 6 are 2, 2, 3, which has a count of 3.
The prime factors of 6 are the same as 6 itself, so there are no unique prime factors common between 6 and 6, and the result is 0.

Now, we use the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC) to add the results of the prime factor counting step:

P: We don't have any parentheses in this problem
E: None, we haven't evaluated any exponents
F: 5 (result of 8#2)
M/D: 0 (result of 6#6)
A/S: We will add results of M/D operation
C: None

So, according to the order of operations PEFMDASC, we add the results of the multiplication and division step (M/D) which, in this case, is 0 and the result from the prime factor counting step (F) which is 5.

The answer is: 5."

Since there are no parentheses, exponents, or multiplication/division symbols, we start with prime factor counting:

   a = 4
   b = 3

   Prime factors of 4: 2, 2
   Prime factors of 3: 3

   There is only one unique shared prime factor, 2. Hence, the prime factor counting result is 1.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt3_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
First, we need to perform prime factor counting for the given numbers 4 and 3.

The prime factorization of 4 is 2 x 2 x 2 x 1 = 2^3. The prime factors of 3 are 3 and 1 from the given expression. Since there is no shared prime factor between 2^3 and 3, the result is 0 as per the definition.

Step 2: Addition and Subtraction (AS)
Since there is no addition sign before the concatenation operator (@), we presume there's an implicit addition sign before 4 which makes the given expression 4 + 3 or 3 + 4. We'll proceed with 3 + 4.

Step 3: Concatenation (C)
As per the order, we need to perform concatenation next. Since there's no operation to be performed on the numbers as such, let's just note down the sequence of numbers - 3 and 4.

Step 4: Addition and Subtraction (AS)
Now, we'll evaluate the addition part of our expression - 3 + 4 = 7

Step 5: Concatenation (C)
Finally, concatenate the result from step 4 with the original number 4. Concatenation of 7 and 4 yields 74 [Since addition comes before concatenation, we had 7 added to 4 not concatenated to form 74, and then concatenated]

The answer is 74."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

1. Parentheses:
   Solve the contents inside the parentheses first:
   14 + 4 = 18

2. Prime Factor Counting (None in this problem since we've already passed prime factors)
3. Exponentiation (None in this problem)
4. Multiplication and Division:
   We have no multiplication or division in this problem, so we move on to the next step.

5. Addition and Subtraction:
   In order, we will now solve the addition problem:
   We begin by doing the addition inside the expression, which is 6 @ 18:

   = 6 @ (14 + 4)
   = 6 @ 18

   Now we come back to 12 - 2:

   = 12 - 2
   = 10

6. Concatenation:
   Lastly, we perform the concatenation:

   = 114 + 10
