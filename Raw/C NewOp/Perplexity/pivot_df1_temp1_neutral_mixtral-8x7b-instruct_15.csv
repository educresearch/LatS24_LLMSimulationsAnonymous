mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC).

First, we perform the Prime Factor counting (F) operation:

8 # 2 = 0, since the prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2, and 2, and there are no shared prime factors with 2.

6 # 6 = 2, since the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, with 2 shared prime factors.

Now, the expression becomes 0 + 2.

0 + 2 = 2

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations, we start by performing the prime factor counting operation (F) since it comes before addition in the new order of operations.

First, we find the prime factors of 4 and 3:

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
The prime factors of 3 are 3.

We see that the only shared prime factor is 1 (since 1 is a factor of every number). Therefore, 4 # 3 = 1.

Next, we move on to addition (A):

1 (the result of 4 # 3) + 2 = 3

Therefore,

First, we perform Prime Factor counting (F) for the first part of the expression, 8 # 2:

The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, while the prime factors of 2 are just 2. Thus, they share one prime factor, which means 8 # 2 = 1.

Now, we perform Prime Factor counting (F) for the second part of the expression, 6 # 6:

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, while the prime factors of 6 are just 2, 3. Thus, they share two prime factors (2 and 3), which means 6 # 6 = 2.

The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 2 are just 2. Since they share one prime factor, 8 # 2 = 1.

Next, let's calculate 6 # 6:

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 6 are the same: 2 and 3. Since they share two prime factors (2 and 3), 6 # 6 = 2.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: Step 1: Calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) for the first pair of numbers, 8 and 2.
The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2.
The prime factors of 2 are 2.
There is a shared prime factor 2 repeated three times, so there is only 1 unique shared prime factor.
Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1.

Step 2: Perform the addition operation before moving on to the next Prime Factor Counting.
1 + 6 # 6

Step 3: Calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) for the second pair of numbers, 6 and 6.
The prime factors of 6 are 2, 3.
The prime factors of 6 are 2, 3.
There are 2 shared prime factors, 2 and 3.
Therefore, 6 # 6 = 2.

4 # 3 + 2

First, let's calculate the prime factor counting (F) operation, which is 4 # 3:

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Therefore, there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so 4 # 3 = 0.

So, our expression now becomes: 0 + 2

Next, we perform the addition (A) operation, which gives us:

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: Let's break down the expression using the revised order of operations, PEFMDASC.

The expression given to us is: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

First, let's handle what's in the parentheses:
(14 + 4) = 18

So, the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we handle Concatenation (C), which is denoted by @:
But we need to remember that Concatenation operates on two numbers without any consideration of their values e.g., 6 @ 18 becomes 618.

So, the expression becomes: 618 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we handle Prime Factor counting (F), which is denoted by #:
However, in this particular case, we can't perform the Prime Factor counting operation yet because we don't have any numbers that are either multiplied or divided together. We'll have to wait until we perform those operations.

The next operation in the order is Addition (A) and Subtraction (S):
618 + 12 = 630

So, the expression becomes: 630 - 2 # 3

Now, we can handle Subtraction (S):
630 - 2 = 628

And now, we have to satisfy the final operation, Prime Factor counting (F), with this new number:
The prime factors of 628 are 2 and 157 (no shared prime factors).
Therefore, 2 # 3 = 0 as per definition.

Finally, we have arrived at the answer:

The answer is 628."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: Step 1: Perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation.
First, find the prime factors of the absolute values of the numbers. The numbers are 5, 3, and 2.

5 has no unique prime factors (it is a prime number itself), so its count of unique prime factors is 0.
3 has one unique prime factor, which is 3 itself.
2 has one unique prime factor, which is 2.

Now, since there are no shared prime factors between 5 and 3, and none between 5 and 2, the result for the F operation is 0. But we have to compare this result with the other number 2, since we have the # operation between 3 and 2. So check for the shared prime factors between 3 and 2. They have no shared prime factors, so the result for the F operation is 0.

Step 2: Perform the addition operation (A).
Now, add the results from Step 1: 0 + 3 (which is just the number 3, since the F operation with 3 and 2 gave this result).

The answer is 3."
