mistral-7b-instruct,1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: According to the new order of operations PEFMDASC, the first step is to perform prime factor counting (F). In this case, the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since there is no shared prime factor between 4 and 3, the prime factor counting operation (#) results in 0.

The next step is to perform addition (A). Since there is no subtraction in the given expression, we go directly to addition. However, in this case, there is a prime factor counting operation (#) that came before the addition, so we have to adjust our steps accordingly.

Following the new order of operations, the next step is concatenation (C), which we can only apply after performing all addition and subtraction operations. However, in this case, there are no addition or subtraction operations remaining since we just completed prime factor counting. Therefore, since we cannot apply concatenation at this step, we move on to the next operation, which is multiplication and division (MD).

Since there is no multiplication or division in the given expression, we can skip this step and move on to the final step, which is addition (A).

Applying the addition operation to the prime factor counting result of 0, we get 0 as the final answer.

The answer is 0.","GPT Response: The given expression is ""4 # 3 + 2"". According to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to perform prime factor counting (F), then addition and subtraction (A/S), and finally concatenation (C).

Given expression: 4 # 3 + 2

First, we perform prime factor counting (F):
4 = 2^2
3 = 3
Since there is no common prime factor between 2 and 3, the result of prime factor counting operation is 0.

Next, we perform addition and subtraction (A/S):
We cannot directly add or concatenate the result of prime factor counting operation (0) and integers 3 and 2. Instead, we perform addition of 3 and 2, getting 5 as the result.

Finally, we perform concatenation (C):
Since we cannot concatenate results of different operations directly, we concatenate only numbers: 5.

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: Given problem: 4 # 3 + 2

Explanation:

According to the updated order of operations, the first operation to perform is Prime Factor Counting (F). In this problem, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we directly proceed to Prime Factor Counting.

Since there is no shared prime factor between 4 and 3, the prime factor count of 4 and 3 is 0.

Next comes Multiplication and Division (M/D), but since there is no multiplication or division sign, we move on to the next operation.

Addition and Subtraction (A/S). In this expression, there is an addition sign and two numbers, 4 and 3, to be added.

So, the solution would be: 4 + 3 = 7

Since there is no Concatenation (C) involved in this problem, we don't need to apply it.

Therefore, the final answer is: The answer is 7.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), follow these steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Calculate the prime factor count of the digits 4 and 3:
   Since prime factors for 4 is 2 and prime factors for 3 is 3, we don't have any shared prime factors between them. Thus, the prime factor count is 0.

2. Concatenation (C): Since we have the result of the prime factor counting operation, we can perform concatenation:
   0 @ 3 + 2

3. Addition (A): Do the addition before concatenation:
   0 + 3 = 3
   3 + 2 = 5

4. Concatenation (C): Perform concatenation on the results of the addition:
   3 @ 5 = 35

The answer is 35."

Step 1: Evaluate addition sign (from left to right):
We need to first add the numbers before the concatenation sign, i.e., 5 + 2 = 7.

Step 2: Perform Concatenation:
Since we have performed the addition sign, now we need to concatenate the numbers. In this case, we concatenate the digit ""7"" and the digits ""2"" and ""4"" of the number 7 @ 24.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, prime factor counting (F) should be performed before addition (A). In this problem, we have the number 3 sharing a common factor of 2 with the number 2 in the prime factor counting operation (# sign). Therefore, we need to find the prime factorization of both numbers first:

1. Prime factor counting: 3 = 3 (only prime factor: 3)
2. Prime factor counting: 2 = 2 (only prime factor: 2)

Since 3 and 2 share the common prime factor 2, their prime factor counting operation (#) is equal to 1.

The answer is 6.","GPT Response: According to the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to perform prime factor counting before addition. In this case, 3 shares no prime factors with 2, so their prime factor count is 0. Therefore, the problem becomes 5 + 0. The answer is 5.

3: Prime factors are 3
2: Prime factors are 2

We can see that 3 and 2 share one prime factor (2), so 3 # 2 = 1. Now we have 5 + 1.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem with the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to perform prime factor counting before addition:

1. Prime factor counting: 8 has prime factors 2 and 2, while 2 has only prime factor 2. Since both numbers have the same prime factor 2, the prime factor counting operation results in a count of 1.

2. Additionally, since the addition sign (+) is between the two concatenation operations (# and @), we need to perform addition before concatenation:

   The sum of prime factor counting result (1) and 6 # 6 is the final answer.

   So, the answer is _____________.

3. To find 6 # 6, we check the common prime factors: 6 has prime factors 2 and 3, while 6 also has prime factors 2 and 3. Since there are 2 prime factors (2 and 3) that are common to both numbers, the prime factor counting operation results in a count of 2.

4. Then, the addition of 1 (from the first step) and 2 (from the second step) gives the final answer:

The answer is _____________.

So, the final answer is 1 + 2 = 3. Therefore, the answer is ____________.

3. However, note that the given problem does not actually require the concatenation operation (@), as there is no @ sign present in the expression. Hence, a correct solution would be to only perform prime factor counting and addition:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6

2. For 6 # 6: Both 6 and 6 have the same prime factors, namely 2 and 3, which are repeated in each number, so the number of shared prime factors is 2.

   8 # 2 = 2
   6 # 6 = 2

Based on the updated order of operations, the Prime Factor Counting (#) operation should be performed before Addition (+), hence we should first perform the prime factor counting operations within the expression.

8 # 2 = 0, since there are no shared prime factors between 8 (prime factors: 2 and 2) and 2.
6 # 6 = 3, since common prime factors of 6 (prime factors: 2 and 2) and 6 are 2, so we have 2 as common prime factor three times.
