                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.

                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)

                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

First, let's calculate the Prime Factor Counting for the two operands on the left side of the expression, 8 and 2. 

The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 2 are just 2. Since they share one prime factor, 8 # 2 = 1.

Next, let's calculate the Prime Factor Counting for the two operands on the right side of the expression, 6 and 6.

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and again the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. These two numbers share two prime factors, so 6 # 6 = 2.

Now, we have 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 2, which is equal to 3.

The answer is 3."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

1. There are no parentheses or exponents, so we move on to Prime Factor counting (F). However, there are no instances of the prime factor counting operation (#) in the expression.

2. Next in line is Multiplication and Division (M/D), but there are no multiplication or division operations in the expression either.

3. We then come to Addition and Subtraction (A/S). We see here the addition operation (+): 5 + 3.

   Perform the addition: 5 + 3 = 8

   The expression now becomes: 8 # 2

4. Again, we look for the prime factor counting operation (#). It's present in the expression, so we perform it:

   Since the prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 2 are 2, there's one shared prime factor (2), so 8 # 2 = 1.

So, after performing all operations in the PEFMDASC order, we get:
