mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the problem with the new order of operations, we need to first evaluate what is inside the at symbol (concatenation) before addition. So, we have:

5 + 2 @ 4

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first focus on prime factor counting (F) and then addition (A).

Presenting the given expression as 8 # 2 + 6 # 6:

Since prime factor counting must be performed before addition, we calculate the prime factor counts of 8 and 2 separately:

1. Prime factor count of 8: 2³ * 2 * 7
2. Prime factor count of 2: 2

Since there's only one prime factor (2) that appears in both counts, we can now evaluate the prime factor counting operation:

8 # 2 = 1

Now, we can perform the addition:

Since the result of the prime factor counting operation is 1, the addition operation becomes 1 + 6 # 6.

We already calculated 6 # 6 = 0 in a provided example (the reason being no prime factors are common between 6 and 6, so the count is 0).

Now, the expression becomes 1 + 0 = 1.

Hence, the final answer is:

The answer is 1."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation. In this case, the prime factors of 4 and 3 are both 2, so they share one prime factor and thus # is equal to 1.

Next, we need to perform addition. So, 1 + 2 = 3.

Therefore, the answer is 3.

The answer is 3."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: According to the expanded order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to handle the parentheses:

(14 + 4) = 18

Now, the expression becomes:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we evaluate addition before concatenation:

6 @ 20 (since 18 + 12 = 20)

Then, we perform prime factor counting before subtraction:

6 # 20 = 2 (since 6 has prime factors 2 and 3, and 20 has prime factors 2 and 5. We only have 1 prime factor 2 in common, so the prime factor counting is 2.)

Now we can perform the remaining subtraction:

6 @ 20 - 2 = 620 - 2 = 619

Finally, we perform conccatenation:

619

So the answer is:

The answer is 619."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: The given problem is an arithmetic expression with addition and prime factor counting operation. According to the expanded order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation.

Performing the prime factor counting operation on the numbers 2 and 3, we have:
1. Determine the prime factors of each number: prime factors of 2 are 2, and prime factors of 3 are 3.
2. Count the shared prime factors: in this case, there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3, as their prime factor sets {2} and {3} have no common elements.
3. Therefore, the result of 2 # 3 is equal to 0.

Since we have evaluated the prime factor counting operation, we can now evaluate the addition operation:
1. Add 5 and the result of 3 # 2, which is 0

The answer is 5."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the given Mathematics problem with the new mathematical operations and updated order of operations, we follow the PEFMDASC rule:

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses, so we move on to the next step.
2. Exponents: None in the problem, so we move on to the next step.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): There is no need for prime factor counting in this problem, so we move on to the next step.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There is no multiplication or division sign in this problem, so we move on to the next step.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): The given problem consists only of addition and concatenation, so the addition operation should be executed before the concatenation operation according to the A/S order of operations.

First, let's perform the addition:

5 + 2 = 7

Now, let's apply the concatenation operation:

2. Prime factors for 8 are 2³ and 2². Thus, 8 has a total of 2 unique prime factors.
3. Prime factors for 6 are 2² and 3. Thus, 6 has a total of 2 unique prime factors.
4. Since both 8 and 6 have 2 unique prime factors each, the prime factor counting operation # results in 2.

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2
The prime factors of 3 are 3

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: To solve the given Mathematics problem using the newly introduced operations and updated order of operations, follow these steps:

1. Parentheses: Solve the expression inside the parentheses first.
   = 14 + 4 = 18

2. Concatenation (C): Perform the concatenation operation.
   = 6 @ 18

3. Prime Factor Counting (F): Perform the prime factor counting operation.
   Since we do not have the absolute values of the digits to determine the prime factors, we cannot perform prime factor counting at this stage. We need to finish all arithmetic operations and then determine the prime factors of the final answer.

4. Addition and Subtraction (AS): Perform addition and subtraction from left to right.
   = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2
   = 6 @ 30 - 2

5. Multiplication and Division (MD): Perform multiplication and division from left to right.
   It's not applicable in this case, as there are no multiplication or division operations.

Now, we cannot proceed with prime factor counting because we haven't calculated the final answer yet. After finding the final answer, we will determine the shared prime factors and output the prime factor count.

Final answer:
To find the prime factor count, we first need to find the answer to the given Mathematics problem:

The answer is __. (to be determined)
After finding the answer (which is 132), we can determine the prime factor count as follows:

= 132 # __ = __ (the prime factor count will be the result of powers of 2 and the count of other prime factors)
= 1 # 1 # 2 # 2 # 2 # 2 # 2 # 2 # 2 # 2 # 7 = 12

So, the prime factor count of the given expression is 12."

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in the given expressions, so we move on to the next operation.
2. Exponents: None present.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F):
   The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. They share one prime factor, 2, so the prime factor counting (#) operation results in 1.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): None present.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S):
   We have two expressions: 8 # 2 and 6 # 6. By the property of prime factor counting (#), we need to find the prime factors of each number and determine how many unique prime factors they share.

- For 2: prime factors are 2
- For 3: prime factors are 2 and 3
- For the concatenation of 2 and 3 (denoted as @): no shared prime factors, so the prime factor count is 0.

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Calculate the prime factor count for each pair of numbers.
   For 8 and 2: 8 # 2 = 2 (since 2 and 2 have the common prime factor 2)
   For 6 and 6: 6 # 6 = 2 (since both 6 and 6 have the common prime factor 2)"
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the PEFMDASC order, follow these steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): 
Calculate the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 4 and 3. Since prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and prime factors of 3 are 3, there is no shared prime factor. So, 4 # 3 = 0.

2. Concatenation (C):
Since we have the result of the prime factor counting operation, we can now perform the concatenation. Since 0 and any other number (in this case, 3) do not share any prime factors, the concatenation of 0 and 3 is just the number 3.

3. Addition (A):
Perform the addition operation with the outcome of the concatenation as the addends. Add 2 to the result obtained in the previous step (3):

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: Step 1: Since we have parentheses, we need to evaluate the expression inside first.

Expression inside parentheses: 14 + 4

Step 2: Perform addition: 18

Step 3: Now we have 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 4: Since we need to evaluate concatenation before anything else, let's do that first:

114 (18 @ 6 = 114, since 18 @ 6 = 186 and then we concatenate the ones place of both numbers)

Step 5: Now we have 114 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 6: Perform addition: 116

Step 7: Now we have 116 - 2 # 3

Step 8: First, let's calculate prime factor counting:

116 # 3 = 3 (since 3 is the only unique shared prime factor between 116 and 3)

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 3 # 2 using the PEFMDASC order, we first need to understand the meaning of each symbol:

1. The '+' symbol represents addition.
2. The '#' symbol represents Prime Factor Counting (F).
3. The '+' sign and the '3' and '2' are operands for the Prime Factor Counting operation (they are the two numbers being compared for shared prime factors).
4. The '5' is an operand for the addition operation.

Under the PEFMDASC order, we first perform Prime Factor Counting (F) on the operands 3 and 2:

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F):
Since both 3 and 2 are positive integers, their prime factors are all positive as well. From the key examples given, we see that prime factors for 2 are 2, and the prime factors for 3 are 3. As we discussed before, since there is no shared prime factor between these two numbers, their prime factor count is 0 (as in example (c)).

Step 2: Addition (A/S): Now that we have the Prime Factor Counting performed, we can move on to the addition operation: Add 5 to the result of the prime factor counting step.

Step 3: The answer is: 5 + 0 = 5.

Therefore, the answer to the expression 5 + 3 # 2, using the PEFMDASC order, is 5."
