mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: Following the order of operations PEFMDASC, we first evaluate the prime factor counting operation for 4 and 3. The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factor of 3 is 3. Since they don't have any common prime factors, 4 # 3 = 0.

Then, we do the addition operation with 0 and 2, so 0 + 2 equals 2.

Therefore, the answer is 2.","GPT Response: Let's evaluate the given expression using the new order of operations PEFMDASC.

4 # 3 + 2

First, we perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation:

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
The prime factors of 3 are 3.

There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so 4 # 3 = 0.

Now, we are left with the expression:

0 + 2

Lastly, we perform Addition (A):

0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC).

First, we perform the prime factor counting operation:
4 # 3 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor is 2)

Next, we do the addition:
1 + 2 = 3

So, the answer is:
The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Let's solve this problem step-by-step using the PEFMDASC order:

1. Prime Factor counting (F): There is only one prime factor for both 4 and 3, which is 2. So, 4 # 3 = 1.
2. Addition (A): Now we have 1 + 2.

The answer is 3."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve the expression `5 + 2@4` using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first evaluate the concatenation operation (C) since it comes last in the order:

2 @ 4 = 24

Now we are left with the expression `5 + 24`. According to the order of operations, we should perform addition (A) next:

5 + 24 = 29

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we start by performing the operation that falls under the ""F"" category, which is Prime Factor Counting. However, in this particular expression, there is no instance where two numbers with absolute values are next to each other. So we move on to the next operation in the order, which is addition.

The problem is: 5 + 2@4

So, first, we do the addition:

5 + (2@4) = 5 + 24 = 29

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC).

First, we evaluate the concatenation operation:

Now, we move to the addition operation:

5 + 24 = 29

So, the answer to this expression is:

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order:

1. Check for parentheses: There are no parentheses, so we proceed to the next step.
2. Check for exponents: There are no exponents, so we proceed to the next step.
3. Perform Prime Factor Counting (F): There are no prime factor counting operations in the expression, so we proceed to the next step.
4. Perform Multiplication and Division (M/D), from left to right: There are no multiplication or division operations in the expression, so we proceed to the next step.
5. Perform Addition and Subtraction (A/S), from left to right: We have an addition operation, so we start by evaluating that.

Step 5, Addition:
5 + 2@4
= 5 + 7 (since 2@4 = 24, and 24 in digits is 2 and 4, so concatenating 5 with 24 equals 5 and 24, which is 57)

So,
5 + 2@4 = 5 + 7 = 12

The answer is 12."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations, we need to do the prime factor counting (F) before the addition (A). So we first find the prime factors of 3 and 2, which are both 3 and 2, so they share one prime factor (2). Therefore, 3 # 2 = 1.

Now, we have the expression: 5 + 1

Finally, we do addition (A) to get the answer:
The answer is 6.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), which includes the two new mathematical operations Concatenation (C) and Prime Factor Counting (F).

Given expression: 5 + 3 # 2

First, we need to perform the Prime Factor Counting operation:
The prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. The only shared prime factor is none, so 3 # 2 = 0.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Let's go through the problem step by step, following the new order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. Parentheses: Calculate the expression within the parentheses first.
  14 + 4 = 18
2. Prime Factor counting (F): We cannot perform F at this stage as there are no numbers in the problem with shared prime factors.
3. Multiplication/Division (M/D): We cannot perform M/D at this stage as there are no multiplication or division operations yet.
4. Addition/Subtraction (A/S): We cannot perform A/S at this stage as there are still other operations (concatenation) with higher precedence.
5. Concatenation (C): Perform the concatenation operation now.
  6 @ 18 = 618
6. Addition/Subtraction (A/S): Perform the subtraction.
  618 + 12 - 2#3 = 618 + 12 - 2 (as 2#3 = 0, it does not affect the subtraction)

The answer is **638**.","GPT Response: Let's go through the problem step by step, following the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Parentheses: Calculate the expression within the parentheses first, which is 14 + 4.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this problem, so we can skip this step.
3. Prime Factor counting (F): Calculate any prime factor counting operations next. In our problem, we have 2 # 3. The prime factors of 2 are 2, and 3 has a prime factor of 3. Since they don't share any prime factors, the result is 0.
4. Multiplication and Division: There are no multiplication or division operations in this problem, so we can skip these steps.

Now, let's rewrite the problem using the results from each step:

6 @ 18 + 12

Next, perform concatenation (C) and prime factor counting (F):
6 @ 18 = 68 (since we need to evaluate concatenation before addition)
2#3 = 1 (since 2 is a prime factor of 2, but not of 3)

The expression now simplifies to:
