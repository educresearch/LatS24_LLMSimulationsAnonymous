mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations, we first apply the prime factor counting operation (F) to the numbers 8 and 2:

8 # 2 = 2 (since 8 has prime factors 2, 2, 2, and 2, and 2 has prime factors 2, so there is 1 shared prime factor 2)

Next, we apply the addition operation (A) to the result 2 and the number 6:

2 + 6 = 8

Now, we apply the prime factor counting operation (F) to the numbers 6 and 6:

6 # 6 = 2 (since 6 has prime factors 2 and 3, and 6 has prime factors 2 and 3, so there are 2 shared prime factors 2 and 3)

Lastly, we apply the addition operation (A) to the result 8 and the number 2:

8 + 2 = 10.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: Following the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first evaluate the prime factor counting operation. The prime factors of 4 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3, so they do not have any shared prime factors. Therefore, 4 # 3 = 0.

So, we have:

4 # 3 + 2
0 + 2

Sure! Let's break down the expression using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. Concatenation (C): Perform the concatenation operation first, which is 3 @ 5 = 35.
2. Prime Factor Counting (F): Next, do prime factor counting for 35 and 6. The prime factors of 35 are 5 and 7, and the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. They don't share any prime factors, so 35 # 6 = 0.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Let's break down the expression using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. Parentheses: Calculate the expression within the parentheses first, which is 14 + 4.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this expression.
3. Prime Factor counting (F): Perform the prime factor counting operation next. This occurs between 2 and 3 in the expression 2 # 3.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There are no multiplication or division operations in this expression.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Perform addition and subtraction, excluding the parts that involve concatenation (C). In this case, it would be 6 @ (14 + 4) and - 2 # 3. Thus, we first calculate 14 + 4, resulting in 18.
6. Concatenation (C): Perform concatenation on the remaining parts of the expressions, which are 6 @ 18 and 12 @ the result of 2 # 3. 

Now, let's follow the new order of operations step by step:

Step 1: Parentheses
No parentheses present in the expression, so nothing to do here. Move to the next operation.

Step 2: Exponents
No exponents present in the expression, so nothing to do here. Move to the next operation.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
No prime factor counting operation present in the expression, so nothing to do here. Move to the next operation.

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D) (left to right)
