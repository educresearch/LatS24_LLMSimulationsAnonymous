      <td>GPT Response: Sure! Here's the step-by-step explanation for the problem 4#3 + 2 using the PEFMDASC order:<br><br>1. First, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation: 4#3 = 4 # 3 = 1<br>2. Next, we need to evaluate the addition (A) operation: 4#3 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3<br><br>The answer is 3.<br><br>In this problem, we can see that the prime factor counting operation is evaluated first, since it is represented by the symbol #. Then, we evaluate the addition operation, which is represented by the symbol +. Finally, we concatenate the results of the prime factor counting and addition operations to get the final result, which is 3.<br><br>It's important to note that the order of operations is crucial in this problem, since evaluating the addition operation before the prime factor counting operation would give us a different result. For example, if we evaluate the addition operation first, we would get 4 + 2 = 6, and then we would evaluate the prime factor counting operation as 6 # 3 = 2, which would give us a final result of 2. However, this is not the correct order of operations, and we would get a wrong answer.<br><br>Therefore, it's important to follow the PEFMDASC order strictly, and evaluate the operations in the correct order to get the correct result.</td>
