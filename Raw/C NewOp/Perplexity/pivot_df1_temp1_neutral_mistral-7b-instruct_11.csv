mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem with the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to identify which operations need to be performed first. In this case, addition and concatenation have the same precedence, but they appear in different positions in the order of operations. According to the order of operations, we should perform concatenation before addition. Therefore, we will first concatenate the numbers 2 and 4, which results in 24. Next, we will add the number 5 to the concatenated number 24, giving us the final answer:

The answer is 5 + 24 = 29.

So the final solution is 29."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first perform the prime factor counting operation, then the concatenation operation.

Given expression: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

First, we find the prime factor count of each number:

1. For 8, its prime factors are 2, 2, 2, and 2. However, since we're counting unique prime factors, the prime factor count of 8 is 3.

2. For 2, its prime factor is just 2, and since it's already a unique prime factor, the prime factor count of 2 is 1.

So, the prime factor count operation results in: 3 + 1 = 4.

Now, we perform concatenation since it has a lower precedence than prime factor counting:

1. Since neither number is negative, we simply join the digits: 6 @ 6 = 66.

2. Since there are no prime factors involved in concatenation, the prime factor count is 0.

So, the concatenation operation results in: 4 + 0 = 4.

Hence, the final answer according to the newly updated order of operations is:

The answer is 4."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: Based on the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, the solution to the problem 4 # 3 + 2 would be as follows:

Since prime factor counting (F) is before addition (A), we need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation first. The prime factor count of 4 and 3 is 0, since there are no shared prime factors.

So, 4 # 3 = 0

Now, we can evaluate the addition operation. Adding the results of the prime factor counting operation (0) to 2 gives us the final answer:

The answer is 2."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to identify which operations to perform based on the priorities.

1. Parentheses: (14 + 4)
2. None in this case
3. Prime Factor Counting: # 3
4. Multiplication and Division: @
5. Addition and Subtraction: + and -
6. Concatenation: @

Now let's perform the operations in order:

Step 1: Parentheses
14 + 4 = 18

Step 2-3: Prime Factor Counting and Concatenation (since they share the same priority)
First, let's find the prime factors for each number:
- Prime factors for 6: 2, 3
- Prime factors for 18: 2, 2, 3

Now count the unique prime factors shared by 6 and 18:
# 3 = 2 (the shared prime factor)

Step 4-5: Multiplication and Division and Addition and Subtraction (since they share the same priority)
6 @ 18
= 654 (concatenating the prime factor count with the number 6)

Putting it all together, the answer is: The answer is 654."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: Based on the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F) before addition (S). Portion of the expression in the parentheses, 3 # 2, is evaluated as follows: since prime factors of 3 are 3 and prime factors of 2 are 2, there is only one shared prime factor, therefore the result is 1.

Now we return to the original expression: 5 + 3 # 2

Since the prime factor counting operation (F) was evaluated before addition (S), the expression becomes: 5 + 1 = 6.

The answer is 6."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematical expression with the newly introduced operations and updated order of operations, we need to follow the PEFMDASC rule. in this expression, the concatenation sign (+) is represented as @.

First, we identify any operations enclosed in parentheses (if present). In this given expression, there are no parentheses.

The next operations to be addressed are exponents (E). In this expression, there are no exponents.

The following operation is Prime Factor Counting (F). Here, there are no numbers with more than one prime factor to count.

Now, we look at Multiplication and Division (M/D), working from left to right. In this expression, there are no multiplication or division signs.

Next, we tackle Addition and Subtraction (A/S) from left to right. In this expression, there is only one addition sign, so we will address it now. However, we have encountered concatenation operation represented as @ sign before this addition sign.

Since the addition operation comes after concatenation in PEFMDASC rule, we need to first evaluate the concatenation:

5 + 2 @ 4 = 5 + 26 = 27

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 with the new mathematical operations and updated order of operations, we first need to apply the rules as follows:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
   - For 8, primo factors are 2³ and 2⁴ (since 2 is the only prime factor for 8).
   - For 2, prime factors are 2.
2. Since there is no prime factor sharing between 8 and 2, their prime factor counting operation is 0.
3. Addition and Subtraction (AS):
   - For 8 # 2, Prime factor counting is 0, so the result is 0 (since there is no sum or concatenation to perform).
   - Now for the remaining expression 0 + 6 # 6. Since 0 doesn't have any addends, we can directly apply the prime factor counting operation between 6 and 6.
   - For 6, primo factors are 2 and 3.
   - For 6, primo factors are 2 and 3.
   - Since prime factors 2 and 3 are being shared between 6 and 6, the prime factor counting operation result is 2.

Therefore, based on the new updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), the solution to the given expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 is:

First, we need to perform prime factor counting between 6 and 6 which gives us 2.

Then, since there is an addition operation, we need to perform it before anything else. However, since one of the addends is 0, it doesn't add anything to the expression. So the result is the value of the other addend which in our case is 6.

Finally, since there are no more operations left to perform, the answer is 6.

The answer is 6."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: Based on the newly updated order of operations PEFMDASC, the given expression 4 # 3 + 2 should be solved as follows:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Since the # symbol represents the prime factor counting operation, we first need to calculate the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of the given digits. In this case, the digits are 4, 3, and 2. However, since these are single-digit numbers, they all have only one prime factor, which is 2. Hence, 4 # 3 # 2 = 1.
2. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Since the addition symbol (+) is to the right of the '#' and 'C' symbols in the updated order of operations, we proceed to solve the addition after prime factor counting. 
   So, the given expression 4 # 3 + 2 becomes 1 + 2 = 3.

Therefore, the solution to the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the new mathematical operations and order of operations is: The answer is 3."

2. Concatenation (C):
   Perform the concatenation operation since it's the next operation in the updated order of operations:

In this problem, we have 3 numbers: 5, 3, and 2. Since 3 is the number being compared in prime factor counting with the other numbers, we need to find the prime factors of |3| which is simply 3. The prime factor counting operation does not result in any number since there are no shared prime factors between 5 and 3, or between 3 and 2.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem with the new mathematical operations and order of operations, we need to follow the updated order of PEFMDASC:

1. Prime Factor Counting (#): First, we calculate the prime factor counting for both numbers:
   8 = 2³ × 2⁴
   2 = 2⁴ (prime factors are 2)
   8 = 2³ × 2⁴ = 2³ × 2² × 2² × 2²

   6 = 2² × 3²
   2 = 2²
   6 = 2² × 3² = 2² × 3²

2. Multiplication and Division (MD): Since there are no multiplication or division operations in the input, we proceed to the next operation.

3. Addition and Subtraction (AS): We have two addition operations (8 # 2 and 6 # 6), so we evaluate them from left to right:

   a) 8 # 2 -> Prime Factor Counting: 8 = 2³ × 2⁴, 2 = 2⁴
     Since there is only one shared prime factor 2, the prime factor counting is 1.

   b) 6 # 6 -> Prime Factor Counting: 6 = 2² × 3², 6 = 2³ × 2³
     There are no shared prime factors between 6 and 6, so the prime factor counting is 0.

4. Concatenation (C): Since no concatenation operation was given in the input, we can ignore this step.

Therefore, following the updated order of operations, the solution is:

The answer is: 1."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: Given problem: 4 # 3 + 2

Explanation:
 based on the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to first apply prime factor counting (F) before any other operation. In this given problem, 4 and 3 are the operands for the concatenation (C) and addition (+) respectively. Let's look at the prime factors of 4 and 3:

* The prime factors of 4 are 2 X 2 X 2 X 1 = 2^3
* The prime factors of 3 are 3

Since 2 is a common prime factor in 2^3 and 3, the prime factor count (#) is 1.

Now we apply the 'addition' (A) operation, so:

4 # 3 + 2
= 1 (from the prime factor count) + 2
= 3

So, based on the updated order of operations PEMDFASC and the steps mentioned above, the answer is:

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses, so we move on to the next operation.
2. Exponents: None present, so we move on.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): In this equation, there are no multiplication or division signs, so we apply the prime factor counting operation (#) instead. We have two numbers, 5 and 3, and we need to find their unique prime factors:
   Prime factors of 5 = 5
   Prime factors of 3 = 3
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): Since there is no multiplication or division in this equation, we move on.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): In this equation, we have an addition sign (+) and an operation # (prime factor counting), but since the order of operations states that we need to do addition before prime factor counting, we can proceed with the addition: 5 + 3 = 8.
6. Concatenation (C): There's no concatenation sign (@) in the equation, so the final answer is 8.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Step 1: Identify and apply parentheses, if present. In this problem, there are no parentheses. So, we skip this step.

Step 2: Perform exponentiation, if present. In this problem, there are no exponents. So, we skip this step.

Step 4: Perform multiplication and division in the order they appear from left to right (MD). In this problem, there is only one multiplication operation, between '+' and '@' symbols.

5 + 2 @ 4

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: Step 1: Primence Factor Counting (F)
First, let's find the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 8 and 2, and between 6 and 6.

For 8 and 2, the prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2 and 2 and 2 (since 8 = 2 ^ 3). Prime factors of 2 are 2. So, the count of unique prime factors shared between 8 and 2 is 1.

Similarly, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 2 and 3, and since 6 = 2 ^ 2 * 3, there is only the prime factor 2 shared between 6 and itself.

Now, we move on to the next operation in the order of operations, which is...

Step 2: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
Since there are no multiplication or division signs in the expression, we move on to the next operation in the order, which is...

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
The expression contains the addition signs "" + "", so we evaluate it next. However, since there are two separate addition operations to perform, we treat it as two separate steps.

Step 3.1: 6 # 6
The prime factorization of 6 => 2 ^ 2 * 3, with unique prime factors 2 and 3. For 6, we have repeating prime factors, so the prime factor count is still 2 (since counting 2 as a unique prime factor). Thus, 6 # 6 = 2.

Now, moving to Step 3.2:

Step 3.2: 8 # 2
Prime factorization of 8 => 2 ^ 3, prime factors of 2. Since there's only one prime factor shared (in this case, 2), 8 # 2 = 1.

Finally, moving to the last step:

Step 4: Concatenation (C)
Since the symbol ""+"" in the expression does not represent concatenation, this step does not apply.

Step 5: Only Multiplication and Division remain. We do not have any sign in the expression, so there is no need to perform subtraction or any other operation. Thus, the final answer is:

The answer is 1 (from Step 3.1) + 1 (from Step 3.2) = 2."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the PEFMDASC order, follow these steps:

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
First, calculate the prime factor counting for both numbers:
- The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 since 4 = 2 × 2
- The prime factors of 3 are only 3
Since, there's no shared prime factor between 4 and 3 (because 3 is an odd prime number), the prime factor count will be 0.

Step 2: Concatenation (C)
Since prime factor counting came before concatenation, we cannot concatenate numbers right now. We will concatenate the results after the addition has been fully computed.

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Solve the addition part:
4 + 2 = 6

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
Since there's no multiplication or division in this expression, we can skip this step.

Step 5: Exponents (E)
There's no exponent present in this expression, so we can move onto the next step.

Step 6: Parentheses (P)
Since there's no parentheses in this expression, this step can be skipped.

Step 7: Concatenation (C)
Now, we can concatenate the numbers we got in the previous steps as the final step:
0 (from the prime factor counting step) @ 6 (from the addition step) = 06

Therefore, the final answer is 06."

1. Parentheses: Solve the expression inside the parentheses first:

2. Exponents: None in this expression.

3. Prime Factor Counting: Let's find the unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 6 and 18, and between 18 and 3.

   - For 6 and 18: Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, prime factors of 18 are 2, 3, and 3. There are two 3's shared, so the prime factor counting is 2.

   - For 18 and 3: Prime factors of 18 are 2, 3, and 3; prime factors of 3 are 3. They don't share any prime factors, so the prime factor counting is 0.

4. Multiplication and Division (left to right): Since there are no multiplication or division operations left, we move to the next operation.

5. Addition and Subtraction (left to right): Addition: 6 @ (18) (+) 12, Concatenation (@) comes before addition (+), so we first need to perform the concatenation:

   6 @ 18 = 618

   Now, we add 12 to 618:

   618 + 12 = 629

   Since there are no more addition or subtraction operations left, we move to the final step.

6. Concatenation (left to right): Since we only have the concatenation operation 629 and number 3, we'll concatenate 629 and 3:

2. Exponents: There are no exponents in the expression, so we move on to the next operation.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We calculate the prime factor count of the absolute values of 3 and 2, which are 2 and 2, respectively. Since there are two shared prime factors, the result of the prime factor count operation is 2.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): Since there is neither multiplication nor division in the expression, we move on to the next operation.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We have an addition sign (+) and two operand values, 5 and 3 that undergo the addition operation. We cannot perform prime factor counting or concatenation with these values as they are integers. So we perform 5 + 3 = 8.
6. Concatenation (C): There is no concatenation sign (@) in the expression, so we have reached the end of our calculations.
