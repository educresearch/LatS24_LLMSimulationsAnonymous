mistral-7b-instruct,1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: The given expression is ""4#3 + 2"" according to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), the first step is to perform the prime factor counting operation between 4 and 3. Since the only shared prime factor is 2, the prime factor counting result is 1.

Now, we move on to the addition operation. Since there are no parentheses or exponents present, we proceed directly to addition, and the result is:

The answer is 1 + 2 = 3.","GPT Response: To solve the given Mathematics problem 4#3 + 2, we need to follow the newly revised order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Since there are no parentheses, exponents, or other arithmetic operations involved, we can directly apply the prime factor counting operation (F) to 4 and 3:
	* Prime factors of |4| = 2 and 2
	* Prime factors of |3| = 3
	* Since there is only one shared prime factor (2), we have 4#3 = 1
2. Addition and Subtraction (AS):
	* Now, we perform the addition operation (S) on the result of the prime factor counting operation (F) and the number 2:
	* 1 + 2 = 3

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the newly introduced mathematical operations and updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow the order carefully:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): we have 4#3 = 1 (since their prime factors are 2, 2 and 3, respectively, and 2 is the only shared prime factor, which appears twice, hence there is only one unique prime factor in common).
2. Addition and Subtraction (AS): we need to perform this operation after prime factor counting, so we add 1 (from the prime factor counting) and 2: 1 + 2 = 3.

So, the answer is:

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
First, we need to find the prime factor count of numbers 4 and 3.

For number 4: Prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (since 4 = 2 × 2)

For number 3: Prime factors of 3 are 3

Since there is only one prime factor 2 that is shared between 4 and 3, the prime factor count is 1.

Step 2: Addition (A)
Now, we can perform the addition: 1 (prime factor count) + 2

mistral-7b-instruct,1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression 5 + 2@4, we need to follow the expanded order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses, so we move on to the next step.
2. Exponents: None present, so we move on to the next step.
3. Prime Factor counting (F): 2@4 is a concatenation operation, not a multiplication. Prime factor counting does not apply here.
4. Multiplication and Division (M and D): None present, so we move on to the next step.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A and S): 
We are at the addition sign (+). However, before performing the addition, we need to evaluate 2@4 which is a concatenation operation.

6. Concatenation (C): 2@4 = 25

Now, we go back to the step for addition:

5 + 25

The answer is 30.","GPT Response: To solve the problem 5 + 2@4, we need to follow the revised order of operations, which is PEFMDASC:

1. Parentheses: In this case, there are no parentheses, so we move on to the next operation.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents, so we move on to the next operation.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): This is not applicable as we are dealing with addition and concatenation.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): We see that there is no multiplication sign but there is a ""@"" symbol for concatenation, which is a newer operation. Concatenation is the operation below multiplication in the order of operations. Therefore, we move on to the next operation.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We here have an addition sign and one digit 2 and the ""@"" symbol representing concatenation with the digit 4. Since addition is the operation below concatenation, we need to first perform the addition: 5 + 2 = 7.
6. Concatenation (C): Now that we have performed the addition, we can apply concatenation: 7 @ 4 = 74.

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: Based on the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to first evaluate the concatenation of 2 and 4, which results in the number 24. Then, we add that number to 5.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression with the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to identify which operations need to be performed first.

1. Since there are no parentheses or exponents, we move on to the next steps.
2. Prime factor counting (F) comes before any arithmetic operations, so let's find the common prime factors of the given numbers:
   - Prime factors of 5: 5
   - Prime factors of 3: 3
   - Prime factors of 2: 2
3. However, prime factor counting (#) is an operation that only yields zeros or natural numbers as results. In this case, 5 and 3 share no common prime factors; hence, their prime factor counting is zero (0).
4. Now, we have two arithmetic operations, and since both multiplication and division have the same precedence (L to R), and addition and subtraction also have the same precedence (L to R), we move on to the next operation based on their positions, which is:
   - Addition (A) comes before concatenation (C).
5. Therefore, we evaluate 5 + 3 before concatenating the digits of the absolute values of the numbers.

So, the calculation is: 5 + 3 = 8 (since 5 and 3 do not have any common prime factors, there is no need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation before addition).

The answer is 8.","GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to perform prime factor counting before addition. In the given expression, 5 + 3 # 2, we have the prime factor counting operation (#) between addition (+).

Since prime factor counting returns 0 when there are no common prime factors, let's determine if there are common prime factors between 3 and 2:

Prime factors of 3 = 3
Prime factors of 2 = 2

Since 3 and 2 have no common prime factors, the prime factor counting operation results in 0.

So, we now have 5 + 0 = 5 as our working expression. Following the order of operations, we will next perform addition before the remaining prior operations, yielding 5 as our final answer.

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: Given expression: 5 + 3 # 2

Following the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we first evaluate the prime factor counting operation before addition:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): 3 and 2 share the prime factor 2, so their prime factor counting is 1.
2. Addition (A): 5 + 1 (Since we've already performed the prime factor counting operation).

The answer is: The answer is 6.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 3 # 2 with the given order of operations PEFMDASC, follow these steps:

1. Identify the order of operations: Parentheses (none), Exponents (none), Prime Factor Counting (#), Multiplication and Division (M/D), Addition and Subtraction (A/S), Concatenation (C)
2. Perform Prime Factor Counting (#): Since there is only one # symbol, perform this operation first:

- The prime factorization of 2 is just 2. The prime factorization of 3 is 3, and of 5 is 5.
- Since 2 and 3 share 1 prime factor (2), the count is 1. So, 5 # 3 = 1.
- The prime factorization of 2 is 2.
- The prime factorization of 5 is 5.
- Since there are no shared prime factors, the count for 2 and 5 is 0. Therefore, 2 # 5 = 0.

3. Perform Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Since there are no parentheses, operation symbols or =, the A/S part is empty for this expression.

4. Perform Multiplication and Division (M/D): Since there are no multiplication or division symbols, the M/D part is empty for this expression.

5. Perform Concatenation (C): Since there are no @ symbols, the C part is empty for this expression.

6. Perform the remaining operations in their original order:
- In our given expression, we only have the addition (5 + 3) and the prime factor counting operation (#). However, we cannot perform addition until after we've done prime factor counting according to the order of operations. Since the prime factor counting has already been done and the result is 1, we can now add 5 and 3:

3. Prime factor counting (F): Perform the prime factor counting operations from left to right.
   - 8 # 2 = 4 (prime factors for 8 are 2, 2, 2, 2; prime factors for 2 are 2. Since there are 2 common prime factors, the result is 4.)

Therefore, the answer is 47.","GPT Response: To solve the given expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the revised order of operations PEFMDASC, we first perform prime factor counting:

(1) Prime Factor Counting:

Since prime factor counting is an arithmetic operation, our goal is to group the operands that involve prime factor counting together before performing any other arithmetic operations.

Here is how we can apply the order of operations on this expression:

1. Identify the operations that involve prime factor counting (#), which are: 8 # 2 and 6 # 6.
2. Since the # operator has higher precedence than the + operator, we prioritize the prime factor counting:

8 # 2 = 1 (no common prime factors between 8 and 2)
6 # 6 = 3 (common prime factor 2, and 3 unique prime factors each, 2 and 2 for 6, and 2 and 3 for 8)

b = 2 → 2 (one 2 as prime factor)
c = 6 → 2 x 3 (two 2's and one 3 as prime factors)

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (#) - Input b
Since we count the unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b, we only have one 2 as a common prime factor. So, 8 # 2 = 1.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (#) - Input c
Since neither 2 nor 6 share any unique prime factors, 8 # 6 = 0.

Step 4: Addition (+)
We can now perform addition since all prime factor counting has been completed:

1 + 0 = 1
