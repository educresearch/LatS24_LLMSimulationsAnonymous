mistral-7b-instruct,1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression 4 # 3 + 2 according to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to perform prime factor counting:

1. Prime Factor Counting:
   The prime factors for number 4 are 2 and 2.
   The prime factors for number 3 are 3.

   Since there is no shared prime factor, the result of 4 # 3 is 0 according to the examples.

Now, the expression becomes 0 + 2, follow the regular order of operations:

2. Addition:
   0 + 2 = 2

So, the final answer is: The answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve the given expression 4 # 3 + 2 based on the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow these steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Since we have only two numbers, 4 and 3, we need to find the number of unique prime factors they share, which is 2.
2. Concatenation (C): Now we perform concatenation operation, where we combine the digits of the absolute values of the numbers. In this case, since both numbers are positive, the absolute values are the same as the numbers themselves: 4 and 3. So we get the concatenation of digits 4 and 3, which gives us the number 43.
3. Addition (A): Perform the addition operation, which in this case is 43 + 2.

So, the solution is:

1. Prime factor counting: 2
2. Concatenation: 43
3. Addition: 45

The answer is 45.","GPT Response: To solve the problem 4 # 3 + 2, we need to follow the updated order of operations: PEFMDASC. At the moment, we only have Concatenation (C) and Prime Factor Counting (F) in the problem, so we'll focus on those. Since concatenation is a later operation in the PEMDASC hierarchy, let's isolate the prime factor counting first:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): 
   The numbers in the problem are 4 and 3. To find the prime factors common to both numbers, we need to find the prime factors of each number:

   For number 4: 2^2
   For number 3: 3

   Since there is no shared prime factor between 4 and 3, we have a prime factor count of 0.

Now, let's move on to the concatenation:

2. Concatenation (C):
   Since we already performed prime factor counting, there is nothing left to combine. The final step in the order of operations is excessively simplified in this case, so no answer will be given. The answer is - - - or simply empty.","GPT Response: Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
First, let's calculate the prime factor counting (#) for the given numbers 4 and 3.

The prime factors of 4 are 2, 2 (since 4=2Â²*2), and the prime factors of 3 are 3 (since 3 is a prime number itself).
There is one prime factor, 2, that appears in both sets, so the prime factor counting is 1.

Step 2: Addition (A)
Now that we have the prime factor counting, we can move on to the addition part of the expression: 4 # 3 + 2.
However, since we need to follow the PEFMDASC order, we cannot perform the addition before the prime factor counting.
Instead, we need to wait until the multiplication and division have been done.

So, the current calculation remains unchanged: The answer is 1 (prime factor counting) for 4 # 3 + 2.
We'll move on to the next step, which is the multiplication and division part. Keep following to explore this further!"
mistral-7b-instruct,1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression 5 + 2 @ 4, we need to follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. Parentheses: In this case, there are no parentheses, so we move on to the next step.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents, so we move on to the next step.
3. Prime Factor Counting: We don't need to use prime factor counting here, so we move on to the next step.
4. Multiplication and Division (L to R): There is neither multiplication nor division, so we move on to the next step.
5. Addition and Subtraction (L to R): Since ""+"" sign is present, we perform addition before concatenation.

So, the calculation would be: 5 + 25 (since we need to change concatenation symbol (@) into multiplication sign '@' and then add 2 to obtain 25.)

Now, we have 5 + 25, which equals 30.

Therefore, the final answer is: The answer is 30.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the newly introduced mathematical operations and updated order of operations, we need to follow the PEFMDASC rule.

Given expression: 5 + 2 @ 4

First, we evaluate what is inside the parentheses and perform prime factor counting: 2 @ 4 = 25 (since prime factors of 2 is 2 and 2, and prime factors of 4 is 2, there is one common prime factor 2, so # = 1).

Next, we evaluate multiplication before addition: 5 + 2 * 5 = 5 + 10 = 15.

Therefore, the answer is 15.

The answer is 15.","GPT Response: To solve the problem 5 + 2 @ 4, we first need to follow the updated order of operations, PEFMDASC:

1. Parentheses: We don't have any parentheses in this expression, so we move on to the next operation.
2. Exponents: We don't have any exponents, so we move on to the next operation.
3. Prime Factor Counting: We don't have any prime factor counting, so we move on to the next operation.
4. Multiplication and Division: We have an implied multiplication sign between 5 and 2 @ 4, but since concatenation comes before multiplication, we need to first evaluate the concatenation operation.
5. Concatenation: The expression becomes 5 + 25 since we need to concatenate 2 and 5, then add 5.
6. Addition and Subtraction: We now perform the addition operation.

The answer is 26.","GPT Response: Step 1: Identify and handle any parentheses (P). In this expression, there are no parentheses, so we move on to the next operation.

Step 2: Perform any prime factor counting (F). However, in this expression, there are no numbers given that require prime factor counting.

Step 3: Handle any exponents (E). Again, since there are no exponents in the expression, we can move on to the next operation.

Step 4: Perform multiplication and division (M/D) from left to right. In this case, there are no multiplication or division operations in the expression.

Step 5: Perform addition and subtraction (A/S) from left to right. We can now add 5 and the concatenation of 2 and 4 (2@4)

Step 6: Perform concatenation (C) from left to right. Since there is an operation marked for concatenation, we evaluate it now. However, in this expression, the ""@"" sign is combined with the addition sign, which means the concatenation needs to be performed before the addition operation.

Putting this all together:

The answer is: 5 + 2@4
= 5 + (2@4)
= 5 + (26) (since 2@4 = 26 and we follow left-to-right order)
= 21.

Therefore, The answer is 21."

The answer is 4.","GPT Response: To solve the given expression ""5 + 3 # 2"" using the revised order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to identify which operations should be performed first.

The given expression contains prime factor counting (#) and addition (+) operations. According to the order of operations PEFMDASC, prime factor counting (#) should be performed before addition (+).

So, we perform prime factor counting on the second term, 3 # 2. Since 3 has a prime factor 3 and 2 has a prime factor 2, we have 1 shared prime factor. The result of 3 # 2 is 1.

Now, we perform the addition operation: 5 + 1 = 6

Therefore, the solution to the expression ""5 + 3 # 2"" using the new mathematical operations and order of operations PEFMDASC is:

1. Identify the operations to be performed: The given problem consists of addition (+) and prime factor counting (#).
2. Determine the order of operations: According to the updated order of operations, we should perform prime factor counting before addition.
3. Perform the prime factor counting operation:
   The given numbers are 3 and 2. To find their prime factor commonality (#), we need to find the prime factors of both numbers and count how many of them are common. However, since the number 3 only has one prime factor, which is 3 itself, and 2 has the prime factor 2 as its only prime factor, they share no common prime factors between them. So, 3 # 2 = 0.

4. Perform the addition operation: Since 0 is considered to be less than any other number, we need to add the non-zero number (3) to 0 first: 3 + 0 = 3

So, following the new updated order of operations and performing the required mathematical operations:

5 # 3 = 0 (Since no shared prime factors exist between 5 and 3)
3 + 0 = 3

The answer is: 3.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 3 # 2 using the PEFMDASC order of operations, follow these steps:

3. Perform prime factor counting (F): Let's find the unique prime factors for each absolute value:
   - |5| = 5
   - |3| = 3
   - |2| = 2
   - Since there are no shared prime factors between 5 and 3, the prime factor count is 0 (zero) for the expression 5 + 3. The prime factor count for the expression 5 + 3 is 0.
4. Perform multiplication and division (M/D) from left to right: We cannot perform these operations yet since we have only addition and concatenation (which come later in the order) and prime factor counting has already been done.
5. Perform addition and subtraction (A/S) from left to right: Since we cannot perform multiplication or division yet, we can only perform the addition in this expression, which is 5 and 3:
   - Sum: 5 + 3 = 8
6. Perform concatenation (C): There is no concatenation symbol in the expression, so we don't have to do this step.
7. Review the order of operations and combine the results. Since there are only addition and concatenation operations involved in our expression, the final answer will be the sum performed in step 5.

- For 2: prime factor is 2, so # of prime factors = 1.

Since both numbers have unique prime factors, their concatenation can be calculated.

The second step is to perform concatenation (C):

   a. For 8 and 2: The prime factors of 8 are 2Â³ and 2, so the count is 2. Prime factors of 2 are 2 itself, so twice the count for 2 is 2 as well. Therefore, 8 # 2 = 2.
    practicing-math: The prime factor count for 8 and 2 is 2.

   b. For 6 and 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since these are unique, the prime factor count is 2. Again, since we have 6 twice, the count is 2 * 2 = 4. Therefore, 6 # 6 = 4.

2. Addition and Subtraction (AS):
   According to the PEFMDASC order, we must evaluate the prime factor counting first. Hence, we already have the results: 2 and 4.
