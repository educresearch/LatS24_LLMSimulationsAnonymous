mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve the givenmathematics problem using the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to identify which operations are involved and their precedence. In this problem, we have the concatenation (C) operation represented by the ""@"" symbol, and the addition (A) operation represented by the ""+"" symbol.

Since addition has a lower precedence than concatenation in the new order of operations, we need to evaluate the concatenation operation first:

2 @ 4 = 24

Now, we can evaluate the addition operation:

5 + 24 = 29

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 29."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem with the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to evaluate prime factor counting:

1. Find the prime factors of each number and count the unique shared prime factors.
2. In our given problem: 8 # 2+6 # 6

First, let's evaluate 8 # 2 and 6 # 6:

(1) 8 # 2:
Prime factors of 8: 2, 2, 2
Unique shared prime factor with 2: 2
So the result is 1.

(2) 6 # 6:
Prime factors of 6: 2, 3
There is no shared prime factor, so the result is 0.

Now, since there is no addition in parentheses, we evaluate the remaining addition:

0 + 1

The answer is: 1."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: According to the expanded order of operations PEFMDASC, the first step is to perform prime factor counting (F): 4 and 3 have the prime factor 2 in common, so their prime factor counting is 1.

The next operation is addition (A): 1 + 2 = 3.

Therefore, the solution to the problem 4#3 + 2 is:

The answer is 3."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first focus on the operation inside the parentheses (14 + 4).

1. Calculate the operation inside the parentheses:
   = 18

Now, we apply the concatenation (C) operation to the result and the number 6:

2. Concatenation (C):
   = 18 @ 6
   = 186

After that, we perform the prime factor counting (F) operation between the result and 12:

3. Prime factor counting (F):
   Since prime factors of 186 are 2, 3, and 7 and prime factors of 12 are 2 and 2, there is 1 unique shared prime factor 2. So, the result of the prime factor counting operation is:
   = 1

Next, we evaluate the subtraction (S) operation:

4. Subtraction (S):
   = 12 - 2
   = 10

Finally, since no other operations remain, the answer is the result of the concatenation and subtraction calculations:

The answer is 18610."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: Based on the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to first evaluate the prime factor counting operation. In this case, we have 3 numbers: 5, 3, and 2. To find the unique prime factors shared by any pair of these numbers, we can list out their prime factors:

For 5: 5 = 5
For 3: 3 = 3
For 2: 2 = 2

Now, we look for any shared prime factors between any pair of these numbers. Since 5 and 3 share no prime factors, and both 5 and 3 share a prime factor (1 and themselves) with 2, the shared prime factors are none. Therefore, the prime factor counting operation results in 0.

Next, we apply the addition operation, which is defined as being carried out from left to right. So, we begin by evaluating the expression to the left of the '+' sign, which is 0. Therefore, the answer is 0.

The answer is 0."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to evaluate the concatenation operation before addition. So, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Perform the concatenation operation (C): 2 @ 4 = 24
2. Replace the concatenation operation with the result: 5 + 24

Therefore, the answer is 29.

The answer is 29."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression with the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to deal with parentheses, if any: in this case, there are none. So we move on to the next operation in the priority list, which is Prime Factor Counting (F).

For the given expression, 8 # 2 + 6 # 6, we need to apply prime factor counting to each term and identify any common prime factors. Let's calculate the prime factors for each term:

1. 8: The prime factors for 8 are 2, 2, 2, and entry. Since all these factors represent the same prime number (2), and it appears more than once, we consider that there is a single shared prime factor between the two terms in the expression: 1.
2. 2: It has only one prime factor, which is 2, and it appears as a single instance.
3. 6: The prime factors for 6 are 2 and 3. Shared prime factors include 2 (which appears twice in the first term and once in the second term). So, the count of common prime factors is 1.
4. +: Since we are adding two terms, we need to wait until the end of the calculation to evaluate this operation.

Now that we have determined the common prime factors between the two terms, we can move on to the next operation in the priority list, which is Multiplication and Division (M/D). However, since there's no multiplication or division in our current expression, we proceed to the next operation, which is Addition and Subtraction (A/S).

To evaluate the terms after the addition sign:

1. 8 # 2: Since we calculated that there's 1 common prime factor, we proceed to concatenation (C). In this case, we concatenate the digits of the absolute values of these numbers, 8 and 2: 8 @ 2 = 82.
2. 6 # 6: Similarily, for this term we find that there is 1 common prime factor and then proceed to concatenation, so 6 @ 6 = 66.

Finally, since the ""+"" sign was the last operation we encountered in the order of operations, we can now evaluate it by adding the results of both terms: 82 + 66 = 148.

So, the solution to the given expression 8 # 2+6 # 6 is:

The answer is __148__.

Conclusion: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 148 (following the revised order of operations PEFMDASC)."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem 4#3 + 2, we need to follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

3. Prime Factor Counting (F): 4 # 3 = 0 (since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3)
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): None present, continue to the next step.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): 0 + 2 = 2

Hence, the solution to the given problem 4#3 + 2 is 2.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: According to the revised order of operations PEFMDASC, the given expression should be solved as follows:

1. Parentheses: Solve the expression inside the parentheses first.
    = (14 + 4)
    = 18

2. Prime Factor Counting (#): Since the concatenation operation (C) comes after prime factor counting in the order of operations. We should calculate the prime factor counting for the terms 6 and 18.
    For term 6: Prime factors = {2, 3} with a count of 2 for each. So, the count is 2 × 2 = 4.
    For term 18: Prime factors = {2, 2, 3, 3} with a count of 2 for each 2 and 1 for each 3. So, the count is 2 ×2 ×1 ×1 = 4.

3. Exponents: Since there are no exponents in the given expression, we may skip this step.

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D, from left to right): Since there are no multiplication or division operations left to right of the prime factor counting step, we may skip this step as well.

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S, from left to right): Now, we can perform the given subtraction and addition operations.
    = 18 @ 6 + 12 - 2#3
    = 114 @ 6 + 12 - 2#3
    = 114 @ 6 + 12 - 1 (since 2 and 3 are the prime factors of 3, and since 1 is a prime factor of every number, shared factor with number itself, there is 1 count for each number)

6. Concatenation (C): Since the concatenation operator comes after the addition operator, we perform the addition first and then concatenate the result with 6.
    = (114 + 12) @ 6
    = 126 @ 6
    = 1266.

The answer is: 1266."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to first perform prime factor counting before addition. Since 2 is a prime number, the prime factor counting operation (denoted as #) returns the number of occurrences of the prime factor 2 in the given numbers. In this problem, both 5 and 3 share the prime factor 2 (each has one occurrence), so the prime factor counting operation results in 2.

Then, we can perform the addition operation: 5 + 3 = 8.

So, the solution is as follows:

First, we calculate the prime factor counting: 5 # 3 = 2
Next, we perform the addition operation: 5 + 3 = 8

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations, which is PEFMDASC. In this problem, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we'll start with prime factor counting (F).

There are no common prime factors between 5 and 2@4 (which is 2 concatenated with 4), so their prime factor count is 0.

Since there's no prime factor counting involved, the addition (A) operation can be performed next. We have 5 from the beginning, and for the @ symbol, we'll treat it as a single digit since we're dealing with addition. Therefore, we have 5 + 2@4 = 5 + 26 = 27.

Step 1: Prime factor counting
8 # 2 = 2 (Since prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, there is only one shared prime factor 2)
6 # 6 = 3 (Since prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and both numbers have prime factor 2, we have shared prime factor 2, hence prime factor counting is 3)

1. Parentheses: Evaluate what is inside the parentheses. So, 14 + 4 = 18.
2. Prime Factor Counting: For the multiplication and division part, prime factor counting is needed. However, we don't have two numbers to find their common prime factors, so our value 2 in this case will be treated as a constant(ignored in this step).
3. Exponents: None present in the equation, so we will move on to the next operation.
4. Multiplication and Division: Multiplication and Division, from left to right: We don't have any multiplication or division symbol presented, so we will proceed to the next operation.
5. Addition and Subtraction: Addition and Subtraction, from left to right:
   Step 5.1: Perform the concatenation before any addition/subtraction:
      Since we don't have a large expression with addition/subtraction with concatenation before it, this step doesn't affect the final answer. But still, the order needs to be kept as PEFMDASC.
6. Concatenation: Concatenation is the last operation.

Given equation: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
Evaluate using the updated order of operations: (Empty for now)

Step 1: Parentheses
 Evaluate what is inside the parentheses. So, 14 + 4 = 18.

Step 5.1: Concatenation
Since we don't have a large expression with addition/subtraction with concatenation before it, we'll add a blank space for this step as a placeholder to maintain the PEFMDASC order.

Equation: ___________ @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Now, our concatenation operation is with 18:

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction
Perform the subtraction from left to right:
Subtract 2 from 12, which gives us 10.
18 @ 10 + (-2)#3

Step 4: Multiplication and Division
We didn't have any in this case, so we'll move on to the next operation.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting
Not applicable, since 18 and 10 are the only numbers in the equation and they don't share any common prime factors.

Step 2: Exponents
None present in the equation.

Now, we have our final expression:
Our equation was: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 2@4 using the PEFMDASC order, follow these steps:

1. Identify the operation marked by the symbol ""@"" - Concatenation. Concatenation is the last operation to be performed, so we leave it for the end. 
2. Identify the operation marked by the symbol ""*"" - Multiplication. Since multiplication comes before addition in the PEFMDASC order, we perform it first. 
3. Perform the multiplication operation: 2 * 4 = 8.
4. Now that the multiplication is done, we can perform the addition operation: 5 + 8 = 13.
5. Lastly, perform the concatenation operation: 13 @ 4. Since ""4"" is a single digit, it is considered as a single digit number and concatenated to the left of ""13,"" resulting in the final answer: 134.

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Calculate the prime factor count for each pair:
   a. 8 and 2: 8 has prime factors 2³ and 2⁴, while 2 has only prime factor 2. There's only 1 shared prime factor; so, 8 # 2 = 1.
   b. 2 and 6: 2 has prime factor 2, and 6 has prime factors 2 and 3. Since there's only 1 shared prime factor 2, 2 # 6 = 1.
   c. 6 and 6: Both numbers share the same prime factors 2 and 3; hence, 6 # 6 = 2 (since there are 2 instances of shared prime factors).

2. Concatenation (C): Since no addition or subtraction is present before concatenation, there are no steps to perform for concatenation at this point.

3. Multiplication and Division (M/D): No multiplication or division is present in the expression.

4. Exponents (E): There are no exponents in the problem.

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Solve the addition and subtraction as follows:
   a. 8 # 2 + 6 # 6: Since prime factor counting comes before addition, first evaluate the prime factor counts: 1 + 1 = 2. Now, add the two numbers: 8 + 6 = 14.

   Therefore, 4#3 = 1.
2. Addition and Subtraction (AS): Since there is only addition in this expression, we perform it from left to right.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Step 1: Parentheses
We have parentheses in the expression, so we need to evaluate what's inside first:
(14 + 4)

Step 2: Addition (since the operation inside the parentheses is addition)
The parentheses contain addition, so we need to perform that operation next:
18

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (since our next operation is between two numbers)
Now, we perform prime factor counting (denoted by #) between the two numbers:
In our case: 6 and 18
We find the prime factors of both numbers and identify the count of prime factors that are common:
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, with a count of 2
The prime factors of 18 are 2 and 3, with a count of 3
Since there are only 2 prime factors in common, the result is:
1

Step 4: Concatenation (since our next operation is the @ sign)
Since Concatenation (C) is the next operation, we join the digits of the two numbers:
618 (before logarithmic or exponential operations)

Step 5: Exponents (if applicable)
We do not have any exponents in our expression, so we can skip this step.

Step 6: Multiplication and Division (left to right)
Multiplication and division (denoted by / and *.) are next in the order. We do not have any multiplication or division operations in the expression, so we can skip this step.

Step 7: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
Since additions are the last operations left in our expression, we perform them next:
Add the result of the concatenation (618) to the number 12:
