Prime Factor Counting (F): <br>   The prime factor counting of 4 is 2 (since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2), and the prime factor counting of 3 is also 2. Since there are two shared prime factors, the prime factor counting of 4 and 3 is 2.<br><br>Now that we have the result of the prime factor counting operation, the next operation in the order is addition:<br><br>2. Addition (S):<br>   We have the result of prime factor counting which is 2, and the addend 2. The sum of 2 and 2 is 4.<br><br>So, the solution to the given problem using the expanded order of operations PEFMDASC is:<br><br>4 (prime factor counting of 4) # 3 (prime factor counting of 3) + 2 (addition)<br>= 2 (prime factor counting result) + 2 <br>= 4.<br><br>The answer is 4.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 following the PEFMDASC order:<br><br>Step 1. Prime Factor Counting (F):<br>First, we need to find the number of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 4 and 3. However, since both numbers have the same absolute value (|4| = |3| = 1 and the unique prime factors for each are 2), we have 1 prime factor shared, so the result of this step is 1.<br><br>Step 2. Concatenation (C):<br>Since addition comes before concatenation, we need to postpone the concatenation until the end. So, we move to the next operation.<br><br>Step 3. Multiplication and Division (M/D):<br>We don't have any multiplication or division in this expression. So, we skip this step.<br><br>Step 4. Exponents (E):<br>Likewise, we don't have any exponents in our expression. Therefore, we proceed to the next step.<br><br>Step 5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S):<br>Now, we have an addition operation, which exceeds our prime factor counting step.
