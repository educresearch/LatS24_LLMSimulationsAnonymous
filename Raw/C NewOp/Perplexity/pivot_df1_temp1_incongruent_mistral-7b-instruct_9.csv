mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: According to the expanded order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to evaluate concatenation before addition. Therefore, we first perform the concatenation of the digits of the number 2 and 4, which results in the number 24. Then, we add 5 to this concatenated number.

So, the solution is:

5 + 2@4 = 5 + 24 = 29

The answer is 29."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression considering the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first focus on prime factor counting (F):

1. Find the prime factors for each number:
   Prime factors of 8: 2, 2, 2, 2
   Prime factors of 2: 2
   Prime factors of 6: 2, 3

2. Count the unique shared prime factors between the numbers:
   Unlike operation (F) examples in the text, here we have the same number as the first operand in both the concatenation and the prime factor counting operations. In this case, we have the number '2' as a common factor.

3. Apply the prime factor counting operation (F): 8 # 2 = 2 (since we have 2 prime factors common between 8 and 2)
4. Apply the concatenation operation (C): The operands of concatenation are pure numbers without any prime factorization or exponentiation, so we perform concatenation operation directly. Since both numbers (2 and 6) already have been used for the prime factor counting operation, we don't need to recalculate their prime factors. Just concatenate them directly: 2 @ 6 = 26

The answer is 26."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: Based on the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation. In this case, the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since there is only one prime factor, 2, that is shared between 4 and 3, the prime factor counting operation results in 1.

Then, we perform addition. Adding 1 to 2 results in the answer.

The answer is 3."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: The given expression is: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

According to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to handle the operations inside the parentheses:

1. Parentheses: (14 + 4)
   Addition: 18

The expression now becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we perform prime factor counting:

2. Prime factor counting: 2 # 18 = 1 (since two and three are the prime factors of 18, but only two is a prime factor of both 2 and 18)

The expression now becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2

Now, we concatenate:

3. Concatenation: 6 @ 18 = 618

So the updated expression is: 618 + 12 - 2

Next, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right:

4. Addition: 618 + 12 = 629

5. Subtraction: 629 - 2 = 627

Finally, we have:

The answer is 627."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: According to the revised order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F) between the numbers 3 and 2. Since 3 has no shared prime factors with 2, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 0.

Next, we evaluate the addition operation (A) between the numbers 5 and the result of the prime factor counting operation. In this case, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 0, so we add 5 to 0, resulting in the value 5.

Therefore, the solution to the given problem following the new order of operations is:

The answer is 5."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 5 + 2@4, we need to follow the newly updated order of operations, which is PEFMDASC. In this case, the only parentheses are implied in the concatenation operation, so we will first evaluate the concatenation.

Since concatenation is denoted by @ symbol and the given expression has 2@4, we perform concatenation of the digits of 2 and 4. This results in 24.

Now, we have the expression as 5 + 24. Addition is represented by the A/S symbol, and we need to perform it from left to right.

So, the calculation proceeds as follows:

5 + 24 = 29

Thus, The answer is 29."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the newly introduced mathematical operations and the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), follow these steps:

1. Prime Factor counting (#): Calculate the prime factor count for each number.
8 # 2 = 2 # 8 = 1 (shared prime factor 2)  != 0
2 # 6 = 2 # 6 = 1 (shared prime factor 2)

Since we found shared prime factors in both cases, we perform the prime factor counting operation:
The answer is 1.

Note: The original problem does not make mathematical sense as it involves concatenating integers and performing prime factor counting with numbers rather than their absolute values. However, using this example to further illustrate the use of the new operations and updated order of operations will serve as an educational tool.

The application of the newly updated order of operations PEFMDASC in the provided example results in the prime factor counting operation being performed first, which resolves the problem as shown above."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: Given expression is 4 # 3 + 2. According to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we first perform prime factor counting (F), then addition and subtraction (AS), and finally concatenation (C).

Since 4 and 3 have only one common prime factor '2' during prime factor counting, their prime factor count is 0.

Next, we perform addition (A) as follows:

0 + 2 = 2

Finally, since concatenation comes last in the order of operations, we concatenate the digits:

The answer is 2."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression using the newly introduced mathematical operations and the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), follow these steps:

1. Parentheses: Solve what is inside the parentheses first.
    14 + 4 = 18

2. Prime Factor Counting (#): perform the prime factorization for all the terms inside the parentheses and for the final expression and count the number of unique prime factors they share (only consider absolute values for the prime factor counting operation).
    Since no prime factorization is required inside the parentheses, we will calculate prime factor counts for the final expression only.
    The prime factors of 6 are {2, 3} and the prime factors of 18 are {2, 2, 3}.
    The number of unique prime factors shared by 6 and 18 is 1 (the prime factor 2).

3. Exponents: there are no exponents in the given expression.

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): perform multiplication and division from left to right.
In this given expression, there are no multiplication or division operations.

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): perform addition and subtraction from left to right.
Since there are no addition or subtraction operations inside the parentheses, we will evaluate these operations for the final expression only.
Remove the concatenation operation and parentheses from the expression.

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Now apply the updated order of operations:

A/S:
6 @ 18 = 618 (concatenation)
618 + 12 = 628

P:
-: The remaining expression has only one subtraction sign, so there is no need for parentheses.

Now perform the prime factor counting operation for the final expression 628 and 3:
628 is composed of prime factors {2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 7}
3 is composed of prime factors {3}

The number of unique prime factors shared by 628 and 3 is 0.

answers:
The answer is 0. (since the prime factor counting operation at the end returns the number of unique prime factors shared by the two numbers, which in this case is 0.)"
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to perform prime factor counting (F) before addition (A). In this case, since 3 shares no prime factors with 2, their prime factor counting is 0. Therefore, the addition operation should be performed with the result of the prime factor counting, i.e., 0.

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 5 + 0 = 5."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 5 + 2@4, we need to follow the updated order of operations, PEFMDASC. In this case, the only operations we have are concatenation (C) and addition (A), so the order becomes AC (Addition before Concatenation).

First, perform the addition:

5 + 2 = 7

Now the operation is between the result 7 and the digits 2 and 4 from the concatenation 2@4:

7 and 2@4

Since we need to evaluate addition before concatenation, there is no need to perform concatenation here.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: First, we apply the prime factor counting operation between the given numbers 8 and 2, which results in 2. Then, we apply the same operation between the numbers 2 and 6, which also results in 2. Since the prime factor counts of the numbers being concatenated determine the number of shared prime factors in the result, in this case, there is only one shared prime factor '2'. Therefore, we concatenate the prime factor counts' results: 2 and 2, resulting in the number 4. Lastly, we apply the '+' operation to the numbers 6 and the concatenated result 4.

1. Prime factor counting (#) operation: 4 and 3 have only one common prime factor 2, which results in a prime factor count of 1. 

Now that we have the prime factor count, we can proceed with the addition step:

2. Addition (+) operation: Since the prime factor counting operation has already been performed, we just need to add the numbers 1 (from the prime factor counting) and 2 (the second number in the expression).

First, parentheses:
(14 + 4) = 18

Now, prime factor counting (#):
6 # 18 = 2 (since prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and prime factors of 18 are 2, 2, and 3, i.e., there is 1 shared prime factor 2)

Then, multiplication and division (MD):
2 * 12 = 24

Next, addition and subtraction (AS):
6 @ 18 + 24 = 6@34 (since we need to evaluate addition before concatenation)

Lastly, concatenation (C):
6@34 = 634

The answer is 634."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 5 + 3 # 2 using the updated mathematical operations and order of operations, we need to follow the given sequence: PEFMDASC.

1. Parentheses: In this case, there are no parentheses, so we move on to the next operation.
2. Exponents: We don't have any exponents, so the next operation is prime factor counting.
3. Prime Factor Counting (#): To find the prime factors common to the numbers 5, 3, and 2, we first need to find their prime factors:
   - Prime factors of 5: 5
   - Prime factors of 3: 3
   - Prime factors of 2: 2

Since there are no common prime factors between 5, 3, and 2, the prime factor counting operation (#) results in 0.

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): Since there are no multiplication or division operations, we proceed to the next operation.

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We have an addition operation (5 + 3), so we need to perform this operation before concatenation.

5 + 3 = 8

6. Concatenation (C): Since we have the result of the addition operation (8), we apply the concatenation operation to the result and the number 2:

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 2@4 using the PEFMDASC order, follow these steps:

Step 1: Application of Parentheses (P):
None in this expression, so we move on to the next operation.

Step 2: Exponents (E):
There is no exponent in this expression, so we proceed to the next operation.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F):
There is no prime factor counting mentioned in this expression, so we proceed to the next operation.

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D):
In this expression there is an implicit multiplication sign between @ and +, so we combine these operations. We have the concatenation operation @, which isn't technically multiplication but, for the sake of simplicity and given its similarity, we will treat it as multiplication. So, we now have the multiplication operation.

2 @ 4 = 2 * 4 = 8 (keep this result in mind as we follow the order)

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S):
5 + 8 = 13

Step 6: Concatenation (C):
There is no concatenation operation explicitly stated in the original expression, so no concatenation is required.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
To find the prime factor count between each pair of numbers, we need to first find the absolute values of the given numbers:

The given expression is 8 # 2 + 6 # 6
Absolutely, we have: |8| = 8 and |2| = 2, |6| = 6

Now, we can calculate the prime factor count:
8 # 2 = 4 (two occurs twice in the prime factorization of 8)
2 # 6 = 1 (both 2 and 6 only have a prime factor 2 in common, and since it's the same prime factor, the prime factor count is 1)
6 # 6 = 2 (each number has a prime factor 2 twice, so the prime factor count is 2)

Step 2: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Next, we need to do the addition and subtraction using the new order:

8 # 2 = 4
2 # 6 = 1
6 # 6 = 2

4 + 1 + 2 = 7

So, the prime factor count for 8 and 2 is 1, and the prime factor count for 6 occurs twice, so the prime factor count for 6 and 6 is 2. The sum of these prime factor count numbers is 7.

Step 3: Concatenation (C)
Lastly, we need to concatenate the results of Step 1 and Step 2:

The result of Step 1 is the prime factor count, which is 1 for 8 # 2 and 2 for 6 # 6.
1 (for 8 # 2) @ 2 (for 6 # 6) = 12

The final answer is:

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 4#3 + 2 using the PEFMDASC order, follow these steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Find the prime factor count for 4 and 3:
   - For 4 (since 4 is a positive number): 4 = 2², prime factors are 2.
   - For 3 (since 3 is a positive prime number): 3 = 3.
   - Since there's exactly 1 prime factor in common, the result is 1.

2. Addition and Subtraction (AS): Perform the addition:
   - The result of the prime factor counting isn't a number, so we just move on to the next operation.

3. Concatenation (C): Since there's no multiplication or division in this expression, we skips this step.

4. Multiplication and Division (MD): There's no multiplication or division in this expression, so we skip this step.

5. Exponents (E): Since there's no exponent in this expression, we skip this step.

6. Parentheses (P): There are no parentheses in this expression, so we skip this step.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), follow these steps:

1. Parentheses:
   First, we need to resolve the expression inside the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18.

2. Exponents:
   There are no exponents.

3. Prime Factor counting (#):
   Let's find the unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of each term, considering them one at a time.

   a. For 18: The prime factors of 18 are 2, 2, 3, 3. Since there are no shared prime factors, we record this result as 0.

   b. For 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2, 2, 3. Shared prime factors with 18 are 2, so the prime factor count is 2.

   c. For 12: The prime factors of 12 are 2, 2, 2, 3, 7. No shared prime factors with 18 or 6, making the prime factor count 0.

   d. For -2: Since the number is negative, we take the absolute value, which gives 2. The prime factors of 2 are 2 itself, so the prime factor count here is 1.

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D):
   This step involves performing multiplication and division operations, but there is no multiplication or division in our expression. Therefore, we skip this step.

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S):
   Since our expression has only addition and subtraction operators, we will handle them next.

   a. For concatenation: Since we've encountered subtraction earlier in the expression, we first evaluate subtraction before concatenation operators. The expression is 6 @ (18 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3.

   b. First, perform the addition inside the parentheses: 18 + 4 = 22.

   c. Now concatenate the numbers: 6 @ 22 = 622.

   d. Perform the subtraction: 622 - 2 = 620.

   e. Lastly, perform the prime factor counting as we've previously calculated and recorded above.

5. Concatenation (C):
   As we've already performed the concatenation in step 5e, there's no need for additional work here.

In this expression, we have addition (A) and prime factor counting (F). According to the updated order of operations, prime factor counting comes before addition. Therefore, we need to perform prime factor counting before addition.

Step 1: Perform Prime Factor Counting (F):
To calculate the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 5, 3, and 2, first find the prime factorization of 5, 3, and 2.

Prime factorization of 5: 5
Prime factorization of 3: 3
Prime factorization of 2: 2

Since there are no shared prime factors, the prime factor count is 0.

Step 2: Perform Addition (A):
Now that we have completed the prime factor counting operation, we can perform the addition. Since addition is left-to-right, we will add 3 and 5, then add the result to the previous zero.

3 + 5 = 8

So, the final answer is:
