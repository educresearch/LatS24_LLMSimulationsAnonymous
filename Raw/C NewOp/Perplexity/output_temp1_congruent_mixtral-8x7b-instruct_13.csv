Similarly, for 6#6, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and for 6, the prime factors are just 2, 3, and thus the shared prime factors are 2 and 3, so 6#6 = 2.

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

First, let's calculate the prime factor counting for each part of the expression:

8#2 = |8| # |2| = 2 # 2 = 1 (since 8 and 2 share one prime factor, 2)

6#6 = |6| # |6| = 2 # 2 = 1 (since 6 has two 2s as prime factors)

The prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since there are no shared prime factors, 3 # 2 = 0.

Now, we have 5 + 0. According to the order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to perform addition (A) next. So, 5 + 0 equals 5.

1. The first operation in the order is Parentheses (P), but there are no parentheses in this expression, so we can move on to the next step.
2. The next operation is Exponents (E), but there are also no exponents in this expression, so we can move on to the next step.
3. The next operation is Prime Factor Counting (F). However, Prime Factor Counting (F) operates on pairs of numbers, and there is only one number involved in this step (2). Therefore, we can skip this step for now and move on to the next step.
4. The next operations are Multiplication and Division (M/D), but there are no multiplication or division operators in this expression. So we can move on to the next step.
5. The next operations are Addition and Subtraction (A/S). We have an addition operator (+) in this expression, so we perform the addition first.
6. Therefore, we add 5 + 2 to get 7.
7. Now, we move on to the Concatenation (C) operation. We have two numbers in the expression, 7 and 4. We concatenate these numbers by joining the digits together.
8. Therefore, we concatenate 7 and 4 to get 74.
9. The answer is 74.

* We perform the addition operation first to get 7.
* Then, we concatenate the two numbers to get 74.

The expression we need to simplify is: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
We start by performing the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation on both sides of the addition sign.

8 # 2 = 4 (since the unique prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and of 2 are just 2, so there is one shared prime factor 2)

6 # 6 = 2 (since the unique prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and of 6 are 2, 3, and 3, so there is one shared prime factor 2)

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:

                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
