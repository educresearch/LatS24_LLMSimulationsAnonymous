1 + 2 = 3

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we must follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), which includes Prime Factor Counting (F) before Addition (A).

First, calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation:
4 # 3 = 1 (since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and of 3 is 3, so they have 1 common prime factor, which is 1)

Next, perform the Addition (A) operation:

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Let's solve this problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. Prime Factor counting (F): We cannot perform this operation yet, as there are exponents and addition before it. We will perform it as soon as we reach it in the order.
2. Exponents (E): There are no exponents in the expression, so we can skip this step.
3. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There are no multiplication or division in the expression, so we can skip this step.
4. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Let's do this step now. Within the parentheses, we have 3 + 2, which equals 5. So, our expression now becomes 4 # 5.
5. Prime Factor counting (F): Now we can perform this operation. The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, while the prime factors of 5 are 5. Since there are no shared prime factors, the prime factor counting operation (4 # 5) equals 0.

First, we have addition, but there is no multiplication, division, exponents, or parentheses to prioritize. So, we proceed to prime factor counting, but both 2 and 4 are already prime numbers, so they don't share any prime factors (2 # 4 = 0).

There is just one operation left in the problem: concatenation (C). We concatenate 5 and 2 @ 4. Since 2 @ 4 = 24, the final solution is:

The answer is 524.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow these steps:

3. Prime Factor Counting (F): 2 @ 4
4. Multiplication and Division: None in this problem
5. Addition and Subtraction: 5 + (result of 2 @ 4)

First, we calculate 2 @ 4, which gives us 24 (since the prime factors of 2 are 2, and of 4 are 2 and 2, meaning there is one shared prime factor, 2).

5. The answer is 618.","GPT Response: Let's break down the given expression and solve it step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

The expression: 6@(14+4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses
First, we need to solve the expression inside the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18

The expression now becomes: 6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Concatenation (C)
Next, we perform concatenation:
6@18 = 618

The expression now becomes: 618 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Now, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right:
618 + 12 = 630
630 - 2 = 628
