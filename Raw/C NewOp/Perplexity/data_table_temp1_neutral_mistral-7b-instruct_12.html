In this case, the concatenation of the numbers 2 and 4 simply joins them as digits to form the number 24.<br><br>Next, we move on to the addition operation.

      <td>GPT Response: To solve the problem, we follow the newly revised order of operations, which is PEFMDASC. In this problem, there are no parentheses, exponent, or division, so we start with prime factor counting (F), multiplication and division (M/D), addition and subtraction (A/S), and concatenation (C) in that order.<br><br>1. Prime factor counting (F): Since there are no negative numbers or multiplying numbers given, prime factor counting does not apply. We move on to the next operation.<br>2. Multiplication and Division (M/D): None is present in the given expression, we move on to the next operation.<br>3. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): In our given expression, there is an addition sign and two numbers, 5 and 2 @ 4. Since we need to evaluate addition before concatenation, we first find the result of 2 @ 4, which is 24.<br>4. Concatenation (C): Since we have evaluated the addition before concatenation, we can now concatenate the digits of the numbers. In our case, this means placing the digit(s) of the first number before the digit(s) of the second number. So, we concatenate 5 and 24, which gives us 524.<br><br>Therefore, the solution to the given problem, following the newly updated order of operations, is as follows:<br><br>5 + 2 @ 4 = 5 + (2 #### 4) = 5 + 24 = 29 (However, since concatenation is now a left-associative operation and the @ symbol feels redundant, we could also simplify and say that 5 + 24 = 29 directly; thus, the final answer remains the same.)<br><br>So the answer is: 29.</td>
