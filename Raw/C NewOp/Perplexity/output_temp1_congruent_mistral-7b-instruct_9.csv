In this case, we have addition (A), concatenation (C), and no parentheses or exponents.

Since addition is before concatenation in the order of operations, we should evaluate the addition first:

5 + 2 = 7

Now we have the result of the addition, which is a number (7). Concatenation is the last operation to be performed, so we concatenate the digits of the numbers obtained from the addition:

The answer is 7. (Note that no further concatenation is needed since only one number, 7, is involved in the problem.)"

systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: Based on the new order of operations PEFMDASC, let's solve the given expression step by step:

1. Parentheses: 
   We have one pair of parentheses in the given expression, i.e., (14 + 4). Therefore, we will evaluate this expression first as per the new order of operations.

2. Inside the parentheses:
   We have addition inside the parentheses, i.e., 14 + 4. We will perform addition before any other operation as per the new order of operations.

3. Addition:
   We will add 14 and 4.

   = 18

4. Prime Factor Counting:
   Since we have only two numbers, i.e., 6 and 18, we will compute the count of unique prime factors shared by them using the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation.

5. Prime Factors of 6: 
   The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.

6. Prime Factors of 18:
   The prime factors of 18 are 2, 2, and 3. Since there are two 2's, we will count them separately.

7. Shared Prime Factors:
   We will count the number of shared prime factors between 6 and 18.

   = 1 (Only one instance of prime factor 2 is shared).

8. Order of Operations:
   Now that we have evaluated the expression inside the parentheses and computed the prime factor count, it's time to apply the other operations in the order specified by the new order of operations.

9. Multiplication and Division (MD):
   Concatenation operation comes before Multiplication and Division in the new order of operations, but there is no multiplication or division here, so we skip this step.

10. Addition and Subtraction (AS):
    Since there is only one addition and one subtraction here, we perform these operations in their given order from left to right.

    First, we will perform addition, i.e., 6 @ 18.

    = 65

    Now, we will perform subtraction, i.e., subtract 2 from 12.

    = 10

11. Concatenation (C):
    Finally, we will perform concatenation, i.e., 65 and 10.

    = 6510

The answer is 6510."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

Given expression: 5 + 3#2

Since prime factor counting operation comes before addition in the order of operations, we need to find the common prime factors between |5| and |3| and |2|.

The prime factors of 5 are 5, since it is a prime number.
The prime factors of 3 are 3, since it is a prime number.
The prime factors of 2 are 2.

Since there is only one common prime factor between 5 and 3 (none with 2), the prime factor counting operation results in 0.

Now we can perform the addition operation with the result of the prime factor counting operation.

1. Parentheses: Solve the expression inside the parentheses first, i.e., 14 + 4:
   = 18

2. Prime Factor Counting (#): Perform the prime factor counting between the digits of the numbers on the right side of the operation (since # is before addition and subtraction in the order of operations):
   = 1 (since there is only one unique prime factor, 2, that appears in the absolute values of 6 and 18, and it appears only once in each number)

3. Multiplication and Division (M/D): Since there is no multiplication or division symbol in the given expression, we can skip this step.

4. Concatenation (C): Carry out the concatenation between the digits of the numbers obtained in step 1:
   = 6 @ 18

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Perform addition and subtraction from left to right:
   = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2
   = 6 @ (18 + 12 - 2)
   = 6 @ (20 - 2)
   = 6 @ 18

6. Finally, perform the concatenation:

According to the order of operations, we need to first evaluate additions and subtractions inside parentheses, then exponents, prime factor counting, multiplication and division, and lastly concatenation.

Since we don't have any addition inside parentheses, we can skip the first P (Parentheses) step.

Now, let's evaluate the additions in the expression. There is only one addition, ""+"", so we apply the A/S rule (Addition and Subtraction).

Our problem: 5 + 2 > 4

With the new order of operations: PEFMDASC, conceptually we have:

1. Concatenation (C) doesn't apply since there are no @ symbol present in the problem.
2. Prime Factor Counting (F) doesn't apply since there are no # symbol present in the problem.
3. Exponents (E) don't apply since there are no exponents in the expression.
4. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Perform the addition (5 + 2), which equals 7.
5. Multiplication and Division (M/D): We don't have any multiplication or division symbols in the problem, so we can skip this step.
6. Concatenation (C) still doesn't apply, so we can move on to the final step.

The answer is: The answer is 7."

Next, we'll apply addition (A) since it has a lower precedence than prime factor counting (F):

(2) Addition: 2 + 6 = 8.

So, the final step is to concatenate (C) the result obtained in the previous step:

In this case, prime factor counting (F) comes before addition and concatenation (A/S and C), so we need to find the prime factors of each number and count the shared prime factors before performing addition and concatenation.

Given: 4 and 3

To find the prime factors of each number:

1. Find the prime factors of 4: 2 x 2 x 2 = 8
2. Find the prime factors of 3: 3

Now, find the number of shared prime factors: Since 8 and 3 do not have any common prime factors, the prime factor counting operation (#) results in 0.

Next, follow the order and perform the addition and concatenation:

Since we've already done prime factor counting, we now perform addition: 0 + 3 = 3

Since we haven't performed concatenation yet, perform that next: Place the digits of 4 and 3 next to each other: 4 _ 3

Since there is no concatenation symbol, we assume it is left to right, resulting in 43.

systemPrompt3_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 5 + 3#2, according to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we should first focus on prime factor counting (F). Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. Evaluate prime factor counting (3#2):
Since 3's prime factors are just 3, and 2's prime factors are 2, there's no shared prime factor in the pair 3 and 2. So, prime factor counting (F) will result in 0.

2. Move on to addition (A):
Now, let's evaluate the addition part of the expression, 5 + 0. Since 0 is the additive identity, the result is going to be the same as the number being added, which is 5.

So, the final answer, according to the PEFMDASC order, is:

The answer is 5."

2. Exponents: None
3. Prime Factor Counting:  Both sides of the expression have the # sign. We will perform Prime Factor Counting (F) operation for each side separately and keep that in mind for the later steps.
   a) For 8 # 2: Prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2, and 2, i.e., four 2s. Prime factors of 2 are all 2, so the number of unique shared prime factors between 8 and 2 is 1.
   b) For 6 # 6: Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Prime factors of 6 itself are repeated; however, since prime factor counting determines the _number_ of shared prime factors, we have 2 shared prime factors here.

Now, we have the information of shared prime factors for each side. Let's proceed with the actual calculations following the order of operations:

1. Prime Factor counting (F): Done
2. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There is no multiplication or division.
3. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We need to add 8 # 2 and 6 # 6. Since we determined that there is one shared prime factor between 8 and 2 and 2 shared prime factors between 6 and 6, we can now add the results of the Prime Factor Counting operations for each side.
