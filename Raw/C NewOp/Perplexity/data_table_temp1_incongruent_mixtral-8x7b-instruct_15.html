There are no parentheses or exponents, so we proceed to Prime Factor Counting (F). We calculate the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 3 and 2. However, since 2 is a prime number, the prime factor of 2 is just 2 itself. Thus, there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2. So, 3 # 2 = 0.<br>3. Now the expression becomes: 5 + 0<br>4.

Parentheses: Calculate the expression within the parentheses first, which is 14 + 4.<br>2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this problem.<br>3.
