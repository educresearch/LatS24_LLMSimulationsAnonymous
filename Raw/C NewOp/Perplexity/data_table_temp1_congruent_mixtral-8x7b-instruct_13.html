      <td>GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Let's solve the expression step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations:<br><br>1. The first operation in the order is Parentheses (P), but there are no parentheses in this expression, so we can move on to the next step.<br>2. The next operation is Exponents (E), but there are also no exponents in this expression, so we can move on to the next step.<br>3. The next operation is Prime Factor Counting (F). However, Prime Factor Counting (F) operates on pairs of numbers, and there is only one number involved in this step (2). Therefore, we can skip this step for now and move on to the next step.<br>4. The next operations are Multiplication and Division (M/D), but there are no multiplication or division operators in this expression. So we can move on to the next step.<br>5. The next operations are Addition and Subtraction (A/S). We have an addition operator (+) in this expression, so we perform the addition first.<br>6. Therefore, we add 5 + 2 to get 7.<br>7. Now, we move on to the Concatenation (C) operation. We have two numbers in the expression, 7 and 4. We concatenate these numbers by joining the digits together.<br>8. Therefore, we concatenate 7 and 4 to get 74.<br>9. The answer is 74.<br><br>So, to summarize:<br><br>* We perform the addition operation first to get 7.<br>* Then, we concatenate the two numbers to get 74.<br><br>The answer is 74.</td>
