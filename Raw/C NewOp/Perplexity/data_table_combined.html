Prime Factor Counting (F):<br>   First, let's calculate the prime factor counts for each number:<br><br>   a) 8 = 2³ &times; 2<br>   b) 2 = 2<br>   c) 6 = 2² &times; 3<br><br>2. Comparing prime factors between numbers:<br>   Since we are calculating the overlap of prime factors between numbers, first find the prime factors common to both 8 and 6:<br><br>   - Common prime factors: 2.<br><br>3. Prime factor count (F) calculation:<br>   The number of unique common prime factors between 8 and 6 is 1 (since there is only one 2 shared). So, 8 # 6 = 1.<br><br>4. Addition (A) and Concatenation (C):<br>   Now, calculate the given expression using the updated order of operations:<br><br>   Since addition (A) comes before concatenation (C), we need to perform the addition (2 + 6) first:<br><br>   a) Addition (A): 2 + 6 = 8<br><br>5. Concatenation (C):<br>   Now that we have the result of the addition, we can perform the concatenation (C):<br><br>   a) Concatenation (C): 1 @ 8 = 18<br><br>The final answer is:<br><br>The answer is 18.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve the problem 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the new operations and order of operations, we need to follow the PEFMDASC rule.<br><br>First, let's deal with the prime factor counting operation (#):<br><br>Since we need to evaluate prime factor counting before addition, we'll find the prime factors for each number first and count how many shared prime factors they have:<br><br>* For 8: Prime factors: 2 &times; 2 &times; 2<br>* For 2: Prime factor: 2<br><br>Both numbers 8 and 2 share 1 prime factor, but since prime factors are unique in this context, this results in a prime factor counting operation of 0.<br><br>Now, let's perform the addition operation (+) with the results:<br><br>8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 0 + 6 # 6 = 6 (since we evaluate prime factor counting before addition)<br><br>Having determined that the prime factor counting operation and the first addition operation come out to be 6, the next operation we need to perform is the last concatenation operation (@).<br><br>Since we need to concatenate the results of the addition operation (6) with the last number (6), we apply the concatenation operation to the result:<br><br>Result = 6 @ 6 = 66<br><br>The final answer, in the form "The answer is __," is:<br><br>The answer is 66.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve the problem with the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), let's follow these steps:<br><br>1. Prime Factor Counting (F):<br>Calculate the prime factor count for each pair:<br>a) 8 and 2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2, 2. The prime factors of 2 are 2. So, the count of shared unique prime factors is 2.<br>b) 2 and 6: The prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 6 are 2, 2, 3. Since there are 2 twos, the count is 1.<br>c) 6 and 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2, 2, 3. Since all are present in both 6s, the count is 3.<br><br>So, the calculation of prime factor counting is: 8 # 2 = 2, 2 # 6 = 1, 6 # 6 = 3.<br><br>2. Concatenation (C):<br>Now, we perform concatenation (the last operation):<br>- 8 # 2 = 2<br>- 2 # 6 = 2<br>- 2 # 6 = 26<br>- The final step is to concatenate the results obtained in the previous steps.<br>- 2 @ 2 @ 26 = 226<br><br>The answer is: The answer is 226.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: To solve the expression 8#2 + 6#6 using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we follow these steps:<br><br>1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Calculate the prime factor count for each term separately.<br>   - For 8#2: The absolute values are |8| = 8 and |2| = 2. Since 8 and 2 share the prime factor 2, the prime factor count is 1.<br>   - For 6#6: The absolute values are |6| = 6 and |6| = 6. Since both 6 and 6 share the prime factors 2 and 3, the prime factor count is 2.<br><br>2. Addition (A): Since we've already performed prime factor counting and not addition, this step is skipped.<br><br>3. Multiplication and Division (M/D): We don't have any multiplication or division in this expression, so this step is skipped.<br><br>4. Exponents (E): We don't have any exponents in this expression, so this step is skipped.<br><br>5. Concatenation (C): Perform the concatenation as the last step.<br>   - 8#2 results in 1 (prime factor count).<br>   - 6#6 results in 2.<br>   - Since we cannot concatenate quantities, we cannot calculate the expression as written. Therefore, the expression "8#2 + 6#6" is undefined with the given new operations.<br><br>So, the final answer for this problem is "undefined."</td>

Since they have a common prime factor 2, the prime factor counting operation (#) is 1.<br><br>2. Concatenation (C):<br>  Concatenating the results of the prime factor counting (F) step, we get 8 and 2. The result of the Concatenation operation (C) is 82.<br><br>3.

      <td>GPT Response: To solve the given expression with the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to identify which operations fall into each category. In this expression, we have prime factor counting (#) and concatenation (@) operations.<br><br>Given expression: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6<br><br>Now, let's apply the order of operations:<br><br>1. Prime Factor Counting (F): We calculate the prime factor counts for each number individually before performing any addition or concatenation.<br><br>a. For 8: The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2, 2.<br>b. For 2: The prime factor of 2 is 2.<br>c. For 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2, 3.<br><br>2. Addition (A): Since there is no explicit parentheses or exponentiation in this expression, we directly evaluate the addition without considering any preceding operations.<br><br>So, now we have 0 + prime factor count of 8 + prime factor count of 6. Based on our examples and calculations above:<br><br>1. Prime factor count of 8: Since the prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2, 2, there is a total of 4 unique prime factors, so prime factor count of 8 is 4.<br>2. Prime factor count of 6: Since the prime factors of 6 are 2, 3, there are 2 unique prime factors, so prime factor count of 6 is 2.<br>3. Addition: Adding the prime factor counts: 4 + 2 = 6.<br><br>So, the final answer is:<br><br>The answer is 6.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve the problem 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 with the new mathematical operations and updated order of operations, we need to follow the PEFMDASC rule:<br><br>1. Parentheses: None in this problem, so we move to the next operation.<br>2. Exponents: None in this problem, so we move to the next operation.<br>3. Prime Factor Counting (F): Since there are no negative numbers or complex expressions, we can directly calculate the prime factor counting operations. We have two pairs of numbers: 8 and 2, and 6 and 6. Let's calculate the prime factor counts for each pair:<br>   a. For 8 and 2, the prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2 (twice), and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since there is at least one shared prime factor, we have 1 for the prime factor count (F) for the first pair.<br>   b. For 6 and 6, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 (twice), and the prime factors of 6 are also 2 and 3 (twice). Since we have two shared prime factors, we have 2 for the prime factor count (F) for the second pair.<br>4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): We don't have any multiplication or division operations, so we move to the next operation.<br>5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Since there are no parentheses or exponents, we can directly perform the addition operation (since prime factor counting is done before addition). We have two addition operations: adding the prime factor counts (F) from each pair and adding the numbers that did not undergo the prime factor counting operation. First, we calculate the prime factor counts for both pairs (1 + 2 = 3 and 0 + 2 = 2), then we add the numbers (8 and 6) that did not undergo the prime factor counting operation.<br>6. Concatenation (C): Since there are no concatenation operations, the solution is the final answer.<br><br>Therefore, the final answer is:<br><br>The answer is 3 + 14 = 17.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem with the updated mathematical operations and order of operations, we first need to apply the prime factor counting operation (#). since 8 and 2 share 2 as a common prime factor, their prime factor counting is 1. For 6 and 6, they also share 2 as a common prime factor, so their prime factor counting is 1 as well. Hence, 8 # 2 = 1 and 6 # 6 = 1.<br><br>Now, we move on to adding the results obtained from the prime factor counting operation. Since 1 + 1 = 2, the final answer is:<br><br>The answer is 2.</td>

Both 2 is present in both prime factorizations.<br>2. No other common prime factors exist.<br><br>Since there is 1 shared prime factor, the result of performing 8 # 6 will be 1.<br><br>Step 2: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)<br>Now, since we have two results of the prime factor counting operation, we'll perform addition between these results: 1 + 1 = 2.<br><br>Finally, we'll add the prime factor counting results to the 6 from the original expression: 1 + 1+ 6 = 8.<br><br>The answer is 8.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem with the new mathematical operations and the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to apply the operations inside the parentheses, which is the addition operation between 14 and 4.<br><br>1. Evaluate the operation inside the parentheses:<br>   Addition (A): 14 + 4 = 18<br><br>2. Apply concatenation (C) to the result obtained from the above step and the number 6.<br>   Concatenation (C): 18 @ 6<br><br>3. The prime factor counting (F) operation cannot be applied yet, as there are no numbers for it to be operated on. Let's continue applying the other operations in the given order of operations.<br><br>4. Apply multiplication (M): Since there is no division in the current expression, we move directly to multiplication. The expression to operate is the result from step 2 and number 12.<br>   Multiplication (M): 6@18 * 12<br><br>5. Perform concatenation (C) operation on the multiplication result and the number -2.<br>   Concatenation (C): (6@18 * 12) @ -2<br><br>6. The first operation to perform is prime factor counting (F) since it comes before exponents (E) and the current expression doesn't have any exponents. We need to find the unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of the concatenation result and number 3.<br>   Since the concatenation result and number 3 are different, and neither has any common prime factors, their prime factorization is 0. This means there are no shared prime factors. Therefore, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 0.<br><br>7. Now that we have obtained the result of the prime factor counting operation, we can continue the order of operations as follows:<br><br>   Subtraction (S): Perform the subtraction between concatenation result (-2) and 0.<br>   Subtraction (S): -2 - 0 = -2<br><br>   Addition (A): (6@18 * 12 @ -2) + (-2)<br>   Addition (A): (6@18 * 12) @ 2 = (654 @ 2) = 6542<br><br>The answer is 6542.</td>

Parentheses: Solve the expression inside the parentheses, 14 + 4 = 18.<br><br>2. Exponents: There are no exponents, so we move on to the next operation.<br><br>3. Prime Factor Counting: We perform prime factor counting on 6 and 18. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 18 are 2 and 2 and 3, so there are 2 unique prime factors common to both: 2. Therefore, 6 # 18 = 2.<br><br>4. Multiplication and Division (left to right): Since there is no multiplication or division, we move on to the next operation.<br><br>5. Addition and Subtraction (left to right): We first perform the subtraction since it is the leftmost operation in the addition and subtraction group. <br><br>   12 - 2 = 10.<br><br>6.

      <td>GPT Response: To solve the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the PEFMDASC order, we will follow these steps:<br><br>1. Prime Factor Counting:<br>   a. For 8 # 2:<br>     * Absolute values of 8 and 2 are 8 and 2 respectively.<br>     * Shared prime factors: None.<br>     * Prime factor counting: 0.<br>   b.

Exponents: There are no exponents in the expression, so we move on to the next operation.<br><br>3. Prime Factor Counting (again): Since we've already calculated the prime factor counting for the individual # operations, we cannot apply this operation to the sum of the results directly. Instead, we calculate the prime factor counting of the prime factor counting results:<br>   * The prime factor counting of 0 and 2 is 2.<br>   * The prime factor counting of 0 and 2 is 2.<br>   * Thus, prime factor counting of 0 + 6 # 6 = 2 + 2 = 4.<br><br>4. Multiplication and Division (MD): There are no multiplications or divisions in this expression, so we move on to the next operation.<br><br>5. Addition and Subtraction (AS): The expression only consists of addition, so we evaluate it in the given order:<br>   * First, we solve addition within the same # sign (i.e., +):<br>     * Add 6 to the result of 6 # 6 (which was calculated earlier to be 2):<br>       6 + 2 = 8<br>    * So far, our intermediate result is 0 (since we did not consider the prime factor counting for the initial 8 # 2) and 8.<br>   * Next, we add the results of the individual # operations:<br>     * 0 + 8 = 8<br><br>6. Concatenation (C): At last, we perform the concatenation operation as the very last step:<br>   * We concatenate 8 (the final result after performing addition) and 4 (the prime factor counting result).<br><br>The answer is 84.</td>

Since we're dealing with concatenation and addition, we'll come back to this step and see how the counts combine.<br>4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): We'll hold off on multiplication since there is no addition and concatenation present that we need to handle first.<br>5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We cannot perform addition before concatenation, so we'll come back to this step once we've combined the concatenation operation with the PM/DAS operations.<br>6. Concatenation (C): To concatenate 6 and (14 + 4), we'll first need to perform the addition inside the parentheses.<br>14 + 4 = 18<br><br>So now, we have the expression 6@18 + 12-2.<br><br>7. Multiplication and Division (M/D): Since there's no multiplication at the moment, we'll move on.<br>8. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Since there's only one subtraction, we can perform it now: 12 - 2 = 10<br>9. Multiplication and Division (M/D): Now, we can perform the multiplication: 6@18 = 618<br><br>Now, we'll return to step 3 to combine the F counts: 1 for the 6 and 14, 1 for the 6 and 4. Since the counts are the same, we have a total prime factor count of 2.<br><br>10. Concatenation (C): Now, we can perform the concatenation: 618.<br><br>So, the final answer is: The answer is 618.</td>

Multiplication: Since there is no multiplication operation in the problem, we can skip this step.<br><br>3. Division: Since there is no division operation in the problem, we can skip this step.<br><br>4. Exponents: There is no exponent in the problem, so we can skip this step.<br><br>5. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in the problem, so we can skip this step.<br><br>6. Concatenation: Next, we perform the concatenation.

Identify prime factor counting (F) operations: Here, we have # sign between the numbers 8 and 2, and the numbers 6 and 6.<br><br>2. Perform prime factor counting (F): For 8 and 2, the prime factors are 2 and 2 (since 2 is the only common prime factor, the prime factor counting value is 2). For 6 and 6, the prime factors are 2 and 2, 2 and 2 (four 2's in total). Since two 2's are shared, the prime factor counting value is 2.<br><br>3. Proceed with the updated order of operations: PEFMDASC:<br>  a. Since we didn't have any parentheses (P) in the expression, we'll move on to the next operation.<br>  b. We've already performed the F (prime factor counting) operation.<br>  c. Since there are neither exponents (E) nor concatenation (C) signs in our expression, we'll skip those operations as well.<br>  d. The next operations in the order are Multiplication and Division (M/D). However, there is no division sign present in our expression.<br>  e. So, we'll just evaluate Multiplication (M) relationships, which mean we need to multiply numbers that are adjacent to each other. Here, we have 8 and # sign, which represents prime factor counting result (2), and then 6 and # sign, which represents prime factor counting result (2). So, the multiplication operation would result in the following: 8 &times; 2 &times; 6 &times; 2, which results in 128. However, we didn't evaluate the addition (+) operation yet.<br>  f. The last operation in our updated order of operations is Addition and Subtraction (A/S), which requires us to evaluate addition before subtraction. So, we need to add 8#2 and 6#6:<br>    1.

Now, since the order of operations demands we evaluate the addition first, we can just add the prime factor counting results:<br>       2 + 2 = 4.<br><br>So, the final answer is:<br><br>The answer is 128 + 4 = 132.</td>

So, the number of unique prime factors shared between 8 and 2 is 1. Hence, 8#2 = 1.<br>   - For 6#6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 x 2 x 3. The prime factors of 6 are also 2 x 2 x 3.

      <td>GPT Response: According to the revised order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to resolve any operations inside parentheses (P). In this case, we have (14 + 4). We perform addition inside the parentheses (M), so we get 18.<br><br>Next, we move on to prime factor counting (F), but since both operands (6 and 18) are single digits, their prime factorizations are already known. The number 6 has a prime factor count of 1 since its only prime factor is 2 (which appears twice), and 18 has a prime factor count of 2 since its prime factorization consists of the prime numbers 2 and 3 (which appear multiple times, thus counted as two). Since 6 and 18 do not share any prime factors, the prime factor counting (#) results in a value of 0.<br><br>Finally, we perform the concatenation (C) operation. We follow the left-to-right concatenation rule, so we first concatenate 6 and the result from prime factor counting (0), getting 6.

Prime factor counting (F):<br>   In this step, we find the prime factor count for each number separately:<br>   a) 8 # 2 = 2 (since prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2, and 2; we have two '2' in common).<br>   b) 6 # 6 = 2 (since prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and we have two '2' in common).<br><br>4. Multiplication and Division (M/D):<br>   We don't have any multiplication or division in this expression. So we move to the next step.<br><br>5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S):<br>   In this step, we add the prime factor counts:<br>   a) 8 # 2 = 2<br>   b) 6 # 6 = 2<br>   c) 2 (from step 3a) + 2 (from step 3b) = 4<br><br>6. Concatenation (C):<br>   Since we don't have any numbers in original form to concatenate, we'll move to the next and final step.<br><br>The answer is: <br><br>The answer is 4.<br><br>We cannot provide an answer with the symbol '@' since the instruction did not ask for a concatenated result. Instead, we can only provide the prime factor counts summation answer.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve the given expression with the new mathematical operations and the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), first, we need to apply prime factor counting (F) to find the unique prime factors common to |8| and |2| and |6| and |6|:<br><br>(1) Prime Factor Counting: 8 # 2 = 2 and 6 # 6 = 2. Since both a and b have the same prime factor 2, the result will be 2 (according to the examples, since there is only 1 shared prime factor 2).<br><br>Next, we'll apply addition (A) since it has a lower precedence than prime factor counting (F):<br><br>(2) Addition: 2 + 6 = 8.<br><br>So, the final step is to concatenate (C) the result obtained in the previous step:<br><br>(3) Concatenation: 8.<br><br>Thus, the answer to the given expression 8#2 + 6#6 is:<br><br>The answer is 88.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the given order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to identify which operation to perform based on the order of precedence:<br><br>1. Parentheses: None<br>2. Exponents: None<br>3. Prime Factor Counting:  Both sides of the expression have the # sign. We will perform Prime Factor Counting (F) operation for each side separately and keep that in mind for the later steps.<br>   a) For 8 # 2: Prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2, and 2, i.e., four 2s. Prime factors of 2 are all 2, so the number of unique shared prime factors between 8 and 2 is 1.<br>   b) For 6 # 6: Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Prime factors of 6 itself are repeated; however, since prime factor counting determines the _number_ of shared prime factors, we have 2 shared prime factors here.<br><br>Now, we have the information of shared prime factors for each side. Let's proceed with the actual calculations following the order of operations:<br><br>1. Prime Factor counting (F): Done<br>2. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There is no multiplication or division.<br>3. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We need to add 8 # 2 and 6 # 6. Since we determined that there is one shared prime factor between 8 and 2 and 2 shared prime factors between 6 and 6, we can now add the results of the Prime Factor Counting operations for each side.<br><br>The answer is: 1 + 2 = 3.<br><br>So, the result of 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the PEFMDASC order is: 3.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Based on the updated order of operations, we need to evaluate prime factor counting before addition. Therefore, let's find the prime factor counting for each number first:<br><br>1. Prime factor counting for 8: Since 8 has prime factors 2 and 2, the number of unique prime factors shared by 8 with itself is 2. Learners may write this as 8 # 8 = 2.<br><br>2. Prime factor counting for 2: Since 2 only has the prime factor 2, the number of unique prime factors shared by 2 with itself is 1.<br><br>3. Prime factor counting for 6: Since 6 has prime factors 2 and 3, the number of unique prime factors shared by 6 with itself is 2.<br><br>Now, let's perform the addition:<br><br>2 (prime factors shared by 8 and itself) + 1 (prime factors shared by 2 and itself) + 2 (prime factors shared by 6 and itself) = 5.<br><br>So, the answer is:<br><br>The answer is 5.</td>

Multiplication and Division (M/D): There are no multiplication or division operations, so we move to the next step.<br>5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We have two addition operations: 8#2 and 6#6. Since we need to evaluate addition from left to right, we will first add 6#6, which is equal to 6 because prime factor counting of 6 is 0. Now, we add 8#2 to 6, which is equal to 8 because prime factor counting of 8 is 1.

      <td>GPT Response: To solve the problem 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the newly introduced order of operations PEFMDASC, follow these steps:<br><br>1. Prime factor counting (F):<br>   First, we perform the prime factor counting operation for each number:<br><br>   a. For 8: 2^3 (three 2s as prime factors)<br>   b. For 2: 2^1 (one 2 as prime factor)<br>   c. For 6: 2^2 * 3^1 (two 2s and one 3 as prime factors)<br><br>2. Prime factor counting (F) for addition:<br>   The prime factor counting of the numbers being added should be done separately in this step:<br><br>   a. The result of 8 # 2 = 0, since there are no shared prime factors between 8 and 2.<br>   b. The result of 6 # 6 = 2, because both numbers have the prime factor 2 in common.<br><br>3. Multiplication and Division (M/D):<br>   Since we have only prime factor counting at this stage, we do not have any multiplication or division operations to perform. If there were any, they would be done at this step in the given order.<br><br>4. Addition and Subtraction (A/S):<br>   In this step, we add the results obtained from the prime factor counting operation in the addition part of the problem:<br><br>   The result of 0 + 2 = 2.<br><br>5. Concatenation (C):<br>   Since we do not have any numbers left to concatenate from the original problem, no further concatenation operations are needed at this point.<br><br>6. Exponents (E):<br>   Since we do not have any exponents in our problem, we can skip this step.<br><br>7. Multiplication and Division (M/D):<br>   We did not have any multiplication or division steps before, so there are no further operations to perform in this step.<br><br>8. Addition and Subtraction (A/S):<br>   We performed the addition step during the prime factor counting phase.

Since there is only one 3, the answer is 1.<br>   c) For 6 and 2, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. The prime factors of 2 are 2. Since both numbers share only one prime factor, the answer is 1.<br><br>4. Multiplication and Division (from left to right):<br><br>   a) Multiply 6 @ 18: With new operations coming before addition or subtraction, we first concatenate 6 and 1 (result is 61) and then concatenate 61 and 18. The final result is 6118.<br>   b) Perform prime factor counting with this result and 3, which we calculated as having a result of 1 earlier. We examined their absolute values, so we take the absolute value of the result, which is 1.<br><br>   = 6118 + 1<br><br>5. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right): Since there's an addition and a subtraction, we'll solve the addition first:<br><br>   = (6118 + 12) - 2<br><br>6. Subtraction: Now we can perform the subtraction:<br><br>   = 6130 - 2<br><br>7. Concatenation: The original expression did not include concatenation with numbers, so in this case, there's no use for it. Thus, the answer is with no concatenation and is 6128.<br><br>So, the final answer is:<br><br>The answer is 6128.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Given mathematical expression is 8 # 2 + 6 # 6. Based on the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to perform prime factor counting (#), then addition (A).<br><br>For the expression 8 # 2, the prime factors common to 8 and 2 are 2.

Sum of these two numbers results in 3.<br><br>So, the final answer is: The answer is 3.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), follow these steps:<br><br>1. Identify and solve any operations inside parentheses (P): In this expression, there are no operations inside parentheses.<br>2. Perform exponentiation (E): In this expression, there is no exponentiation.<br>3. Perform prime factor counting (F): Let's find common prime factors for the absolute values of 8 and 2 (2 and 8) and 6 and 6 (both 2 and 3). Prime factors of 2 are common in both pairs, so their count is 1.<br>   - For 8 and 2: 8 # 2 = 1<br>   - For 6 and 6: 6 # 6 = 1<br>4. Perform division and multiplication from left to right (M/D): In this expression, there is no division or multiplication.<br>5. Perform addition and subtraction from left to right (A/S): In this expression, there are two concatenation operations, but we cannot perform them yet as we still need to complete addition and subtraction. So, let's just move to the next step.<br>    - There is no addition or subtraction in this expression.<br>6. Perform concatenation from left to right (C): Now, we can perform the concatenation operations.<br>   - For 8 # 2: The result of prime factor counting is 1, which does not affect the concatenation of the digits. So, the result is 8 @ 2 = 82.<br>   - For 6 # 6: The result of prime factor counting is 1, which also does not affect the concatenation of the digits. So, the result is 6 @ 6 = 66.<br>7. Combine the results: Since we cannot perform addition between these results directly (we must follow the order), just combine the results and leave the addition for the next step. The combined result is 82 and 66.<br>8. Perform addition and subtraction from left to right (A/S): Now, we can perform the addition operation.<br>   - For 82 and 66: Add the digits one by one in the sequences.<br>      - Carry over 2 from the addition of 2 and 1, making it 3.<br>      - Add 6 and 2, making it 8.<br>      - Add 6 and 8, making it 14. With carries, it becomes 15.<br>      - Subtract 1 (the number of common leading digits) from the final carry number (which is 1), giving us 0.<br>9. Adjust the last step if necessary depending on the number of leading zeroes. Since there are no leading zeroes in our result (15), no adjustments are needed.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 8266.</td>

Multiplication and Division (M/D): The given expression contains an infix operation "@" which represents concatenation, but it looks like an incorrect symbol for multiplication. To resolve this, we should assume it to be addition ("+") or subtraction ("-") instead, as per the traditional mathematical notation. However, since there is no apparent addend or subtrahend, we cannot definitively determine which operation it should be. Therefore, we cannot apply the multiplication and division operation, and we need to move on to the next operation.<br>5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We are unable to determine whether it is an addition or subtraction operation based on the available information.

Concatenation (C): The given expression contains the symbol "@" which represents concatenation. Since the addends for addition or subtractands for subtraction are not provided, we have to assume that the given expression is a concatenation problem. However, since neither of the operands (5 and 2@4) is specified in the form "|a|" and "|b|," we cannot perform concatenation yet. Concatenation is a binary operation and we require two operands to perform it. Let us assume that there was a missing "at-sign" between the numbers in the expression, such as "5 @ 2 @ 4," and we should interpret "2 @ 4" as two separate operands to concatenate with "5" rather than an infix notation for multiplication or subtraction.

Prime factor counting: 8 has prime factors 2 and 2, while 2 has only prime factor 2. Since both numbers have the same prime factor 2, the prime factor counting operation results in a count of 1.<br><br>2. Additionally, since the addition sign (+) is between the two concatenation operations (# and @), we need to perform addition before concatenation:<br><br>   The sum of prime factor counting result (1) and 6 # 6 is the final answer.<br><br>   So, the answer is _____________.<br><br>3.

      <td>GPT Response: To solve the problem, we follow the newly revised order of operations, which is PEFMDASC.

Prime factor counting (F): Since there are no negative numbers or multiplying numbers given, prime factor counting does not apply. We move on to the next operation.<br>2. Multiplication and Division (M/D): None is present in the given expression, we move on to the next operation.<br>3. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): In our given expression, there is an addition sign and two numbers, 5 and 2 @ 4. Since we need to evaluate addition before concatenation, we first find the result of 2 @ 4, which is 24.<br>4. Concatenation (C): Since we have evaluated the addition before concatenation, we can now concatenate the digits of the numbers. In our case, this means placing the digit(s) of the first number before the digit(s) of the second number. So, we concatenate 5 and 24, which gives us 524.<br><br>Therefore, the solution to the given problem, following the newly updated order of operations, is as follows:<br><br>5 + 2 @ 4 = 5 + (2 #### 4) = 5 + 24 = 29 (However, since concatenation is now a left-associative operation and the @ symbol feels redundant, we could also simplify and say that 5 + 24 = 29 directly; thus, the final answer remains the same.)<br><br>So the answer is: 29.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: To solve the problem 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to identify which operations need to be performed before others.<br><br>1. Since # is a prime factor counting operation, it needs to be performed before addition or concatenation.<br>2. Addition and subtraction (A/S) must be performed from left to right, and since there is only addition in this expression, we can proceed with that.<br><br>So, the first step is to perform the additions:<br><br>8 # 2 + 6 # 6<br>--+---------+--<br>2 # 2 + 6 # 6 (since 8 has two prime factors: 2 and 2)<br><br>Now, we can apply the prime factor counting operation to each pair of numbers:<br><br>2 # 2 = 1 (since 2 is a shared prime factor in both 2 and 2)<br>2 + 6 = 4 (no shared prime factors, so the result is simply the sum of the prime factor counts)<br><br>Finally, since concatenation (C) is the last operation to be performed:<br><br>The answer is: 1 @ 4 = 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem based on the new mathematical operations and updated order of operations, we need to follow the order of PEFMDASC:<br><br>1. Prime Factor Counting (#): First, we perform the prime factor counting for each number:<br>   a. For 8: Prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, so # of common prime factors is 2.<br>   b. For 2: It only has one prime factor, 2.<br><br>2. Concatenation (C): Since there is no addition sign and both operands are given, we perform the concatenation next:<br>   8 # 2 = 82<br><br>3. Multiplication and Division (MD): There is no multiplication or division symbol in the expression, so we move on to the next operation.<br><br>4. Addition and Subtraction (AS): Our expression has two addition sign (+) and multiple operands (8, 2, and 6), so we need to follow the rules of adding multiple digits:<br>   a. Adding the first two digits (8 and 2): We get 10, so we add 1 to the next digit (1): The sum is 11 = 1 A (A is the tens digit), and the sum of the ones digits is 2.<br>   b. Adding 1 A (11) and the next number (6): <br>      i. Write down the tens digit of the result (1 A + 6 = 7)<br>      ii. Write the sum of the ones digits: 1 + 1 + 6 = 8<br>      iii. The result has a carry 1 to the hundreds place, so we write down 1 besides the result in step b to show the carry.<br>      iv. Finally, we have the result as: 11 + 6 = 1 A 8 (formally 11A8).<br><br>Since there's no need to evaluate parentheses, exponents, or other unspecified mathematical operations in our example problem, we don't need to apply those operations.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is: The answer is 1A8 (or 118).<br><br>Confidence: 100%</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve the problem 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we follow these steps:<br><br>1. Prime factor counting: <br>We first perform prime factor counting for both 8 and 2, and 6.<br><br>For 8: 2^3 (2 as prime factor multiplicity is 3)<br>For 2: 2^1 (2 as prime factor multiplicity is 1)<br><br>For 6: 2^1, 3^1 (2 and 3 as prime factors each with multiplicity 1)<br><br>Since the only shared prime factor is 2, the prime factor counting is 2.<br><br>2. Multiplication and Division (MD):<br>We do not have any multiplication or division operations in our current expression, so we move on to the next step.<br><br>3. Addition and Subtraction (AS):<br>We need to evaluate the addition operations + inside the # signs.<br><br>The expression becomes: 8 # (2 + 6)<br><br>4. Concatenation (C):<br>Since we have an addition operation inside # symbols, we perform that step first, not concatenation. However, since there are no parentheses involved, we can still proceed as follows.<br><br>We have 2 + 6 = 8, as 4+2=6+2=8.<br><br>So, now our expression is: 8 # 8<br><br>5. Multiplication and Division (MD):<br>Now, since there are no multiplication or division operations left, we move directly to the next operation.<br><br>6. Prime Factor counting (F):<br>As we have already calculated the prime factor counting earlier for 8, we have it as a reference. The only shared prime factor between 8 and 8 is 2, so the prime factor counting is 2.<br><br>7. Exponents (E):<br>There are no exponents in our given expression, so we move to the next operation.<br><br>8. Concatenation (C):<br>Now, we perform concatenation operation. Concatenating 2 (the result of prime factor counting) and 2 (from the previous step), we get 22 as our final answer.<br><br>Thus, the final answer is: The answer is 22.</td>

Determine the order of operations: According to the updated order of operations, we should perform prime factor counting before addition.<br>3. Perform the prime factor counting operation:<br>   The given numbers are 3 and 2. To find their prime factor commonality (#), we need to find the prime factors of both numbers and count how many of them are common.

For 8 and 2: The prime factors of 8 are 2³ and 2, so the count is 2. Prime factors of 2 are 2 itself, so twice the count for 2 is 2 as well.

Since 3 is a common prime factor between 6 and 3, their prime factor counting is 1.<br><br>3. Multiplication and Division (MD): There are no multiplication or division operations, so we move on to the next operation.<br><br>4. Addition and Subtraction (AS): We now perform addition and subtraction from left to right, beginning with the + sign between 6 and the result of the parentheses.<br>   6 @ 18 + 12 = 6 @ 24 = 624<br><br>5. Concatenation (C): The last operation to perform is the concatenation.<br>   The answer is 624.<br><br>So, the final answer is: The answer is 624.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Based on the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), prime factor counting should be performed before addition. <br><br>Therefore, we first calculate the prime factor counts for 8 and 2:<br>8 = 2³ x 2⁴<br>2 = 2⁴<br><br>Since 2 is the only shared prime factor between 8 and 2, the prime factor count is 1.<br><br>So, the solution to the problem 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 is:<br><br>1 (prime factor count of 8 and 2) + 1 (prime factor count of 6 and 6) = 2.<br><br>The answer is 2.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Based on the newly updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to first perform the prime factor counting operation. Here, the prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since there are no shared prime factors between the absolute values of 8 and 6, the prime factor counting operation results in 0.<br><br>Now, since addition comes before prime factor counting in the new order, we can perform the addition operation: 0 + 6 = 6.<br><br>The answer is 6.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve the given problem with the new mathematical operations and order of operations, follow these steps:<br><br>1. Identify the prime factor counting (#) operations and perform them first, since they have precedence over other operations according to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC).<br><br>2. In this problem, there are two prime factor counting operations: 8#2 and 6#6. Let's calculate the results of these operations:<br><br>   - For 8#2: The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since there are two shared prime factors (2), the result of 8#2 is 2.<br>   - For 6#6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3, the result of 6#6 is 0.<br><br>   Now, we have the results of prime factor counting operations: 2 and 0.<br><br>3. Perform the addition operation using these results since the addition operation has higher precedence than concatenation (which is the next operation) in the order of operations.<br><br>4. The addition operation here is 2 + 0, which equals 2.<br><br>5. Finally, since we have already performed the prime factor counting and addition operations, there is only the concatenation operation left to perform. Since the concatenation operation has the lowest precedence in the updated order of operations, we perform it last.<br><br>6. Concatenating the digits of 2 and 6, we get the final answer: 26.<br><br>So, the updated answer to this problem, considering the new mathematical operations and order of operations, is:<br><br>The answer is 26.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)<br><br>To calculate 8 # 2 and 6 # 6, we first need to find the prime factors of both numbers and count the number of unique shared prime factors.<br><br>Prime factors of 8: 2, 2, 2, 2<br>Prime factors of 2: None<br>Shared prime factors: 0<br><br>Prime factors of 6: 2, 2, 3<br>Prime factors of 2: 2<br>Shared prime factors: 1<br><br>So, 8 # 2 = 0 and 6 # 6 = 1, according to the definition of prime factor counting operation.<br><br>Step 2: Addition (A)<br><br>Since the addition symbol is present after counting prime factors, we need to perform addition.<br><br>0 + 1 = 1<br><br>Therefore, the answer is:<br><br>The answer is 1.</td>
