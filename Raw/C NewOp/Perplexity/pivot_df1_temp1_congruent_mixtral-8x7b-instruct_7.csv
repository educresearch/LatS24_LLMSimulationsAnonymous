mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC).

First, there are no parentheses or exponents in this problem, so we move on to the next operation, which is prime factor counting (F). However, there are no absolute values or negative numbers in this problem, so we can skip prime factor counting and go to the next operation, which is multiplication and division (M and D). Still, there are no multiplication or division signs, so we continue to addition and subtraction (A and S). Here, we encounter the concatenation operation (C). According to the new order, we should evaluate concatenation after addition and subtraction. Since there is no addition or subtraction to be done in this problem, we can proceed with concatenation.

So, we concatenate 2 and 4:

2 @ 4 = 24

Finally, we have:

5 + 24

Since addition comes before multiplication and division in the order of operations, we perform the addition last:

5 + 24 = 29

The answer is 29."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations, we first need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F) before addition.

8 # 2 = 2 (since the prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 2 are 2, so there is one shared prime factor, 2)

6 # 6 = 1 (since the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 6 are also 2 and 3, so there is one shared prime factor, 2 and 3)

Now that we have evaluated the prime factor counting operation, we can proceed to addition.

2 + 1 = 3

Therefore, the answer is 3."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we must follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), which means we should first perform Prime Factor counting (F), then Exponents (E, if any), Multiplication/Division (M,D), Addition/Subtraction (A,S), and finally Concatenation (C). 

Based on this order, the given expression 4 # 3+2 would first perform the Prime Factor counting operation (F) on the integer 4, which results in 1 (since 4 only has one unique prime factor, 2). The rest of the expression, 3+2, would then be calculated, which is 5.

Therefore, the answer is 1, which is the result of the Prime Factor counting operation followed by the Addition operation.

Next, we do concatenation:

186 + 12 - 2 # 3

198 - 2 # 3

Lastly, we do addition and subtraction from left to right:

196 - 1

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the new order of operations PEFMDASC, which includes Prime Factor Counting (F) before Addition and Subtraction (A/S).

So,

8 # 2 + 6 # 6

First, perform Prime Factor Counting (F) on 8 and 2:

8 = 2^3, so it has 1 unique prime factor (2)
2 = 2^1, so it has 1 unique prime factor (2)

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Let's solve the problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations, while highlighting the use of the new operations.

1. Calculate the prime factor counting operation (F): 8 # 2
First, we need to find the prime factors of 8 and 2. The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 2 are simply 2. Since the only shared prime factor is 2, the prime factor counting operation (F) is 1.
2. Calculate the prime factor counting operation (F): 6 # 6
Now, let's find the prime factors of 6 and 6. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 6 are again 2 and 3. Here, we have 2 shared prime factors (2 and 3), so the prime factor counting operation (F) is 2.
3. Perform addition operation (A): 1 + 2 (from steps 1 and 2)
The result of the prime factor counting operations from the previous steps is 1 + 2, which equals 3.

The answer is 3.

Here's a quick summary of the steps we followed:

1. 8 # 2 = 1 (Prime Factor Counting operation)
2. 6 # 6 = 2 (Prime Factor Counting operation)

The answer is 3."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: Step 1: According to the order of operations, we first evaluate the expression in parentheses. 
14 + 4 = 18

Step 2: Now, we perform the Concatenation operation on 6 and 18.
6 @ 18 = 618

Step 3: The next operation in the expression is Addition. We add 618 (the result from Step 2) and 12.
618 + 12 = 630

Step 4: Now, we perform the Prime Factor Counting operation on 3 and 2 (the result from Step 3 minus 2 from the original expression).
3 has a prime factor of 3, and 630 has prime factors of 2, 3, 3, 5, and 35. Since 3 is a shared prime factor of both numbers, F = 1.

So, the expression becomes 630 # 3 = 1.

Step 5: Finally, we perform the Subtraction operation on 630 (the result from Step 3) and 1 (the result from Step 4).
630 - 1 = 629

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to solve the problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations!

1. First, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F) between 3 and 2:

3 # 2 = 0

This is because the prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since they don't have any common prime factors, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 0.

2. Next, we move on to addition (A):

5 + 0

Now, we add the result from step 1 (0) to 5:

5 + 0 = 5

3. Since there are no further operations left, the final answer is 5.
