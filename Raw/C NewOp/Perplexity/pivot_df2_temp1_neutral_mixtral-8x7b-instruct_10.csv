First, let's find the prime factors of 4 and 3:

4 = 2^2 (two 2's)
3 = 3 (no repeats)

They share no prime factors, so 4 # 3 = 0.

Prime factor counting of 3 and 2 is:
3 has prime factors of 3 only, and
2 has prime factors of 2 only.

Since there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, the prime factor counting (F) of 3 and 2 is 0.

The expression is: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses
Evaluate the expression within the parentheses first, which is 14 + 4.

14 + 4 = 18

So, the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Concatenation (C)
