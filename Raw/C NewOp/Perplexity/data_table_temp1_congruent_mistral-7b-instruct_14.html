      <td>5 + 3#2</td>
      <td>GPT Response: The given expression is "5 + 3#2". Based on the expanded order of operations PEFMDASC, the solution would be as follows:<br><br>1. Prime Factor Counting (F): We first perform the prime factor counting operation on the number 2. The prime factors of 2 are 2 itself.<br>2. Prime Factor Counting (F) for the expression '3#2': Since the prime factor counting operation is commutative and associative, we can apply it to each number separately and then compare their results to find the shared prime factors. The prime factors of 3 are 3, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, the prime factor counting operation results in 0.<br>3. Since the addition sign (+) is present between 5 and the result of the prime factor counting operation (3#2), we need to evaluate the addition before prime factor counting. Therefore, the addition sign (+) between 5 and 0 is evaluated as follows:<br>   5 + 0 = 5.<br><br>So, the solution to the given expression '5 + 3#2' is 5.<br><br>The answer is 5.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve the problem 5 + 3#2, we need to follow the new order of operations: PEFMDASC. Since there are no parentheses or exponents in this expression, we can skip those steps.<br><br>1.

So, 3#2 = 1.<br><br>2. Multiplication and Division (M/D): Since there is no multiplication or division in this problem, we can skip this step.<br><br>3. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Now, we can perform the addition:<br>   So, 5 + 1 = 6<br><br>Therefore, the final answer is: "The answer is 6."</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve the problem 5 + 3#2, we need to follow the updated order of operations, PEFMDASC:<br><br>1.

Addition (A): Now, we add 5 and 1, which results in 6.<br><br>So, the answer is: The answer is 6.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 3#2 using the PEFMDASC order, we follow these steps:<br><br>1. Prime Factor Counting (F): First, we need to find the prime factor count of the numbers 3 and 2 using their absolute values:<br>   - Prime factors of 3: 3<br>   - Prime factors of 2: 2<br>2. Prime Factor Counting (F): Next, we calculate the prime factor count shared between 3 and 2, which is 1.<br>3. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Since there's no multiplication or division in this part of the expression, we proceed directly to addition:<br>   - Add the sum of the numbers given: 5 + 3 = 8<br>4. Concatenation (C): Since there's no operators preceding concatenation in the expression, we perform concatenation on the final result (8):<br>   - Concatenation of 8 and an empty string (since we're concatenating 8 with something): 8<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 8.</td>
