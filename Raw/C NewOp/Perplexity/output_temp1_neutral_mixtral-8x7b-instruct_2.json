Let's solve this problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations:\n\n1. Prime Factor Counting (F): There are no exponents or multiplication/division to evaluate first, so we start with the prime factor counting operation. The prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, the result of 3 # 2 is 0.\n2. Addition (A): Now, we move on to addition. We already have the result from step 1, which is 0. So there is nothing left to add at this point.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 0."}]}]
