Given expression: 5 + 2@4

Since ""@"" is the concatenation operation, which comes after addition in the given order of operations, we need to first perform the addition operation.

5 + 2 = 7

Now that we have the value of the addition, we can perform the concatenation operation. Since both operands are single digits, we simply concatenate them to get:

7@4 = 74

So, the answer is 74.

The answer is 74."

1. Find the prime factors for |8| which is 2³ and |2|, same for |6| which is 2 × 3. Since both numbers share the prime factor 2, the prime factor counting operation # results in 1. So 8 # 2 = 2 # 6 = 1.

The prime factor counting has been completed, so the next operation is multiplication and division (M and D). Since we don't have any exponents, multiplication or division, we move on to the next operation, addition and subtraction (A and S).

However, there are no addition or subtraction signs in our given expression, so the only remaining operation is concatenation (C). Since we don't have any parentheses or exponents either, we follow the left-to-right rule for concatenation and join the digits of 8 (1000) and 2 (0010) to get 1000010 for the final answer.

Since the order of operations has been expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, we need to follow the new sequence:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Prime Factor Counting
4. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
5. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)
6. Concatenation

In the given expression, there are no parentheses, exponents, or concatenation involved. However, there are prime factor counting and addition.

First, let's examine the prime factor counting operation (#). To perform this operation, we need to identify the unique prime factors shared by the numbers being compared.

The prime factors of 5 are 5.
The prime factors of 3 are 3.
The prime factors of 2 are 2.

Since there is only one number (2) that is a prime factor for both 5 and 3, the prime factor counting operation (#) results in 1.

Now, let's evaluate the addition operation (+):

The sum of 5 and the result of 3 # 2 (which is 1) is:

However, in this specific problem, none of the numbers involve any negative signs or exponents, so both prime factor counting and addition can be directly applied to the given numbers. In this case, we don't need to apply parentheses, exponents, or multiplication/division since they are not involved in the given operation.

Given expression: 4#3 + 2

First, calculate prime factor counting for 4 and 3:
- Prime factors of 4: 2, 2
- Prime factors of 3: 3

Since there's only one common prime factor (2), the prime factor counting result is 1.

Next, perform the addition:
1 (from prime factor counting) + 2 = 3

So, the final answer is: The answer is 3."

systemPrompt3_userPrompt2_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations, PEFMDASC. Since there are no parentheses, we begin with prime factor counting (F).

First, let's find the prime factors of 8 (2² × 2³) and 2 (2), then compare them:

8 # 2 = 1 (since there's only one prime factor '2' in 8 and no common prime factors in 2)

Now, we move on to the addition (A). Since there's only one addition sign, we don't need to worry about evaluating addition from left to right. So, we can proceed to the next operation, which is concatenation (C).

Since there's only one concatenation sign, and no parentheses, we can execute concatenation last.

So, the steps are as follows:

1. Prime factor counting (8 # 2): 1
2. Concatenation: Since there is no operation left, we'll have the final result as 1.

The answer is 1."

To solve the problem, we need to apply the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. Parentheses: None in this problem
2. Exponents: None in this problem
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): 3 and 2 are integers, and their prime factorizations are 3 = 3 and 2 = 2. W▓e have one common prime factor (2), so 3 # 2 = 1.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): None in this problem
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We first need to perform the prime factor counting (step 3) for the given integers. So, 3 # 2 = 1.
    Now, we can perform the addition: 5 + 1 = 6.

Therefore, The answer is 6."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

1. First, we focus on the symbol '@' which represents concatenation. In this case, we have the digit 2 being concatenated with the digit string 4. So, we need to perform this operation before any other operation.

2. Concatenation of the digit 2 and the digit string 4: 2@4 = 24.

Now we have the expression: 5 + 24

3. Follow the order and process the '+' sign which represents addition.

   Now, let's perform the addition:
   - The sum of 1 (prime factor count) and 2 is 3.

The answer is 3."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

In the given input, we have addition (A) and prime factor counting (F). Since prime factor counting has a higher priority than addition, we will perform prime factor counting first.

Step 2: Perform the prime factor counting operation. Since there is only one prime factor shared between 3 and 2, let's denote it as p, the prime factor.

3 has the prime factors 3
2 has the prime factors 2

Since both 3 and 2 share the prime factor '2', we have 1 unique prime factor shared between them.

Step 3: Perform the addition operation using the result of the prime factor counting step.
