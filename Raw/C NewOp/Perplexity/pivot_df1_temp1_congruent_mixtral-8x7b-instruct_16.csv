mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC). According to this order, we should perform prime factor counting (F) before addition or subtraction (A or S). Therefore, we first find the prime factor counting of 8 and 2, as well as 6 and 6.

The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Hence, they share one prime factor, so 8 # 2 = 1.

Similarly, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 6 are all 2, 3. Hence, they share two prime factors, so 6 # 6 = 2.

Now, we can perform the addition:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 2 = 3

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: For the expression 8#2 + 6#6, we need to follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC). According to this order, we should perform Prime Factor Counting (F) before Addition (A).

First, let's calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) for 8#2:

The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2.
The prime factors of 2 are 2.
Since these expressions share 1 prime factor (2), 8#2 equals 1.

Next, let's calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) for 6#6:

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
These expressions share 2 prime factors (2 and 3), so 6#6 equals 2.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Let's solve this step by step using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. There are no Parentheses, Exponents, nor Prime Factor counting (F) in the expression, so we move on to Multiplication and Division (M/D). However, there are no multiplication or division operations in this expression. So, we move on to the next step.
2. We now look for Addition and Subtraction (A/S) operations. There is an addition operation in the given expression: 5 + 2. We perform this operation first:

5 + 2 = 7

1. After performing the addition, we now have the original expression with only the Concatenation (C) operation remaining:

7 @ 4

Concatenation (C) means joining the digits of the two numbers together. In this case, we simply attach the digit 4 to the number 7, since there is no digit to be attached to the right side of 4.

7 @ 4 = 74

Therefore, the answer is 74."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: Let's solve this problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations with the provided new operations.

Given expression: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

First, we need to perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation as it has a higher precedence than addition:

The prime factors of 8 are 2 * 2 * 2, so there are 1 unique prime factor (counting multiplicity once).
Hence, 8 # 2 = 1.

The prime factors of 6 are 2 * 3, so there is 1 unique prime factor.
Hence, 6 # 6 = 1.

Now, replace the Prime Factor Counting parts of the original expression with their results:

1 + 1

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: Step 1: Follow the order of operations and perform the operation inside the parentheses first.
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2

Step 2: Perform the Concatenation operation (C).
(Note: Concatenation is done from left to right.)

6 @ 18 = 618
So, 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 = 618 + 12 - 2

Step 3: Perform the Addition and Subtraction operations (A/S).
(Note: They are performed from left to right.)
618 + 12 - 2 = 630 - 2

Step 4: Continue with the Addition and Subtraction operations (A/S).
630 - 2 = 628

Step 5: The final step is to perform the Prime Factor Counting operation (F) with #.
However, there are no instances of the Prime Factor Counting operation (#) in the given expression. So, you don't need to perform any further calculations.

The answer is 628."
