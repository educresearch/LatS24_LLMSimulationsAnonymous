Parentheses:\n   First, we need to resolve the expression inside the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18.\n\n2. Exponents:\n   There are no exponents.\n\n3. Prime Factor counting (#):\n   Let's find the unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of each term, considering them one at a time.\n\n   a. For 18: The prime factors of 18 are 2, 2, 3, 3. Since there are no shared prime factors, we record this result as 0.\n\n   b. For 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2, 2, 3. Shared prime factors with 18 are 2, so the prime factor count is 2.\n\n   c. For 12: The prime factors of 12 are 2, 2, 2, 3, 7. No shared prime factors with 18 or 6, making the prime factor count 0.\n\n   d. For -2: Since the number is negative, we take the absolute value, which gives 2. The prime factors of 2 are 2 itself, so the prime factor count here is 1.\n\n4. Multiplication and Division (M/D):\n   This step involves performing multiplication and division operations, but there is no multiplication or division in our expression. Therefore, we skip this step.\n\n5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S):\n   Since our expression has only addition and subtraction operators, we will handle them next.\n\n   a. For concatenation: Since we've encountered subtraction earlier in the expression, we first evaluate subtraction before concatenation operators. The expression is 6 @ (18 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3.\n\n   b. First, perform the addition inside the parentheses: 18 + 4 = 22.\n\n   c. Now concatenate the numbers: 6 @ 22 = 622.\n\n   d. Perform the subtraction: 622 - 2 = 620.\n\n   e. Lastly, perform the prime factor counting as we've previously calculated and recorded above.\n\n5. Concatenation (C):\n   As we've already performed the concatenation in step 5e, there's no need for additional work here.\n\nThe answer is 620."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700", "model": "mistral-7b-instruct", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 700, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "Introduction to New Mathematical Operations and Updated Order of Operations\n\n                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.\n\n                    New Operations:\n                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. \n                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):\n                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.\n                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.\n                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.\n                    \n                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. \n                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):\n                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1\n                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) \n                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. \n                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)\n                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. \n                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)\n                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.\n                    It's crucial to get this right for accurate calculations.\n                    \n                    Revised Order of Operations: PEFMDASC\n                    P: Parentheses\n                    E: Exponents\n                    F: Prime Factor counting\n                    M/D: Multiplication and Division (left to right)\n                    A/S: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)\n                    C: Concatenation (left to right)\n                    \n                    Important Examples Demonstrating New Operations and Order:\n                    (i) 5 @ 3 + 6\n                    = 5 @ 9 (since we need to evaluate addition before concatenation)\n                    = 59\n\n                    (ii) 5 # 3 + 6\n                    = 0 + 6 (since we need to evaluate prime factorization before addition)\n                    = 6\n\n                    (iii) 5 - 3 @ 6\n                    = 2 @ 6 (since we need to evaluate subtraction before concatenation)\n                    = 26\n\n                    (iv) 5 - 3 # 6\n                    = 5 - 1 (since we need to evaluate prime factorization before subtraction)\n                    = 4\n\n                    (vi) (3 + 10 # 2) * 5 @ 42 \n                    = (3 + 1) * 5 @ 42 (we need to evaluate what is in the parenthesis first and prime factor counting is before addition)\n                    = 4 * 5 @ 42  (we need to evaluate multiplication before concatenation\n                    = 20 @ 42 = 2042.
