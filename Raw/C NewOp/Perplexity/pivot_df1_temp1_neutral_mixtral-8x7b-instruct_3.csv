According to this order, we need to perform prime factor counting before addition. Therefore, we first calculate 2 @ 4:

2 @ 4 = 24

Now that we have evaluated the concatenation operation, we can move on to addition:

5 + 24 = 29

8 # 2 + 6 # 6

First, we perform the prime factor counting operation (F):

Prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2.
Prime factors of 2 are 2.
Shared prime factor is 2. So, 8 # 2 = 1.

Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
Shared prime factors are 2 and 3. So, 6 # 6 = 2.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: To solve the expression using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we start by simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we perform the Prime Factor counting (F) between 2 and 3, which is 0 since they don't share any prime factors:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Now, we concatenate (C) 6 and 18, which gives us 618:

618 + 12 - 0

Then, we perform addition (A) and subtraction (S) from left to right:

630 - 0

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we start by performing the operation that comes first based on the order.

5 + 3 # 2

Here, the operation # (prime factor counting) has higher precedence than the addition operation (+). So, we first calculate 3 # 2.

The prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. They don't have any common prime factors, so their prime factor counting is 0.

Now, replace 3 # 2 with 0 in the original expression:

5 + 0

Next, let's find the prime factors of the absolute values of 6 and 6:

Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.

Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.

Since 2 and 3 are shared prime factors, we have:

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
The prime factors of 3 are 3.

Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, the prime factor counting is 0.

1. Parentheses: Calculate the expression within the parentheses first: 14 + 4 = 18.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this problem, so we can proceed to the next operation.
3. Prime Factor counting (F): We have a prime factor counting operation (#) involving 2 and 3. Calculate this next. However, it is easier to do this part at the end. So, for now, leave it as 2 # 3 and remember that the solution to this part will be 0.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There are no multiplication or division operations in this problem, so we can proceed to the next operation.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Now, calculate the addition and subtraction operations from left to right.
a. Calculate the concatenation (C) part: 6 @ 18.

b. After performing the concatenation, continue to the subtraction: The result from 5a (6 @ 18) minus 12.

1. Finally, get the solution of the prime factor counting (F) that was left from step 3: 0.

Now, perform the operations step by step:

6 @ 18 = 618
618 - 12 = 606

First, let's find the prime factor counting of 8 and 2:
- Prime factors of 8 are 2 * 2 * 2, so there is 1 unique prime factor 2.
- Prime factors of 2 are just 2 itself, so there is 1 unique prime factor 2.
Since there is only one shared prime factor 2, 8 # 2 equals 1.

Next, let's find the prime factor counting of 6 and 6:
- Prime factors of 6 are 2 * 3, so there are 2 unique prime factors 2 and 3.
- Prime factors of 6 are also 2 * 3, so there are 2 unique prime factors 2 and 3 as well.
Since there are 2 shared prime factors 2 and 3, 6 # 6 equals 2.

1. **Parentheses:** Calculate the expression within the parentheses first: 14 + 4 = 18.

So we have 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3.

1. **Exponents:** There are no exponents in this expression.

So we move to the next step.

1. **Prime Factor counting (F):** Evaluate the shared prime factors between 6 @ 18 and 2 in 2 # 3. We don't know the result of 6 @ 18 yet, so let's calculate that first.

1. **Concatenation (C):** Perform the concatenation operation first because it is higher in the order of operations. Concatenate 6 with 18: 6 @ 18 = 618.

Now, we move back to step 3 and do the Prime Factor counting (F).

1. **Prime Factor counting (F):** Count the unique prime factors shared between 618 and 2. Since 618 is not a prime number, it doesn't reshare a factor with 2. So, 618 # 2 = 0 (no shared prime factor).

Now, we move to the next step.

1. **Multiplication and Division (MD):** Neither are present in this expression.

1. **Addition and Subtraction (AS):** Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.

618 + 12 - 2 # 3 = 630 - 2 # 3 (from left to right). Now, perform the subtraction operation first.

628 # 3 = 4 (since the only shared prime factors are 2 and 3).
