Prime Factor Counting (F): Calculate the prime factor count of 3 and 2. Since 3 has only one unique prime factor 3 and 2 has only one prime factor 2, the result of this step is 1.\n\n2. Concatenation (C): Since this operation comes after prime factor counting in the order of operations, we next concatenate the results of the prime factor counting step. However, since the result of step 1 is a number (1), and concatenation is a mathematical operation that combines digits, we cannot perform concatenation directly on it. Instead, we include a placeholder '0' to the left of the number obtained in step 1, and perform concatenation on the digits of the resulting number.\n\nSince there is only one digit in the number obtained in step 1, there is no need to add a zero beforehand. So, we have:\n-- Current result: 1\n\n3. Addition/Subtraction (A/S): Now, we perform the addition part of this step. Since '+' is included in the Addition/Subtraction category in the order of operations, we add the numbers 5 and the result of the previous step (1).\n\nThe current result: 1\nAdd 5: 1 + 5 = 6\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\nThe answer is 6."}]}]
