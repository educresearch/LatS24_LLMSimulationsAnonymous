      <td>GPT Response: To solve the given expression 4 # 3 + 2, we need to follow the newly introduced order of operations, PEFMDASC:<br><br>1. Parentheses: None present in the expression, so we move on to the next operation.<br>2. Exponents: None present in the expression, so we move on to the next operation.<br>3. Prime Factor Counting: Since we have two numbers, 4 and 3, we need to find the number of unique prime factors they share. Here's a quick check: Prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and prime factors of 3 are 3. We have 1 shared prime factor, 2, that appears twice. So, 4 # 3 = 1 * 2 * 1 = 2.<br>4. Multiplication and Division: Since there's no multiplication or division in the given expression, we move on to the next operation.<br>5. Addition and Subtraction: We need to evaluate the addition operation now: 2 + 2 = 4.<br>6.
