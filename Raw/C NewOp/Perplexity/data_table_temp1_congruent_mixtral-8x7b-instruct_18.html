The intent here is to demonstrate the use of the new operations within the new order of operations, but you should be aware of potential discrepancies in the final answer when comparing to traditional methods. The answer based on the PEFMDASC order of operations and new mathematical operations is 29, while the answer using the traditional PEMDAS and without the new operations is 11.</td>

Parentheses: Calculate the expression within the parentheses first, 14 + 4 = 18.<br>2.

Now our expression looks like this: 618 + 10 # 3.<br>7. Back to step 5, the remaining operation is 10 # 3, which is equal to 1 (since the only shared prime factor of 10 and 3 is 1).
