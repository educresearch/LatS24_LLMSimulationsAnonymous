llama-2-70b-chat,1,700,systemPrompt4,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

Step 1: Evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation.

8 # 2 = 8 # 2 = 4 (since the prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 1, and the prime factors of 2 are 2 and 1, so there are 4 shared prime factors)

6 # 6 = 6 # 6 = 1 (since the prime factors of 6 are 2, 3, and 1, and the prime factors of 6 are 2, 3, and 1, so there is only 1 shared prime factor)

Step 2: Evaluate the Concatenation (C) operation.

8 @ 2 = 8 @ 2 = 16 (since the digits of 8 and 2 are concatenated to form 16)

6 @ 6 = 6 @ 6 = 36 (since the digits of 6 and 6 are concatenated to form 36)

Step 3: Evaluate the Addition (A) operation.

16 + 36 = 52

Step 4: Evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation again.

52 # 6 = 52 # 6 = 2 (since the prime factors of 52 are 2, 2, 3, 3, and 1, and the prime factors of 6 are 2, 3, and 1, so there are 2 shared prime factors)

Step 5: Evaluate the Concatenation (C) operation again.

52 @ 6 = 52 @ 6 = 324 (since the digits of 52 and 6 are concatenated to form 324)

The answer is 324."
