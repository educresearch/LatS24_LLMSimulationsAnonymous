systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

1. Identify the new operations: In this expression, we have Concatenation (C), represented as @.
2. Determine the order: According to the revised order of operations, Concatenation (C) should be performed after Addition/Subtraction (A/S), which is step 7. However, in this case, there are no Addition or Subtraction operations, so Concatenation will not be performed. It remains 5 + 2 @ 4.
3. Perform the other operations in order: Since there are no other operations besides Addition and Concatenation, we don't need to proceed with steps 3-6.

The answer is 7.

Notes:

* We didn't need to perform concatenation since it's only applicable when both numbers are non-negative integers and it should be performed after all other arithmetic operations, but we don't have any such scenario here.
* There were no multiplication, division, exponents, or parenthesis, so they didn't play any role in solving this expression."

                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

1. First, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F), which is # in this expression. The operands are 3 and 2. The prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, # will result in 0.

So, 3 # 2 = 0.

2. Next, we move to the addition operation (A), which is the first operation on the left of the expression after evaluating the prime factor counting operation in the previous step. The operands are 5 and 0 (from the previous step).

So, 5 + 0 = 5.

Updated Order of Operations with New Operations

The field of mathematics has evolved with the introduction of two new operations, concatenation (C) and prime factor counting (F), and as a result, the order of operations has been updated to PEFMDASC. This article presents examples that illustrate the application of these new operations and their placement in the revised order of operations.

Concatenation (C)
Concatenation is denoted by @ and represents the operation of joining the digits of two numbers together. When using concatenation, one does not consider the signs of the numbers involved, and instead focuses on the absolute values. Here are some examples:

* If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
* If a = 12 and b = -56, then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
* If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

Prime Factor Counting (F)
Prime Factor Counting is denoted by # and calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of two numbers. Here are some examples:

* If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1, since the prime factors of 12 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 56 are 2 and 7, resulting in one shared prime factor, 2.
* If a = -16 and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1, since the prime factors of 16 are 2 and the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 5, resulting in one shared prime"
