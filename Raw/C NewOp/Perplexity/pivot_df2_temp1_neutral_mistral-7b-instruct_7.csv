mistral-7b-instruct,1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F), then addition (S).

Given expression: 4 # 3 + 2

First, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F):

4 # 3 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor between 4 and 3 is 2, but it is counted only once for each number)

Now, we have 1 + 2:

Addition (S):

Final answer: The answer is 1 + 2 = 3.","GPT Response: To solve the given expression 4 # 3 + 2 according to the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to evaluate prime factor counting (F) operation. In this expression, only the first number 4 has a prime factor counting operation with another number (3). Let's calculate the prime factor count for 4 and 3 separately.

The prime factors for 4: 2 and 2
The prime factors for 3: 3

Since there is only 1 prime factor (number 2) that is common between the two numbers, the prime factor counting operation results in a value of 1.

Now, we move on to the concatenation (C) operation since it is next in the order of operations. In this expression, the # and @ operations are applied to the numbers 4 and 3, so we'll get the results of these operations and then concatenate them.

4 # 3 = 1 (from above calculation)
1 @ 3 = 13 

The solution is 13.

So, the answer is 13.","GPT Response: The given expression is ""4 # 3 + 2."" Based on the updated order of operations, we first need to perform prime factor counting between 4 and 3. Since there are no shared prime factors between the two numbers, the prime factor count is 0.

According to the order of operations, we then perform addition before concatenation. Since 0 is the identity element for addition, the expression simplifies to 2.

Finally, since concatenation is the last operation, we perform this operation on the 2 that remains after addition. Since there is no number for concatenation in our expression, we cannot apply the @ (concatenation) symbol. Therefore, the final answer should be simply ""The answer is 2.""","GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the revised order of operations PEFMDASC, follow these steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
 Find the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of the operators and operands, word by word from left to right.
 Here, we have 4, #, 3, and 2.
 Since there are no shared prime factors, the result is 0 for each prime factor counting operation: 4 # 3 = 0, # 3 = 0, and 3 # 2 = 0.

2. Exponents (E):
 There are no exponents present in the expression.

3. Multiplication and Division (M/D):
 We don't have any multiplication or division operations in the given expression.

4. Addition and Subtraction (A/S):
 Since the prime factor counting has already been performed, we can proceed with the addition operation.
 The expression becomes 0 + 2 = 2.

5. Concatenation (C):
 Since we have no concatenation between any numbers, the final answer is 2.

The answer is 2."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: According to the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we should first perform the prime factor counting operation, but in this case, there are no prime factors to count in the concatenation operation between 5 and 2 @ 4, as the concatenation operation only deals with the digits of the absolute values of the numbers. So, we can directly move on to the next step, which is addition and subtraction (A & S).

Therefore, our solution would be:

5 + 2 @ 4
 = 5 + 26 (since we need to evaluate the concatenation operation before addition)
 = 31

So, the answer is:

The answer is 31.","GPT Response: To solve the given expression following the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to identify which operation to perform first.

In this expression, ""2 @ 4"" represents the concatenation operation. However, according to the updated order of operations, concatenation (C) comes last after performing all other operations. Therefore, before performing concatenation, we need to evaluate the addition operation ""5 + 2"".

So, the sequence of operations should be:

1. addition (5 + 2 = 7)
2. concatenation (7 @ 4)

Therefore, the final answer is __.

7 @ 4 = 74.","GPT Response: To solve the problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. Parentheses: None in this problem, so we move on to the next operation.
2. Exponents: None in this problem, so we move on to the next operation.
3. Prime Factor Counting (#): We do not have any numbers to find the prime factors of, so we move on to the next operation.
4. Multiplication and Division (MD): There's no multiplication or division in this problem, so we move on to the next operation.
5. Addition and Subtraction (AS): In this problem, we only have addition and concatenation (@). Since the addition comes before the concatenation, we first solve the addition:

5 + 2 = 7

Now, we have 7 and the number 4 to perform concatenation:

7 @ 4

According to our new concatenation rule, we will have:

7 @ 4 = 74

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: Step 1: Identify and solve any operations inside parentheses (if present), in the order given by PEFMDASC. In this case, there are no parentheses.

Step 2: Examine the given expression for any exponents (E) and apply them in the order given by PEFMDASC. There are no exponents in the expression 5 + 2 @ 4.

Step 3: Perform the prime factor counting operation (F) on the expression 5 + 2 @ 4, but since there are no 'a' and 'b' values directly related to this operation in this expression, the answer will be 0. (Basically, prime factor counting can only be applied to pairs of numbers.)

Step 4: Carry out any multiplication and division operations (M/D), following the order given by PEFMDASC. In this case, there is no multiplication or division.

Step 5: Perform any addition and subtraction operations (A/S), adhering to the order given by PEFMDASC.

Addition: To calculate 5 + 2, we proceed according to the A/S part of PEFMDASC order.
First, perform addition within the original parentheses if any: None in this case.
Then, perform addition from left to right: 5 + 2 = 7.

Step 6: Apply the concatenation operation (C) on the expression: In this case, there is no concatenation symbol (@) within the expression 5 + 2.

Since there are no parentheses, exponents, prime factor counting, multiplication, division, or concatenation present in the given expression 5 + 2, the order of operations (PEFMDASC) does not affect the solution.
The answer is: 7."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression with the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to apply the prime factor counting operation (F) since it has a higher precedence than addition and subtraction (AS).

Given expression: 5 + 3 # 2

Since prime factor counting comes before addition according to the new order of operations, we should calculate the prime factor counting of 3 and 2 first:

3 # 2 = 0 (no common prime factors)

Now that we have the result of prime factor counting, we can perform the addition operation:

5 (the result after evaluating prime factor counting operation) + 0

Again, since 0 is an identity element for addition, the final answer will be the numerical value of the first operand, which is 5.

So, the answer is:

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: To solve the given expression 5 + 3 # 2, we need to follow the revised order of operations in mathematics: PEFMDASC.

Since there are no parentheses in the given expression, we move on to the next operation in the order, which is Prime Factor Counting (F). In the expression 3 # 2, the absolute values of 3 and 2 are 3 and 2, respectively. Prime factors of 3 are 3 and for 2 it is 2. Since there is only one shared prime factor 2, the prime factor counting operation results in a count of 1.

Now that we've calculated the prime factor counting, we move on to the next operation - Addition and Subtraction (A/S). Since we are dealing with just addition in the given expression, we evaluate it.

The value of the expression 5 + 3 is calculated as follows:
1. Add the digits of the first numbers: 5 + 3 = 8
2. Carry over and add digits for the remaining numbers if there are any: In this case, there is only one digit each for the numbers, so there's no need for carrying over a digit.

The final answer, thus, is 8 (or 8 as a single digit), the result of the addition and subtraction operation.

So, The answer is 8.","GPT Response: The solution to the given problem is as follows:

First, let's apply the new order of operations (PEFMDASC):
1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses, so we move to the next operation.
2. Exponents: We don't have any exponents, so we move to the next operation.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): Here, we need to check for common prime factors in the numbers given, which are 5 and 3. The common prime factor is 5, so the prime factor count is 1.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D, left to right): We don't have any multiplication or division signs, so we move to the next operation.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S, left to right): We have '+' sign and '#' sign here. Since '#' is a new operation we need to perform first according to the new order, we will do the prime factor counting first. Prime factor counting gives 1, so now we come back to the '+' sign and perform it. In this case, the numbers are small, so we just add the numbers directly: 5 + 3 = 8.
6. Concatenation (C): Since there is no '@' sign present, we don't need to perform this operation.

The answer is: The answer is 8.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 3 # 2 using the revised order of operations PEFMDASC, follow these steps:

Step 1: Identify the operations in the expression.
We have the addition sign (+) and the prime factor counting (#) symbol.

Step 2: Apply the prime factor counting operation (F).
We need to calculate the count of unique prime factors that are shared between the absolute values of the numbers 3 and 2. Prime factors of 3 are 3 and 1, prime factors of 2 are 2. Since there is no shared prime factor, the answer is 0.

Step 3: Apply the addition operation (A).
Now we can proceed with the addition, keeping in mind that we have 0 as the result of the previous operation.
Adding 5 to 0 results in the answer of 5.

2. Prime factor counting (F):
   We need to find the count of unique prime factors shared by all the numbers in this expression.
   Since 18 is the only number present, the prime factor counting operation will give us 0.

   = 108
   Next: Multiply 108 and 2

First, we deal with the parentheses:

6 @ (14 + 4)

Since the addition operation should be done first, we calculate 14 + 4 = 18.

Now, we concatenate 6 and 18:

6 @ 18 = 618

So far, we have:

618

Next, we perform prime factor counting:

6 # 18

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 18 are 2 and 3. We have 2 common prime factors, so:

6 # 18 = 2

Now, we deal with the subtraction operation:

618 - 2

Lastly, we apply concatenation again:

Therefore, The answer is 616.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 using the PEFMDASC order, follow these steps:

Step 1: Parentheses
Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first.
(14 + 4) = 18

Step 2: Exponents
There are no exponents present in the expression, so move on to the next operation.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Calculate the prime factor count for each multiplication problem, working left to right:

a. Prime factor count for 18 and 6:
Since 18's prime factorization is 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 and 6's prime factorization is 2 * 2 * 3, there are 3 shared prime factors. Therefore, 18 # 6 = 3.

b. Prime factor count for 3 and -2:
Since 3's prime factorization is 3, and -2 has prime factorization 2, there is no common prime factor. Thus, 3 # -2 = 0.

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
Perform multiplication and division from left to right:

a. Multiply the result from step 3-a (18 @ 6 = 114) with the result from step 3-c (since there are no shared prime factors, the prime factor count is 0 and multiplication results in 1): 114 * 1 = 114

b. Multiply 114 with the result from step 3-b (since prime factor count is 0, multiplication results in 1): 114 * 1 = 114

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Perform addition and subtraction from left to right:

a. Add 18 (from parentheses) to 114: 114 + 18 = 132

b. Subtract 2 from 132: 132 - 2 = 130

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
Since the addition and subtraction have been completed, the concatenation can now be applied: 6 @ 130 = 6130

2 = 2

6 = 2 * 3 = 2⁴ (Two instances of prime factor 2 and one instance of prime factor 3)

Since 2 is a common prime factor between 8 and 6, the prime factor counting operation results in 1, as we count only the unique prime factors.
