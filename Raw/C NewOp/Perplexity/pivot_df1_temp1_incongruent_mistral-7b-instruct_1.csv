mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem using the newly updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to follow the order of operations as given:

1. Prime Factor Counting: Since there is no multiplication or division sign present, we don't need to perform prime factor counting in this step.
2. Concatenation: Here, we have the number 2 and @ sign with the number 4. So, we need to perform concatenation operation. The concatenation of 2 and 4 is 24.
3. Addition: Now, we have the number 5 and the result of concatenation, which is 24. We need to perform addition operation. So, 5 + 24 = 29.

Therefore, the answer is: The answer is 29."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first focus on the prime factor counting operation (F):

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
   The expression is 8 # 2 + 6 # 6.
   For the first term inside the # symbol: 8 = 2³ * 2. New prime factors encountered are 2 (thrice) and 3.
   For the second term inside the # symbol: 2 = 2 expand to 2 alone since it is a prime number. Prime factors encountered are 2.
   Since both numbers have the same prime factor 2 in common, the prime factor count will be 1. So, 8 # 2 = 1.

2. Plus sign (+):
   Now we consider the addition sign (+) which holds the result of the first term (1) and the second term (the result of 6 # 6).

3. Prime Factor Counting (F):
   For the second term inside the # symbol, we already know that 6 = 2³ * 2 * 3. Prime factors encountered are 2 (thrice) and 3.

4. Prime Factor Counting comparison:
   Comparing the prime factors encountered, we see that both numbers 1 and 6 have a common prime factor, 2, however, the second number also has an additional prime factor, 3. Since there is one common prime factor, but one unique prime factor for each number, the prime factor counting operation result will be 2. So, 6 # 6 = 2.

5. Addition (A):
   Finally, we perform the addition operation: The result will be the sum of both prime factor counting results: 1 + 2 = 3.

The answer is: 3."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: Based on the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F):

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): 4 and 3 share no prime factors, so 4 # 3 equals 0.

Since addition (A) comes before prime factor counting in the new order of operations, we can now perform the addition:

2. Addition (A): Adding the results of 4 # 3 (which is 0) to 2 gives us the final answer.

So, the answer is:

The answer is 2."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: According to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to perform operations inside parentheses, followed by prime factor counting, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), addition and subtraction (from left to right), and finally concatenation.

In this problem, we have:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

First, let's do the operation inside the parentheses:

6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 # 3

Now, perform the prime factor counting operation:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Since there are no common prime factors between 6 and 18 or between 2 and 3, the prime factor counting operation results in 0 for all of them. So we have:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Next, perform addition and subtraction (from left to right):

12 + 6 @ 18

Now, concatenate the digits of the absolute values:

1256 + 18 = 1274

So the final answer is:

The answer is 1274."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we need to follow the newly updated order of operations, which is PEFMDASC. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
First, we need to find the number of unique prime factors shared by the given numbers. In this case, the numbers are 5 and 3, and the number 2 is given outside the parentheses.

 Prime factors of 5: 5
 Prime factors of 3: 3
 Prime factors of 2: 1 (since 2 is already a prime factor of both numbers)

Since there is only one shared prime factor, the prime factor counting operation results in: 5 # 3 # 2 = 1

2. Addition (A):
Now, we need to evaluate the addition operation since it has a higher precedence than concatenation.

5 + 3 = 8

So, the solution after evaluating prime factor counting and addition is: 1 + 8 = 9.

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 9."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematical expression with the new operations and order of operations, we need to follow the given sequence: P, E, F, M/D, A/S, C.

However, in this expression, there are no parentheses, exponents, or negative numbers, so we can start directly with prime factor counting, multiplication, division, addition, and concatenation.

Given expression: 5 + 2 @ 4

Since concatenation comes before addition in the new order of operations, we have to evaluate 2 @ 4 first:

2 @ 4 = 25 (concatenation of 2 and 5 gives 25)

Now, we have the expression: 5 + 25

Since addition comes before concatenation, we have to evaluate 5 + 25:

5 + 25 = 30

So, the final answer is: The answer is 30."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to perform prime factor counting (F) before any other operations.✌ clubs 🃏.

So, let's evaluate the prime factor counting operations in your expression step by step:

1. 8 # 2
   Since the common prime factors of 8 and 2 are 2, the result is 1 (because there is only 1 shared prime factor).

2. 1 # 6
   There are no common prime factors between 1 and 6, so the result is 0.

3. 0 # 6
   Just like the previous calculation, there are no shared prime factors between 0 and 6, and so the result is 0.

4. 8 # 2 + 6 # 6
   We need to apply the distributive property here since there are multiple sums (which you can consider as the repeated application of the addition sign). That is:

   (8 # 2) + (6 # 6)

5. Following the previous steps for prime factor counting, we have:
   - 8 # 2 = 1
   - 1 # 6 = 0
   - 6 # 6 = 1

6. So the final result is the sum of the prime factor counting results of each term:
   The answer is 2."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem 4#3 + 2 according to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to perform prime factor counting (F):

1. 4 has two prime factors: 2 and 2
2. 3 has one prime factor: 3
3. Since 2 is not shared between the factors of 4 and 3; prime factor counting results in 0.

Next, we evaluate addition (A/S), which is the third operation in the new order of operations. Since there is no prime factor counting involved in this problem after evaluating prime factor counting, the addition occurs before concatenation:

4#3 + 2 = (4 # 3) + 2
= 0 (from prime factor counting) + 2
= 2

So, the answer is:

1. Parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18
2. Prime Factor Counting (#): 6 @ 18

6. Addition and Subtraction (AS): Add 6@18 and 12 (which is the same as performing the concatenation first and then adding).

Since 2 is already a prime number, we have:

= 2 # 2 + 2³ # 6

Now, we perform prime factor counting (F) for 2 and 6:

Since 2 is not a prime factor of 1, the conjunction of multiplication and prime factor counting (MD) results in 0:

Since prime factor counting comes before addition, we first count the prime factors in 4 and 3:

- 6 = 2 # 3 # 2 = 3

2. Exponents (E):
Since there are no exponents in the given expression, we move on to the next operation.

3. Multiplication and Division (M/D):
Since there are no multiplication or division operations, we move on to the next operation.

4. Addition and Subtraction (A/S):
We can now evaluate the addition operations. However, since there are no addition signs between the concatenation operations, we must first evaluate the concatenation (C) operations.

5. Concatenation (C):

14 + 4 = 18

Step 2: Concatenate the result from step 1 with the given number 6 as per the operation C (Concatenation).

18 @ 6 = 186

Step 3: Perform addition using the operation A/S (Addition and Subtraction) from left to right.

186 + 12 = 198

Step 4: Conduct prime factor counting, denoted as F, between the absolute values of the numbers being compared in this operation. Since the given numbers are both positive, we can directly calculate the prime factor count.

The prime factor counts for 198 and 3 are 11 and 2, respectively. However, prime factors that are repeated do not increment the prime factor count.

Since there is only one 2 as the common shared prime factor, the result is: 1.
