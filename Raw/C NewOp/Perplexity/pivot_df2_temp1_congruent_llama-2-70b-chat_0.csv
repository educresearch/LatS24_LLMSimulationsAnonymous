2. Addition and subtraction (left to right): 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 0 + 1 = 1

Therefore, the final answer is 1.","GPT Response: The given problem is 8#2 + 6#6.

First, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operations:

8#2 = 8#2 = 0 (since there are no shared prime factors between 8 and 2)
6#6 = 6#6 = 1 (since there is only one shared prime factor, 3)

Next, we need to evaluate the addition (A/S) operation:

Therefore, the final answer is 1.

The answer is 1.","GPT Response: Sure! Let's evaluate the expression 8#2 + 6#6 using the PEFMDASC order of operations.

Step 1: P (Parentheses)
There are no parentheses in this expression, so we can move on to the next step.

Step 2: E (Exponents)
There are no exponents in this expression, so we can move on to the next step.

Step 3: F (Prime Factor Counting)
We need to find the number of unique prime factors shared between 8 and 2, and between 6 and 6.

8 has 2 and 3 as its prime factors.
2 has 2 and 5 as its prime factors.
6 has 2, 3, and 1 as its prime factors.

Therefore, 8#2 = 2 (since there are 2 common prime factors between 8 and 2: 2 and 3).
6#6 = 1 (since there is only 1 common prime factor between 6 and 6: 2).

Step 4: M/D (Multiplication and Division)
There are no multiplication or division operations in this expression, so we can move on to the next step.

Step 5: A/S (Addition and Subtraction)
We need to add 8#2 and 6#6.

8#2 = 2
6#6 = 1

We add 2 and 1, which gives us 3.

Step 6: C (Concatenation)
There are no concatenation operations in this expression, so we can move on to the next step.

Step 7: Final Answer
The answer is 3.

Therefore, 8#2 + 6#6 = 3."
