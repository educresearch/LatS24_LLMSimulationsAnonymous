mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC). According to this order, we should perform prime factor counting (F) before addition (A). 

So, first, let's find the prime factors of 4 and 3. The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3 (since 3 is a prime number). Therefore, the unique shared prime factors of 4 and 3 are 0.

Next, we move to the addition operation. We need to add 2 to the result we got in the previous step, which is 0. So, 0 + 2 equals 2.

Therefore, the answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow the steps below:

1. Prime Factor counting (F)
2. Multiplication and Division (M/D), and Addition and Subtraction (A/S) from left to right
3. Concatenation (C)

Following the order,

4 # 3 + 2
= 2 + 2 (since the prime factors of 4 are 2, and of 3 is also 3, hence shared prime factor is 1, and the prime factor counting of 4 and 3 is 1)
= 4 (since addition comes before concatenation)

So, the answer is 4.","GPT Response: First, we need to follow the order of operations and evaluate the prime factor counting (F) before the addition (+).

4 # 3 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor of 4 and 3 is 1, so the count is 0, but since 1 is not prime, we count the lowest prime factor for 4 which is 2)

Next, we add 2 to the result of 4 # 3.

1 + 2 = 3

Therefore, the answer is 3.","GPT Response: Let's solve this problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations, focusing on the new operations and their placement.

1. Prime Factor counting (F)
   Since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and the prime factors of 3 are 3, there are no shared prime factors (0).

2. Addition (A)
   Now, let's move on to the addition inside the parentheses: 0 + 2.

3. The answer is 2.

So, 4 # 3 + 2 = 0 + 2 = 2."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC). According to this order, we need to perform the prime factorization operation before addition.

So, we first calculate 3#2, which gives us the count of unique prime factors shared by 3 and 2. Since 3 has only one prime factor (3) and 2 is a prime number with only one prime factor (2), there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2. Therefore, 3#2 is equal to 0.

Next, we perform the addition operation and add 5 to 0. Therefore,

5 + 3#2 = 5 + 0 = 5.

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 3#2, we need to follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), which means we should perform Prime Factor counting (F) before Addition (A).

First, let's calculate 3#2: the prime factors of 3 are 3, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since they share no common prime factor, 3#2 = 0.

Now, the original expression 5 + 3#2 becomes 5 + 0.

Next, we perform the Addition (A):

5 + 0 = 5

Therefore,

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: First, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F) between 3 and 2. Since the prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2, there are no common prime factors, so 3 # 2 = 0.

Now we have 5 + 0, which is just 5 (since the addition of 0 to any number doesn't change the number). So,

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we start by performing the addition since it comes before concatenation in the order. So we have:

5 + 2 @ 4
= 5 + 24 (since 2 @ 4 = 24)
= 29

So, the answer is 29.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first evaluate the concatenation operation (C) since it comes before addition (A). The expression 2 @ 4 equals 24.

The expression now becomes:

5 + 24

Now we perform the addition operation (A):

5 + 24 = 29

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC).

First, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we proceed to prime factor counting (F). However, in this case, there are no numbers to compute the prime factor counting for, so we skip this step and move on to multiplication and division (M/D), but there are none in this step as well.

Now, we have addition (A) and concatenation (C) left. We perform the operation that comes first according to the order. In this case, it's addition:

5 + 2 = 7

Since there's no operation left to perform, we stop here.

The answer is 7.","GPT Response: Sure, let's solve this problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses, if any. In this case, there are no parentheses, so we move to the next step.
2. Perform Prime Factor Counting. However, there are no variables with multiplication or division, so we skip this step.
3. Perform Multiplication and Division from left to right. But there are no multiplication or division operations in this expression.
4. Now, perform the Concatenation operation. The concatenation of 2 and 4 is 24, since we drop the leading digits if they are zeros. So, 2 @ 4 = 24.
5. Finally, perform Addition from left to right. We have the number 5 and the result of the concatenation operation. Adding these numbers together, we get 5 + 24 = 29.

The answer is 29."

2. Next, perform concatenation: 6 @ 18 = 618
3. Then, perform the operation #: 618 # 3. To find the prime factors of 618 and 3, we get 2, 3, 103 for 618 and 3 for 3. Since there are no shared prime factors, 618 # 3 = 0.
4. Lastly, we perform the subtraction: 618 - 2 = 616

The answer is 616.","GPT Response: First, we follow the order of operations to solve the expression inside the parentheses:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Now, calculate the concatenation:

108 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right:

120 - 2 # 3

118 # 3

Now, count the prime factors for both numbers:

The prime factors of 118 are 2 and 59 (one shared prime factor, 2).

The prime factors of 3 are 3 (no shared prime factors with 118).

Therefore, 118 # 3 = 0.

Now we have:

The answer is 0.","GPT Response: Let's break down the expression using the revised order of operations PEFMDASC and take care to apply each new operation carefully.

The expression is: 6@(14+4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses
Within the parentheses, we first perform the addition:
14 + 4 = 18

The expression now becomes: 6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: New Operation - Concatenation (C)
Calculate the concatenation operation (C):
6 @ 18 = 618 (digits of |6| and |18| joined together)

The expression now becomes: 618 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction (left to right). Perform these operations from left to right.

First, Do addition: 618 + 12 = 630

Then, Do subtraction: 630 - 2 = 628

The expression now becomes: 628 # 3

Step 4: New Operation - Prime Factor Counting (F)

Calculate the prime factorization counting operation (F):
- 628 has prime factors 2 and 157, and has only 1 shared prime factor 2 with |3|
- 3 has a prime factor of 3 only.

Then, 628 # 3 = 1 (since there is only 1 shared prime factor between 628 and 3)

2 = 2^1

Prime factors of 8 = {2}
Prime factors of 2 = {2}
 shared prime factors = {2}

8 # 2 = 1 (there is only 1 shared prime factor, 2)
