The concatenation operation (C) involves joining the digits of two numbers. In this case, the concatenation is between the number 2 and the digits of the number 4.

First, since we're dealing with the digits of numbers, we need to apply the Concatenation operation before Addition. So, the expression changes to:

5 + 25 (since 2 @ 4 = 25)

Next, since Addition and Subtraction have the same precedence and are performed from left to right, we'll perform the Addition:

5 + 25 = 30.

The answer is 30."

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1.

                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)

Since there is no prime factor counting involved in this expression, we move to Multiplication and Division (M/D). However, there's no multiplication or division present in this expression, so we proceed to Addition and Subtraction (A/S).

We have the signs '+' and '@'. Since addition comes before concatenation, we combine the numbers and the '@' operator in this step:

systemPrompt3_userPrompt2_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 with the new operations and order of operations provided, we need to follow the PEFMDASC rule.

First, we perform prime factor counting:

- For 8: 2^3
- For 2: 2
- For 6: 2^2

Since 2 is the only common prime factor, the prime factor counting operation results in 1. Thus, 8 # 2 = 1 and 6 # 6 = 1.

Next, we perform addition using the result of the prime factor counting:

1 + 1 = 2

Now, according to the updated order, we have to perform concatenation:

Since 1 is a single digit, the result of concatenation is simply 1.

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 1."

1. Parentheses: First, we perform the operation inside the parentheses:

2. Concatenation (C): Since we have an @ symbol after the result from step 1, we need to perform concatenation:
   = 6 @ 18
   = 618

3. Prime Factor Counting (F): There's a # symbol next to the result from the second step, so we need to perform prime factor counting:
   We find the unique prime factors of |618| = 2 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 2 * 3 * 3 and |3| = 3.
   Since there are no shared prime factors, the prime factor counting result is 0.

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There's no multiplication or division symbol in this example, so we move on to the next operation.

In this expression, we have addition (A) and prime factor counting (F) operators. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Since we have prime factor counting (F) before addition (A), we first calculate the prime factor counting of 3 and 2.
2. The prime factors of 3 are 3 itself, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. We have one prime factor in common (2). So, 3 # 2 = 1.
3. Now, we return to the addition (A) operator and perform the addition of the given numbers: 5 + 1 = 6.

The answer is 6."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)

Step 2: Perform the operation inside the parentheses (if present): In this case, there are no parentheses.

Step 3: Handle exponents (E) and prime factor counting (F) if present: There are no exponents or prime factor counting operations in this expression.

Step 4: Perform multiplication and division (M/D) from left to right: No multiplication or division operations are present.

Step 5: Perform addition and subtraction (A/S) from left to right:

Since 2 @ 4 is the next operation, we cannot perform this step yet. We will move on to the next operation after ""5 +"".

Step 6: Perform concatenation (C) from left to right:
1. Perform concatenation: 2 @ 4

Now that we have handled all operations, we can get the final answer:

The answer is: 5 + 25 (since we cannot concatenate the digits from '5' and '2' at this point, we need to perform the addition first).

To get the final result, follow these steps:

systemPrompt4_userPrompt3_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To calculate the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the PEFMDASC order, follow these steps:

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F):
Since there are no parentheses or exponent letters present, we proceed to the next operation, which is prime factor counting (#). However, in this case, we have only the concatenation (C) symbol and the addition (A) symbol, and no multiplication or division symbols. Concatenation does not affect prime factors since it simply joins the digits together, while addition does not change the prime factors of the given numbers. So, in this case, the prime factor counting (F) operation does not contribute to the calculation.

Step 2: Concatenation (C):
Now, we proceed to the next operation in the order, which is concatenation (C). In the given expression, we have 4 and 3 as inputs. Since concatenation is a left-to-right operation, we simply join the digits from the leftmost input to the rightmost input. In this case, we have:

4 # 3 = _

Since concatenation combines the digits of the numbers, the combined digits of 4 and 3 are: 43.

So, 4 # 3 = 43.

Step 3: Addition (A):
Next, we have the addition (A) operation. Add the digits in the concatenated result (43) one by one:

    4
+ 3
----
  7

The sum of 43 is 7.

So, 4 # 3 + 2 = 7.

The answer is 7."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)

                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

1. **Parentheses (P):** Solve the expression inside the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18
2. **Exponents (E):** No exponents are present in this expression.
3. **Prime Factor Counting (F):** Perform prime factor counting, but note that there aren't any negative numbers in this expression. However, we should follow the order, so:
   a. For 6: Prime factors are 2 and 3
   b. For 18: Prime factors are 2 and 2 and 3
4. **Multiplication and Division (M/D):** The only division is implicitly done when performing concatenation with negative numbers, but we will handle that at the concatenation step. For the current multiplication, there are no multiplication signs present in the expression.
5. **Addition and Subtraction (A/S):** Since addition binds more tightly than subtraction, we'll begin with adding the result of the parentheses, 18, to 6: 24
6. **Concatenation (C):** Now we perform concatenation: Since 6 and 24 are not negative, we can simply join the digits together: 624
7. **Subtraction (A/S):** The last operation is '-2': Since we've reached the end of the expressions, and we want to subtract 2 from the final result, we just change 624 to 622.

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Our first step is to calculate the prime factor count of numbers involved in the expression, which is 3 and 2. Since there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, their prime factor count is 0.

2. Addition and Subtraction (AS): Since we are dealing with addition and no subtraction, we move on to the next step.

3. Concatenation (C): However, we need to evaluate concatenation before addition due to the updated order, so for demonstration purposes, let's calculate a potential concatenation that might be present if we had the numbers 5 and 3 swapped. Since 5 and 3 don't have a swap case here and concatenation results in zero (since there are no shared digits), we continue with the expression 3 # 2.

4. Multiplication and Division (MD): Since there are no multiplication or division operations in our expression, we move on to the next step.

5. Exponents (E): None present.

6. Parentheses (P): None present.

Considering the given expression 5 + 3 # 2, following the PEFMDASC order with the prime factorization already done, the steps are as follows:

1. Addition and Subtraction (AS): Add 3 to the result of the prime factor count of 2 which is 0.

2. Concatenation (C): We don't have any numbers to concatenate in this expression, so no action is required at this step.

According to the given expression and the PEFMDASC order, there are no multiplication, division, exponent, or parentheses operations, so no actions are required from those steps either.
