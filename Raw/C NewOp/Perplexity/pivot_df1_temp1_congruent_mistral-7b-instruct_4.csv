1. Parentheses: None in this expression, so we move on to the next step.
2. Exponents: None in this expression, so we move on to the next step.
3. Prime Factor Counting: We do not have enough information to perform prime factor counting since the numbers are not given in absolute form. So, we move on to the next step.
4. Multiplication or Division: None in this expression, so we move on to the next step.
5. Addition or Subtraction: We have an addition sign (+) and two numbers - 5 and 2 - that need to be concatenated, denoted as @ sign. According to the order of operations, we need to perform addition before concatenation. Thus, first, we add 5 and 2, which gives us 7. Next, we concatenate the results 7 and 4, giving us the final answer:

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression according to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to perform the prime factor counting operation between the given digits.

1. Prime factor counting (F):
   For 8#2: 8 has the prime factors 2, 2, and 2, while 2 has the prime factor 2. There is only 1 unique shared prime factor 2, so the result is 1.

   For 6#6: 6 has the prime factors 3 and 2, while 6 has the prime factors 2 and 2. There is 1 unique shared prime factor 2, so the result is 1.

Now, since addition (A) comes before prime factor counting (F) in the expanded order of operations, we need to evaluate the addition part of the expression.

2. Addition (A):
   1 + 1 = 2

The answer is 2."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: Since the new order of operations is PEFMDASC, the first step is to perform the prime factor counting operation between the given numbers 4 and 3. The prime factorization of 4 is 2^2 and 2 is the only shared prime factor with 3 which has prime factorization 2 and 3. So, the prime factor counting operation results in a count of 1.

Then, perform the addition operation indicated in the expression: 3 + 2 = 5.

Finally, perform the prime factor counting operation between the results of the above two operations which are 1 (prime factorization of 4) and 5 (prime factorization of 3 + 2). Since there are no shared prime factors, the prime factor counting operation results in 0.

Following the new order of operations, the final answer is:

1. Calculate 14 + 4 = 18.

Now, we apply the concatenation operation to the result and the number 6:

2. 6 @ 18 = 618

Next, we perform the prime factor counting operation:

3. 6 # 18 = 1

Finally, we perform the subtraction and addition operations from left to right:

4. 618 + 12 - 2 = 626

So the answer is:

The answer is 626."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem using the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation. So, we calculate the unique prime factors shared by 3 and 2, but since there's only 1 prime factor (1 and 2 are both prime) and it appears only in the multiplicative factor 2, the count is 1.

Now, we move to the addition operation. Since there are no parentheses or exponents involved, we directly perform the addition.

So, the calculation would be as follows:

1. Evaluate the prime factor counting operation (3#2) = 1 (since there's only 1 shared prime factor, 2)
2. Perform the addition operation: 5 + 1 = 6

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 5 + 2 @ 4 using the newly introduced mathematical operations and updated order of operations, we need to follow the order: Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting (F), Multiplication and Division (M/D), Addition and Subtraction (A/S), Concatenation (C).

Since there are no parentheses, we move on to the next operation: Exponents. There are no exponents in this problem.

Next, we apply Prime Factor counting (F):
The prime factors of 5 are 5,
The prime factors of 2 are 2,
The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.

Since there is only one shared prime factor '2' between 5 and 2 and between 5 and 4, the prime factor counting value is 1.

Moving on to Multiplication and Division (M/D), but there are no multiplication or division operations in this problem.

Next, is Addition and Subtraction (A/S):
5 + 2 = 7

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve the given Mathematics problem with the new mathematical operations and updated order of operations, we need to follow the order of operations PEFMDASC. Since there are no parentheses, exponents, or prime numbers involved, we can directly apply the given operations.

So, according to the order of operations, the first operation to perform is Prime Factor Counting (F). In this problem, we are given a and b as 8 and 6, respectively. Applying the prime factorization operation for both numbers, we get:

- Prime factors of 8: 2, 2, 2, 2
- Prime factors of 6: 2, 3

Since there are no common prime factors between the prime factors of 8 and 6, the outcome of the prime factor counting operation will be 0.

Therefore, the evaluation of the given Mathematics problem according to the updated order of operations is 0 (zero) as the final answer:

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we need to follow the newly updated order of operations, which is PEFMDASC. In this case, we only have concatenation (C) and addition (A) operations. Hence, the order simplifies to C and A.

According to the problem, we first perform the concatenation operation and then perform the addition operation. This follows the C and A positions in the updated order of operations.

Given expression: 4 # 3 + 2

First, we perform the prime factor counting operation (#) between 4 and 3:

1 (There is only one prime factor 2 in the factorization of 4 and 2 in the factorization of 3)

Since # is not included in the final calculation, we move ahead and apply the concatenation operation:

Step 1: Concatenate 4 and 3: 4_3

Now, the last operation remaining is the addition operation (+).

Step 2: Add the digits in the result of concatenation:

4 + 3 = 7

So, the solution to the problem 4 # 3 + 2 is to concatenate 4 and 3, obtaining 4_3, and then add the resulting digits: 7.

The answer is 7."

Finally, we perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right:

6. 618 + 12 - 2
7. = 628 - 2

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem with the new mathematical operations and updated order of operations, we need to follow the PEFMDASC rule. In this problem, we are given the expression 5 + 3 # 2.

First, we need to evaluate prime factor counting (F) since it comes before all other operations. However, in this case, the prime factor counting operation only includes the digits 2, 3, and itself.  So the prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since there is no common prime factor between 2 and 3, we get 0 for the outcome of this operation.

Now, we can focus on the addition (A). Since addition comes before concatenation (C) in the updated order of operations, we need to evaluate the addition first. So the problem becomes:

5 + 0

Since 0 is the additive identity, we get 5 as the final result.

Therefore, the answer to the problem 5 + 3#2, taking into account the new mathematical operations and updated order of operations, is 5."

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): In this problem, we have the addition sign (""+"") and the ""@"" symbol for concatenation. Concatenation is considered a right-associative binary operation. However, based on the updated order of operations, we need to perform addition before concatenation. Hence, we will perform the addition first and then concatenate the results.

1. Parentheses: We have one pair of parentheses, which contains the expression 14 + 4. We need to evaluate this expression first:
   14 + 4 = 18

2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this expression, so we move on to the next operation.

3. Prime Factor Counting: We have the concatenation symbol @ and the prime factor counting symbol #. However, we need to evaluate concatenation before prime factor counting, as per the updated order of operations. So, let's evaluate the concatenation first:

6 @ 18 = 618

4. Multiplication and Division (left to right): We have multiplication and division but no addition or subtraction yet. Multiplication takes precedence over division, so let's evaluate the multiplication operation if there is any:

There is no multiplication operation between the symbols, so we move on to the next operation.

5. Addition and Subtraction (left to right): Now we have addition and subtraction. We need to evaluate them from left to right. We have subtraction before addition:

12 - 2 = 10

6. Concatenation: Now we have the concatenation symbol # between two numbers. However, we need to evaluate concatenation before prime factor counting, as per the updated order of operations. So, let's evaluate the concatenation first:

6 # 3 = 0 (there are no shared prime factors between 6 and 3)

7. Prime Factor Counting: We have prime factor counting between the two numbers, so let's evaluate it:

- For 6: prime factors are 2 and 3.
- For 3: prime factors are 3.

6#6 = 3 (The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, while the prime factors of 6 are 2, 2, and 3. Three unique prime factors are shared between the two numbers.)

Step 2: Since there are parentheses, evaluate the expressions inside them first. In this case, there are none.

Step 3: Perform exponentiation (E) if there are any exponents. In this expression, there are none.

Step 4: Perform prime factor counting (F) for the given expression.

Since there are no parentheses, exponents, or prime factor counting inside the main expression yet, this step does not apply.

Step 5: Perform division and multiplication (M/D) from left to right.

There are no division or multiplication operations given in the expression, so we skip this step.

Since 3 and 2 have only one prime factor in common, the result of the prime factor counting operation is zero: 5 + 3#2 = 0 + (joining 5 and the result of prime factor counting of 3 and 2)

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting of 3 and 2 (F)
The expression inside the parenthesis, 3#2, represents the prime factor count of 3 and 2:
- Prime factors of 3: 3
- Prime factors of 2: 2

Since 3 and 2 have only one prime factor in common, the result of the prime factor counting operation is zero: 0 + (joining 5 and 0)

Step 3: Concatenation (C)
Since the result of the previous step was to join 5 and 0, the answer would be 5.
