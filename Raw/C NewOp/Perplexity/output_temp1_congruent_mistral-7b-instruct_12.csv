Given expression: 4 # 3 + 2

First, we perform prime factor counting (F) for the numbers 4, 3, and 2:

- The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
- The prime factors of 3 are 3.
- The prime factors of 2 are 2.

Since 2 is the only shared prime factor, we have 4 # 3 = 1 (as stated in example (b) in the text).

So now we have 1 + 2. According to the new order of operations, addition should be evaluated after concatenation (C), so let's put the parentheses to group the addition operation:

systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression using the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to deal with the operation inside the parentheses.

1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:
   14 + 4 = 18

2. Concatenate the result with the digit 6:
   6 @ 18 = 618

3. Perform prime factor counting:
   The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 18 are 2, 2, and 3. Since 2 and 3 are unique shared prime factors between 6 and 18, the prime factor counting operation results in a count of 2.

4. Perform addition:
    618 + 12 = 630

5. Concatenate the result with the digit 2:
    630 @ 2 = 6302

6. Perform prime factor counting:
    The prime factors of 630 are 2, 3, 3, 2, 5, 2, 7, and 5. Since 2 and 5 are unique shared prime factors between 630 and 2, the prime factor counting operation results in a count of 2.

7. Subtract:
    6302 - 2 = 6300

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 6300."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e.,

                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

1. Parentheses: None in this expression, so we move on to the next operation.
2. Exponents: None in this expression, so we move on to the next operation.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): In this expression, we need to perform prime factor counting on 4 and 3. The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since there is only one shared prime factor 2, the result of 4 # 3 is 1.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): None in this expression, so we move on to the next operation.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): In this expression, we need to perform addition 2 and the result of concatenation 4 # 3. As per the new order, we need to evaluate addition before concatenation. However, since the prime factor counting operation is already performed, we don't need to repeat it for the result of addition and concatenation, as our order only mentions performing prime factor counting before multiplication and division. Therefore, the answer will be the sum of 1 and 2, which is 3.
6. Concatenation (C): In this step, we perform concatenation of the result we obtained in step 5 (3) and the result obtained by performing concatenation of 4 and 3 in step 3 (13). As per the new order, concatenation is the last operation, so we simply concatenate both the results, giving us 313.

systemPrompt2_userPrompt4_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: According to the newly updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to deal with the parentheses:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2

We evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first:

6 @ (18) + 12 - 2

Now, we apply the addition:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2

Since we need to do concatenation before subtraction, we first perform the concatenation:

6 @ 138 + 12 - 2

Next, we apply the prime factor counting between the two numbers being concatenated:

6 @ 138 + 12 - 2 # 138 # 6

The prime factors of 6 are {2, 3}, and the prime factors of 138 are {2, 2, 2, 3, 19}. Since the only shared prime factor is 2, the result of the prime factor counting is 2.

So we have:

2 @ 138 + 12 - 2

Now we apply the addition from left to right:

2 @ 140 + 12

Since concatenation is the last operation, we perform it now:

2138 @ 12

The prime factor counting between the two numbers being concatenated gives us:

2138 # 12

The prime factors of 2138 are {2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 19, 31}, and the prime factors of 12 are {2, 2, 3}. Since the only shared prime factor is 2, we have the prime factor counting as 2.

Therefore, the final answer is:

systemPrompt3_userPrompt2_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem with the new mathematical operations and order of operations, follow these steps:

1. Identify the prime factor counting (#) operations and perform them first, since they have precedence over other operations according to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC).

2. In this problem, there are two prime factor counting operations: 8#2 and 6#6. Let's calculate the results of these operations:

   - For 8#2: The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since there are two shared prime factors (2), the result of 8#2 is 2.
   - For 6#6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3, the result of 6#6 is 0.

   Now, we have the results of prime factor counting operations: 2 and 0.

3. Perform the addition operation using these results since the addition operation has higher precedence than concatenation (which is the next operation) in the order of operations.

4. The addition operation here is 2 + 0, which equals 2.

5. Finally, since we have already performed the prime factor counting and addition operations, there is only the concatenation operation left to perform. Since the concatenation operation has the lowest precedence in the updated order of operations, we perform it last.

6. Concatenating the digits of 2 and 6, we get the final answer: 26.

So, the updated answer to this problem, considering the new mathematical operations and order of operations, is:

The answer is 26."

Therefore, we first find the prime factors of 2: 2.

Now, since there is only one number (2) with the prime factor counting symbol, we only need to evaluate that part. Since 2 is a prime number itself, the prime factor count is 1.

So now that we have evaluated the prime factorization, the expression is reduced to:

5 + 1

Adding the numbers 5 and 1, we have the final answer:

The answer is 6."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt3_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To perform the given expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the PEFMDASC order, follow these steps:

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
First, calculate the prime factor counts of 3 and 4:
- Prime factors of 3: 2, 3
- Prime factors of 4: 2, 2

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, determine the shared prime factors and count their occurrences:
- The shared prime factors between 3 and 4 are 2. 
- Since 2 appears only once in the prime factorization of 3 and once in the prime factorization of 4, the prime factor count is 1 (1 + 1 = 2).

So, 4 # 3 = 1.

Step 3: Addition (A)
Now, perform the addition: 1 + 2 = 3

Therefore, the answer is 3."
