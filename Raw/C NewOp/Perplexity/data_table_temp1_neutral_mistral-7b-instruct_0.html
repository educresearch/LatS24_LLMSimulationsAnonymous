To find the unique prime factors shared by 4 and 3, we have prime factors of 4: 2, 2, 2, and prime factors of 3: 3. Since there is no common prime factor (all prime factors of 4 are 2 and all prime factors of 3 are 3), the prime factor counting (#) operation results in 0.<br><br>Next, based on the updated order of operations:<br><br>1. Since prime factor counting (F) must be performed before addition and subtraction (A and S), we have 0 + 2:<br><br>The answer is 2.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we need to follow the newly revised order of operations, namely PEFMDASC. Since there are no parentheses or exponents in this expression, we will begin with prime factor counting (F).<br><br>Given expression: 4 # 3 + 2<br><br>First, let's evaluate the prime factor counting (F):<br>1. Identify the prime factors of each number: The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3.<br>2. Count the number of unique shared prime factors. In this case, none of the numbers share any prime factors, as prime factors of 4 are 2 while those of 3 are 3. So, the result of # operation will be 0.<br><br>Now that we have the result of the prime factor counting (F) operation, we can move on to other operations in the given order:<br><br>1. Addition and Subtraction (S): Since there is only an addition operation, we can perform it directly.<br>2. Concatenation (C): Lastly, we will perform the concatenation operation since it is last in the order of operations.<br><br>So, following the given order of operations (PEFMDASC), the calculation will be:<br><br>0 (prime factor counting) → 2 (addition) → 23 (concatenation)<br><br>The answer is 23.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to identify which operations need to be performed first.<br><br>Since we have prime factor counting (F) and concatenation (C) in our sequence, we need to evaluate prime factor counting before concatenation. However, in this case, we don't have any negative numbers or multiple digits, so prime factor counting results in a count of 0 for both numbers 3 and 4.<br><br>Therefore, in this particular problem, both operations (concatenation and addition) are just simple arithmetic operations. So the order of performing them doesn't matter, and we can do addition before or after concatenation as follows:<br><br>1) 4 # 3 = 0 (applying prime factor counting)<br>2) Additionally, in this case, there's no need for parentheses, exponents, or multiplication/division.<br>3) Following the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we finally perform concatenation: 0 @ 3 = 03<br><br>4) Lastly, we follow the second-to-the-last operation in the sequence, addition: 03 + 2 = 2<br><br>The answer is 2.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the PEFMDASC order, we need to follow these steps:<br><br>1. Prime factor counting (F):<br>   4 = 2², so prime factors of 4 are 2.<br>   3 is a prime number itself, so prime factors of 3 are 3.<br>   Since there is only one shared prime factor (2), the result of the prime factor counting operation is 1.<br><br>2. Addition and Subtraction (A/S):<br>   Since there is no subtraction in this expression, we can skip this step.<br><br>3. Concatenation (C):<br>   Since there are no numbers to be concatenated before the addition operation, we can skip this step as well.<br><br>4. Multiplication and Division (M/D):<br>   In this expression, there is no multiplication or division to be performed.<br><br>5. Exponents (E):<br>   There are no exponents in the expression, so this step can be skipped.<br><br>6. Parentheses (P):<br>   There are no parentheses present, so this step is not necessary.<br><br>Given that all the steps from PEFMDASC have been followed, we can now evaluate the expression:<br><br>The answer is 1 (from the prime factor counting step).</td>

Prime Factor Counting (F): We don't have two numbers to compare for prime factor counting, so we move on to the next step.<br>4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There is no multiplication or division symbol, but we do have a concatenation symbol (@) which has a higher precedence than addition and subtraction. However, since we don't yet have both numbers for the concatenation, we cannot perform it at this step. So, we move on to the next step.<br>5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): In this step, we will evaluate the addition operation: 5 + 4<br>6. Concatenation (C): Since we couldn't perform the concatenation at step 4, we will try it now.
