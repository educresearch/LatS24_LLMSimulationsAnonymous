2 + 2 = 4

Therefore, the answer is 4.","GPT Response: Following the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F) within the problem. The number 4 has prime factors of 2, and the number 3 has a prime factor of 3. Since there are no shared prime factors between the two numbers, the prime factor counting operation will result in 0.

So, the equation becomes:

0 + 2

Next, we perform the addition (A), since it is the first operation in the new order of operations that we have not yet executed.

0 + 2 = 2

Therefore, the answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve the problem, we follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC).

3. Prime Factor Counting (F): The only operation left to consider in the expression is 2 @ 4.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There are no multiplication or division operations in this expression.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We now perform the addition operation, 5 + (prime factor counting result).
6. Concatenation (C): We concatenate the result of the prime factor counting operation with 4.

First, we calculate 2 @ 4 = 26.
Then, we add 5 + 26 = 31.

The answer is 31.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to follow it step by step:

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in this problem, so we skip this step.

First, calculate the prime factor counting (F) operation:

3 # 2 = 0 (since 3 has no shared prime factor with 2)

Next, proceed with the addition (A) operation:

5 + 0 = 5

Therefore, the solution to the expression 5 + 3 # 2 is:

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations, we first perform the prime factor counting operation (F) between 3 and 2. Since the only prime factor of 2 is 2 and it is not shared with 3, the result of 3 # 2 is 0.

Now, our problem becomes 5 + 0. Since addition is the only operation left, we can now calculate the result.

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: First, according to the new order of operations, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) before addition (A). The prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, the operation 3 # 2 equals 0.

1. Parentheses: 14 + 4 equals 18.
2. Prime Factor counting (F): 6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 # 3. Since 6 and 18 have no shared prime factors, the F operation between 6 and 18 equals 0.
3. Addition and Subtraction (A and S): Still, 6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 # 3. We now perform the concatenation (C) operation before the subtraction, following the order established: 618 @ 12 - 2 # 3.

   - 2 has a single prime factor of 2
   - 6 has prime factors of 2 and 3
   - 6 also has prime factors of 2 and 3
2. Now, we determine the shared prime factors (counted once) between 8 and 2:
   - There are no shared prime factors, so 8 # 2 = 0
3. Next, we do the same for 6 and 6:
   - The shared prime factors are 2 and 3, so 6 # 6 = 2
4. Finally, we add the results according to the order of operations:
   - The answer is 0 + 2 or simply 2.

Therefore, The answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we must follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), which includes Prime Factor counting (F) before Addition/Subtraction (A/S).

First, let's calculate 8 # 2:
The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 2 are just 2. The only shared prime factor is 2, so 8 # 2 = 1.

Next, calculate 6 # 6:
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 6 are the same - 2 and 3. We have 2 shared prime factors, so 6 # 6 = 2.

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: For the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6, we need to follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC. In this case, there are no Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, or Subtraction, so we just need to evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation first and then proceed with Concatenation (C).

8 # 2 = 2 (since the prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and of 2 is just 2, so there is 1 shared prime factor 2)

6 # 6 = 1 (since the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and of 6 is 2 and 3, so there are no shared prime factors)

Now, we can proceed with the Concatenation (C) operation.
