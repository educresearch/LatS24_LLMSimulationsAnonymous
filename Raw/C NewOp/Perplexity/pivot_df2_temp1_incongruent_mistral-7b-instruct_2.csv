mistral-7b-instruct,1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: According to the expanded order of operations PEFMDASC, the first step is to perform the prime factor counting operation. In this case, we have 4 and 3 as operands. The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since there is no shared prime factor, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 0.

So, the expression 4 # 3 + 2 simplifies to 0 + 2, which gives us the answer:

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: According to the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to perform prime factor counting before addition. However, in this case, both numbers 4 and 3 have the same prime factors, i.e., 2. Therefore, their prime factor counting operation results in a shared prime factor count of 1.

Now, we can perform the addition:

1 (result of prime factor counting) + 2

So, the answer is:

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: To solve the given problem with the new mathematical operations and order of operations, we should follow the updated order of PEFMDASC:

1. Prime Factor Counting (#): Let's find the prime factor count of 4 and 3: 
   The prime factors of 4: 2, 2, 2
   The prime factors of 3: 3
   Since we have no common prime factors, 4 # 3 = 0 (as per key example (d) in the concatenation and prime factor count section).

2. Addition (A): Now, let's add 2 to the result of the prime factor count (as the addition comes before concatenation per the updated order):
   The answer is 2.

So, to summarize: 
Given: 4 # 3 + 2

Our steps (following the new order of operations): Prime Factor Counting, Addition

Solution: 
1. Prime Factor Counting (4 # 3) = 0
2. Addition (0 + 2)

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Step 1: Prime factor counting (F)
Let's first find the prime factor counting for a and b. In this case, a = 4 and b = 3.

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
The prime factors of 3 are 3.

Since there is only 1 prime factor, 2, that is common to both 4 and 3, the prime factor counting is 1.

Step 2: Addition and Subtraction (S)
Since this problem involves addition, we'll move on to the addition phase. However, we still need to add the result of the prime factor counting (which is a constant value of 1 in this case) to the second number 2.

4 # 3 + 2 = 1 + 2

Step 3: Concatenation (C)
Finally, we perform the concatenation.

1 + 2 = 3
So, the answer is 3.

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 31.","GPT Response: To solve the given problem with the newly introduced mathematical operations and updated order of operations, we need to follow the given sequence: PEFMDASC. Since there are no parentheses or exponents present in the given expression, we can begin with prime factor counting (F), multiplication and division (M/D), addition, and subtraction (A/S), and concatenation (C) in that order.

Given expression: 5 + 2 @ 4

First, we evaluate the concatenation (C):

5 + 2 @ 4
= 5 + 26 (since we need to evaluate concatenation before addition)

The answer is 31.","GPT Response: To solve the given expression with the new mathematical operations and order of operations, we need to follow the PEFMDASC rule.

1. Parentheses: None in this expression.
2. Exponents: None in this expression.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We don't have any numbers given for prime factor counting, so we will skip this step.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): We have @ which is actually concatenation, but the symbol @ looks similar to multiplication. However, according to the given order of operations, we need to evaluate concatenation before multiplication and division. So in this case, there isn't any multiplication or division in the expression.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We have 5 + 2@4
6. Concatenation (C): We have 2@4, so we need to evaluate the concatenation first, which results in 24. Now we have 5 + 24.

According to the updated order of operations, we need to evaluate addition and subtraction before concatenation. So we have:

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 2@4 using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), follow these steps:

1. Identify and solve any operations inside parentheses: There are no parentheses in the given expression. So, we move on to the next step.

2. Exponents: There are no exponents present in the expression. Proceed to the next step.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F): There are no numbers with more than one digit, so we don't need to calculate prime factor counting. Proceed to the next step.

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): In this expression, there is only one multiplication operation, which is represented as concatenation (2@4). Since concatenation is a new operation, we treat it as a single entity for now. In the final step, we will separate the digits and apply concatenation as the last step. Thus, this operation takes place before addition and subtraction.

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): In our expression, there is one addition operation (5 + 2@4). Since multiplication and division take place before addition and subtraction based on the updated order of operations, we will solve the multiplication operation (2@4) first.

6. Multiplication and Division (M/D): Since we've already identified the multiplication operation (2@4), we go ahead and solve it first, revealing the digits to be multiplied: 2 and 4.

Multiplication: 2 @ 4 = 24

So, the expression becomes: 5 + 24

7. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Now, it's time to solve the addition operation:

Addition: 5 + 24 = 29

mistral-7b-instruct,1,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: Based on the newly defined order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first perform the prime factor counting operation. In this case, we have 3 numbers to consider: 5, 3, and 2.

Since prime factorization of 5 is 5, prime factorization of 3 is 3, and prime factorization of 2 is 2, the number of unique prime factors shared amongst 5, 3, and 2 is 1.

So, the result of the prime factor counting operation (#) is 1, and we move to the next operation in the order of operations, which is addition (+). However, since there are no parentheses, exponents or concatenation present before the addition symbol (+), we immediately evaluate the sum of the two numbers involved in the addition operation.

Thus, the final answer is:

The answer is 1 + 3 = 4.","GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we need to follow the newly updated order of operations, which is PEFMDASC. In this problem, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we start with prime factor counting (F).

We have 3 and 2, and their absolute values are 3 and 2. The prime factorization of 3 is 3, and the prime factorization of 2 is 2. Since both numbers have the prime factor 2, this indicates that the prime factor counting operation (#) will yield a result other than 0. Therefore, we have:

3 # 2 = 1

Since there are no more operations left, the final answer is:

The answer is 1.","GPT Response: Based on the new updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to follow the steps as given below:

First, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation (#), which in this case is 2. So, we need to find the common prime factors of |5| and |3|, which are both 5. Since the result is not 0, we have a prime factor overlap, which means the result of the prime factor counting operation is 1.

Now, we move on to the addition operation (A), which comes after prime factor counting in the new order of operations. So, we add 5 and 3: 5 + 3 = 8.

Therefore, the calculation according to the new mathematical operations and updated order of operations is as follows:

5 + 3 # 2 = 8 (since 5 + 3 = 8 and 5 # 3 = 1)

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 8.","GPT Response: Step 1: Identify and handle any parentheses, if present. in this case, there are none. So we move to the next operation in the order.

Step 2: Calculate exponents, if present. Since there are no exponents in the expression, we move on to the next operation.

Step 3: Perform prime factor counting, denoted by #. In this expression, we have two numbers, 5 and 3, which we compare in terms of prime factors. The prime factors of 5 are 5 and the prime factors of 3 are 2 and 3. Since 5 and 3 share no common prime factors, their prime factor counting is 0.

Step 4: Proceed with multiplication and division (M/D), from left to right. In this expression, there is only one multiplication sign, so we'll calculate it between the given numbers, which are 5 and 2 in result is 10. Since there is no division in this expression, we move onto the next operation.

Step 5: Carry out addition and subtraction (A/S) from left to right. Since there is only one addition sign in the expression, we calculate the sum of the numbers on its left, which are 3 and 0 (from the result of prime factor counting) resulting in 3. To the right of the addition sign is the number 2. So we add 3 and 2 to get the final answer, resulting in the expression becoming 3+2=5.

The answer is 5."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first focus on the operation inside the parentheses:

1. Calculate the addition inside the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18

Next, perform concatenation:

2. Concatenation: 6 @ 18 = 618

Now, calculate prime factor counting:

3. Prime factor counting: 2#3 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3.

Next, perform the subtraction:

4. Subtraction: 618 - 2 = 616

However, since prime factor counting comes before subtraction, we need to recalculate the prime factor counting with the corrected numbers:

5. Prime factor counting: 2#3 = 0
6. Prime factor counting: 2#616 = 1 (prime factors of 616 are 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 7. Since 2 is shared once between 2 and 616, there's one shared prime factor.)

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 615 (the correct subtraction result of 618 and 2 is 616 but since 2#3=0, prime factor counting must be done as if 2 were present, resulting in 615 instead of 614).","GPT Response: To solve the problem with the new mathematical operations and updated order of operations, follow these steps:

1. Parentheses: Evaluate what's inside the parentheses first.
   = (14 + 4)
   = 18

2. Prime Factor Counting (#): Calculate the prime factor count of the numbers involved in the operation #. We only have one pair of numbers, so we'll calculate the prime factor count between 18 and 3. Since there are no shared prime factors (the prime factors of 18 are 2, 2, 3, 3, and 3, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3), the prime factor count is 0.

3. Concatenation (@): Since there's no addition or subtraction mentioned yet, we can perform the concatenation (@) operation first. We need to concatenate 6 and 18.

   = 6 @ 18
   = 618

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): In this problem, we don't have multiplication or division operations, so we'll move to the next operation.

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We have an addition (+) operation between 618 and 12, and a subtraction (-) operation between 618 and 2. Evaluate the subtraction first because its operands have lower precedence than the addition.

   = 618 - 2

3. Prime Factor Counting: 6 # 18 = 2 (since prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, prime factors of 18 are 2, 3, and 3, and both numbers share only 2 as a prime factor, resulting in a prime factor count of 2)
4. Multiplication and Division (left to right): 2 * 12 = 24

Step 2: Exponents (None in this expression)

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Let's find the unique prime factors for each absolute value:

- |6| = 2 * 3
- |18| = 2 * 2 * 3 * 3
- |12| = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 3
- |2| = 2
- |3| = 3

Now let's compute the prime factor count for each pair:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3
= 2 * 3 @ 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 + 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 - (2 * 2 * 3 * 3) # 3
= 6 # (2 * 2 * 3 * 3) + (2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 3) # 3 - 9
= (1 + 1) # 3 + (4) # 3 - 9
= (2) # 3 + 4 - 9 (Since 1 # 3 = 0)

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
Since there's only one multiplication in this expression, we cannot proceed without calculating Prime Factor Counting first. Therefore, we'll wait for the result from Step 3.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Once we get the result of Prime Factor Counting, we'll be able to perform Addition and Subtraction.

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
We'll perform Concatenation last with the given result from Step 3.

So, after completing all the steps according to the PEFMDASC order, we'll have the final answer.

Let's wait for the output of Step 3 (Prime Factor Counting) to get the final answer.
