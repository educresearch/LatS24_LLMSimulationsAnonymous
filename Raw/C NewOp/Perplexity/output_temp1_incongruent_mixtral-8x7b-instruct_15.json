Consider the expression: 5 + 3 # 2\n2. There are no parentheses or exponents, so we proceed to Prime Factor Counting (F). We calculate the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 3 and 2. However, since 2 is a prime number, the prime factor of 2 is just 2 itself. Thus, there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2. So, 3 # 2 = 0.\n3. Now the expression becomes: 5 + 0\n4. Finally, we perform Addition (A): 5 + 0 = 5\n\nThe answer is 5."}]}]
