1. Parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18
2. Exponents: We don't have any exponents in this problem, so we can skip this step.
3. Prime Factor counting: 6 # 18 = 2 (since the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 18 are 2 and 3^2, they share a prime factor 2)
4. Multiplication and Division: We don't have any multiplication or division in this problem, so we can skip this step.
5. Addition and Subtraction: 12 - 2 = 10, so the equation becomes 6@18 + 10 # 3

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

                    = 20 @ 42 = 2042. (concatenation is last)

First, let's calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) for both 8#2 and 6#6.

8#2: Prime factors of 8 are 2*2*2, and prime factors of 2 are 2. Since they share one prime factor, the result is 1.

6#6: Prime factors of 6 are 2*3, and prime factors of 6 are 2*3. Since they share two prime factors, the result is 2.

Now replace 8#2 and 6#6 with their results:

1 + 2

Finally, perform the Addition (A):

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:

                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)

Let's solve the expression step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations, where I'll highlight each step clearly and emphasize the new operations.

The expression is: 5 + 2 @ 4

Step 1: Identify and perform any operations inside parentheses (none in this case).

Step 2: Calculate the prime factor counting (F) of the numbers involved, if applicable. In this case, there are no operations involving prime factor counting, so we can move on to the next step.

Step 3: Perform any exponents (E), if applicable. Again, there are no exponents in this expression.

Step 4: Do any multiplication (M) or division (D) from left to right, if applicable. Neither of these operations appear in this expression.

Step 5: Perform the concatenation (C) operation from left to right. Here, we need to concatenate 2 and 4, since they are next to each other in the expression:

5 + 24

Step 6: Finally, perform any remaining addition (A) or subtraction (S) from left to right. In this case, we simply add 5 to 24:

5 + 24 = 29

The answer is 29."

First, perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation as it comes before addition in the order.

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
The prime factors of 3 are 3.

Since the only common prime factor is 1, the calculation of the Prime Factor Counting (F) is:

F = 1

Now, calculate the addition operation:

1 + 2 = 3

So, the expression becomes: 3

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

1. First, we need to evaluate what's inside the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18.
2. Next, calculate the Concatenation (C) operation: 6 @ 18 = 618.
3. Continue with the new operation Prime Factor Counting (F): 3 # 12 = 0 (since 3 has prime factors of 3 and 12 has prime factors of 2, 2, and 3, and they share no common prime factors).
4. Then perform the remaining operations from left to right: 618 + 12 - 2 = 630 - 2 = 628.

The answer is 628."
