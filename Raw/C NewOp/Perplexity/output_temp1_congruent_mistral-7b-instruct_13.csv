systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the expanded order of operations (PEFMDASC), first, we will deal with the operation inside the parentheses:

1. Calculate the expression inside the parentheses, following the standard order of operations (PEMDAS):
   = 14 + 4
   = 18

Next, we will perform concatenation:

2. Concatenate 6 and the result from the previous step:
   = 6 @ 18
   = 618

Now, we will perform prime factor counting:

3. Find prime factors common to the absolute values of the operands in the last operation, i.e., 6 and 18. Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3; prime factors of 18 are 2 and 3. Since we have 2 common, the prime factor counting operation results in 2.

Finally, we will perform addition and subtraction:

4. Add the result from the concatenation and the result from prime factor counting:
   = 618 + 2
   = 620

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 620."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

Since there are no parentheses, we evaluate sets of operations in the following order:
- Prime Factor Counting (F)
- Exponents (E)
- Multiplication and Division (M/D)
- Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
- Concatenation (C)

In the given expression 4 # 3 + 2, there are no exponent or prime factor counting operations, and there is no need for parentheses.

Thus, we start evaluating addition and subtraction (A/S), which comes third in the new order of operations. So we evaluate 3+2 = 5. Now we have 4 # 5.

Next is concatenation (C), which comes last in the new order of operations. So, we perform the concatenation operation on the given digits, i.e., 4 and 5.

Hence, the answer is 45.

systemPrompt3_userPrompt2_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated mathematical operations and the given order of operations PEFMDASC, we first perform the prime factor counting (F) for both numbers 8 and 6.

The prime factorization of 8: 2³ x 2⁴
The prime factorization of 6: 2² x 3²

Since there's no common prime factor in their prime factorizations (shared prime factors are 2³, 2⁴, and 3²), prime factor counting results in 0. We continue to the next operation, which is addition (A/S).

So, 8#2 + 6#6 = 0 + 6#6

Now we perform concatenation (C) on the last term 6#6.
Since 6 is a positive number:
1#6 = 0 because there's no common prime factor (no shared prime factors between 1 and 6).
So 6#6 = 6#(6#1) = 6#0 = 6

Therefore, the answer is 0 + 6 = 6."

Given expression: 5 + 3#2

Since prime factor counting (#) has a higher precedence than addition (+), we need to calculate the prime factor counting first:

3#2 = 0 (since the prime factors of 3 are 3 and those of 2 are 2, and there are no shared prime factors between them)

Now that we have the result of the prime factor counting operation, we can perform the addition:

5 + 0 = 5

The answer is __.

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in this expression, so we skip this step.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents, so we skip this step.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We cannot apply this operation directly to this expression, as it involves concatenation (C) and addition (+). Prime Factor Counting (F) comes before Addition and Subtraction (AS), so we move on to the next step.
4. Multiplication and Division (MD): There is no multiplication or division in this expression, so we skip this step.
5. Addition and Subtraction (AS): In this step, we perform the addition operation (+). We cannot perform concatenation (@) inside the addition operation. So, we first evaluate the addition part.

5 + 2 = 7 (The addition part evaluates to 7)

6. Concatenation (C): In this step, we perform the Concatenation operation (C) since it comes after Addition and Subtraction (AS) in the updated order of operations.

Since we have the result 7, we cannot concatenate it with anything in this expression, so the concatenation part is not relevant in this case. However, if we had an expression like 5 + 2 @ 4 or 5 @ (2 + 4), we would need to solve these parts separately before concatenating.

Final answer: szThere is no final answer in this expression as concatenation is not applied. Instead, this expression could be part of a larger expression that would be solved eventually using the PEFMDASC order.

Instead, the focus should be on understanding how to properly apply each step of the updated order of operations, as demonstrated here with the provided 5+2 @ 4 expression."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt3_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the PEFMDASC order, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (#)
The given expression contains the prime factor counting operation, so let's perform that first:

4 # 3 = 0 (since there are no common prime factors between 4 and 3)

Step 2: Addition (A)
Now that we've gone through prime factor counting, we proceed to addition:

0 + 2 = 2

So, the expression 4 # 3 + 2 evaluates to 2.

The answer is 2."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 6@(14+4) + 12-2 with the new mathematical operations and updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow the steps below:

Step 1: Parentheses (P):
  Solve the expression inside the parentheses first: 14 + 4 = 18

Step 2: Exponents (E):
  Since there are no exponents present in the expression, we can move on to the next step.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F):
  First, let's calculate the prime factor counting for 6 and 18:
  6 # 18 = 3 (since the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, prime factors of 18 are 2, 3, and 3, and 2 and 3 are shared twice)

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D, from left to right):
  Next, perform the multiplication operation: 6 @ 18 = 618

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S, from left to right):
  First, do the subtraction: 12 - 2 = 10
  Then, perform the addition: 618 + 10 = 628

Now, let's proceed with the second part of the expression, which is # 3:

Step 1: Parentheses (P):
  There are no parentheses present in this part of the expression.

Step 2: Exponents (E):
  Since there are no exponents present in the second part of the expression, we can move on to the next step.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F):
  3 # 3 = 1 (since prime factors of 3 are only 3 and there is only one shared prime factor, hence count = 1)

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D, from left to right):
  Since there are no multiplication or division operations present in this expression, we can proceed to the next step.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S, from left to right):
  0 (since the prime factor counting for 3 is 1, and for 0 is 0)

Step 6: Concatenation (C):
  Since there is no concatenation operation present in this part of the expression, we don't need to perform this step.

The answer is 628."
