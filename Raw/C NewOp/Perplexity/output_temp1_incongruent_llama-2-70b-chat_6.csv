Therefore, we can start by evaluating 2@4 = 2 @ 4 = 024 = 24.

Next, we need to evaluate the addition operation, which comes before the concatenation operation in the order of operations.

Thus, we have 5 + 24 = 29.

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelllama-2-70b-chat_temp1_maxtoken700,llama-2-70b-chat,1,700,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18
2. Concatenate 6 with the result of step 1: 6 @ 18 = 6 @ 18 = 108
3. Add 12: 108 + 12 = 120
4. Evaluate the prime factor counting operation: 12 # 3 = 0 (there are no shared prime factors between 12 and 3)
5. Subtract 0 from the result of step 3: 120 - 0 = 120

The answer is 120.

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

1. First, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation:
3 # 2 = 1
2. Next, we need to evaluate the addition (A) operation:
5 + 3 = 8
3. Then, we need to evaluate the concatenation (C) operation:
8 @ 2 = 16

The answer is 16.

It's important to note that in the PEFMDASC order, prime factor counting (F) comes before addition (A) and concatenation (C) operations. This ensures that we correctly calculate the shared prime factors between the absolute values of the numbers before performing any arithmetic operations."
