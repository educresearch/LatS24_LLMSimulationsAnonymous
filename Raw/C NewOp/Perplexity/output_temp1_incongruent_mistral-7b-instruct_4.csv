systemPrompt1_userPrompt2_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the problem using the new order of operations, we first need to identify which operations need to be performed first based on the expanded order of operations (PEFMDASC).

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): The prime factor counting operation comes before addition in the expanded order of operations, so we need to perform it first for each number.

For 8: Prime factors are 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 16, so # of unique prime factors is 4.

For 2: Prime factors are 2, so # of unique prime factors is 1.

For 6: Prime factors are 2 x 2 x 3 = 6.

2. Addition (A): Since # operation was performed before the addition, we can now add the results of the prime factor counting operation. So, 4 (from 8) + 1 (from 2) = 5.

1. Parentheses: Solve the expression inside the parentheses
14 + 4 = 18

2. Prime factor counting (F): Since there are no multiplication, division, or negative numbers we need to evaluate prime factor counting, but it is irrelevant for this example as the result will always be zero.

3. Exponents: None in the given expression.

4. Multiplication and Division (MD): Concatenation (@) is neither multiplication nor division, so we skip this step.

5. Addition and Subtraction (AS): Two addition (+) operations are present, so we solve them from left to right.

6. Concatenation (C): Last operation.

6 @ (18) + 12 - 2#3

≈ First, perform the operation inside the parentheses:

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:

                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.

                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)

                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)

systemPrompt3_userPrompt1_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 5 + 2@4, we need to follow the new updated order of operations, which is PEFMDASC. In this case, we have parentheses (represented by the @ symbol for concatenation in this expression), so we will begin with that.

First, we evaluate the concatenation operation:
2@4 = 24

Now, we have 5 + 24. Since addition comes before concatenation, we will perform the addition:

24 + 5 = 29

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 29."

systemPrompt3_userPrompt2_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem using the new mathematical operations and order of operations, we need to follow the PEFMDASC rule. Since there are no parentheses or exponents, we'll start with prime factor counting (F).

First, we calculate the prime factor counting for each number:

8 = 2³ * 2
2 = 2

6 = 2² * 2 * 3

Now we have 2 common prime factors - 2, so the prime factor counting result is 2.

Next, we move on to multiplication and division (M/D). Since there are no division signs, we only have multiplication. We follow the left-to-right rule and perform the multiplication:

2 (prime factor counting) * 2² (power) * 2 * 3
= 2 * 4 * 2 * 3
= 2 * 8 * 3

We continue by performing the addition (A/S) from left to right. Since there are no subtraction signs, we only have addition:

2 * 8 * 3 = 192

Finally, as our last step, we perform the concatenation (C). Since neither 8 nor 2 have a concatenation sign, we perform concatenation with the result we obtained from multiplication and addition, which is 192. However, since there is no concatenation sign in the given problem, its value should be considered as a separate number.

So, the correct solution is:

The answer is 192."

1. Parentheses: Solve the expression inside the parentheses first.

2. Exponents: There are no exponents present.

3. Prime Factor Counting (#): Calculate the unique prime factors common to the numbers being compared. In this problem, we have 6, 18, and 3.

For 6 and 18: Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and prime factors of 18 are 2 and 3 (twice). Since there are two 2's and one 3 among the prime factors of both 6 and 18, the prime factor counting gives us a result of 2.

For 6 and 3: Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and prime factors of 3 are only 3. Since there's no common prime factor between 6 and 3, the prime factor counting result is 0.

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): Perform multiplication and division in the order they appear from left to right.

In this problem, there is no multiplication or division present.

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Perform addition and subtraction in the order they appear from left to right.

1. Prime factor counting (#) operation should be done before addition (A): 
   Since there is no prime factor count for the given digits, the answer is 0.

So, the problem boils down to 5 + 3.

2. Addition (A) operation is performed next:

Step 2: Complete any exponentiation (E). There are no exponents in this problem, so we move on to the next operation in the order.

Step 3: Perform Prime Factor Counting (F). In this problem, we don't have the values of 'a' and 'b' to perform Prime Factor Counting, so we move on to the next operation in the order.

Step 4: Multiply and divide from left to right (M/D). In this problem, we don't have any multiplication or division, so we move on to the next operation in the order.

Step 5: Add and subtract from left to right (A/S). Our first operation is @ which is concatenation and it comes after addition and subtraction in the given order of operations. Since there's no need to perform addition and subtraction currently, we move on to the next operation in the order.

Step 6: Perform the Concatenation (C). In this problem, we have '5 + 2@4'. The '@' symbol represents the Concatenation operation. We perform concatenation on the numbers that are right next to it, which are '2' and '4'. So, the operation becomes '5 + 2@4' -> '5 + 24'

1. Calculate prime factor counts for the individual terms:
   a = 8
   Prime factors of 8: 2, 2, 2, 2
   Therefore, the count of unique prime factors for 8 is 4 (denoted as 4 here instead of the symbol # for better understanding).

   b = 2

   Therefore, the count of unique prime factors for 2 is 1.

   c = 6

   Therefore, the count of unique prime factors for 6 is 3.

2. Now, calculate prime factor counts for expressions with the symbol @ and #:

   a # (b + c)
   Since we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first, we calculate the prime factor counts for b + c:

   b + c = 2 + 6 = 8
   So, we have: 8 # 8

   The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2, 2 (4 times). The prime factors common to the two numbers we're comparing are 2. Therefore, the prime factor count here is:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
First, calculate the prime factor counts for both terms (4 and 3) since they should be evaluated before any arithmetic operations.
The prime factorization of 4 is 2 * 2 * 2 * 1 = 2^3 * 1
The prime factorization of 3 is 3 * 1
Since there are no shared prime factors, the prime factor count is 0.

2. Addition (A):
Now that we have completed the prime factor count operation, we can proceed with addition.
0 + 2 = 2 (So the sum of 0 and 2 is 2.)

The answer is 2."

First, we need to address the expression inside the parentheses (14 + 4).
1. Evaluate addition: 18

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting
Next, we calculate the prime factor count of the result and the numbers involved in the next operations.
1. a = 18
2. b = 6
3. c = 14 (from parentheses)
4. d = 4

a # c = 1 (There is only 1 shared prime factor 2 between 18 and 14, while the others are 2, 3, and 3 for 18 and 2 for 14)
a # d = 0 (Since there are no shared prime factors between 18 and 4)
c # d = 1 (Since there is only 1 shared prime factor 2 between 14 and 4, but since we're dealing with numbers in this problem, both 14 and 4 are positive in this case)

Step 3: Multiplication and Division
Since there are no multiplication or division operations between digits, we will move on to the next operation, which is addition and subtraction.

Step 4: Addition and Subtraction
Now, we need to handle the addition (+) and subtraction (-) signs, following their left-to-right order.
1. Subtraction: 18 - 2 = 16
