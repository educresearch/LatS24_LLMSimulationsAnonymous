mistral-7b-instruct,1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to perform prime factor counting (F) before addition (S). 

Let's analyze the given expression step by step:

1. Prime factor counting (F): In this case, we're looking for unique prime factors in the numbers 4 and 3. The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2. The prime factors of 3 are 3. Since there are no common prime factors, the result of the prime factor counting operation would be, as per the examples (0).

So, 4 # 3 = 0.

Therefore, the expression 4 # 3 + 2 translates to:

0 + 2 (since we need to perform addition before concatenation).

The answer is __.
Answer: 2.","GPT Response: Since the given expression 4 # 3 + 2 involves prime factor counting (F), addition (A), and concatenation (C) operations, we need to follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC.

First, we perform the prime factor counting operation (F):
Since the primes factors of |4| are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of |3| are 3 and |2|, and those of |2| are 2, we have a total of 3 unique shared prime factors between the digits of 4, 3, and 2.

Then, since addition comes before concatenation (A > C), we perform the addition operation:
3 + 2 = 5

Finally, we have the concatenation of the digits of the absolute values of 4 and 3 and the result of the addition, 5, which forms the final answer:
The answer is 435.","GPT Response: To solve the problem following the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to perform prime factor counting (F) between the given numbers:

4 # 3 + 2

Since there are no parentheses, exponents or multiplication/division involved, we'll proceed with concatenation (C) and addition/subtraction (A/S).

Concatenation of 4 and 3: The shared prime factor count is 0 because the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. So, the concatenation is 43.

Addition: 43 + 2 = 45

Therefore, the final answer is:
The answer is 45.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the PEFMDASC order, follow these steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): First, calculate the prime factor counting for 4 and 3. Since prime factors for 4 are 2 and 2, and prime factors for 3 are 3, there is no shared prime factor, so the prime factor counting is 0.

2. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Since there is no addition or subtraction inside any parentheses, we proceed to the next operation in the order. There is an addition sign (+) between the prime factor counting step and the concatenation operation. The expression to add is 0 (prime factor counting) and 2, so:

   The answer is 2.

In summary:
Since the prime factor counting operation resulted in 0, and the next operation in the order is addition, the result of 4 # 3 + 2 is 2."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: Based on the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation. In this case, we have 3#2.

Since the prime factorization of 3 is 3, and the prime factorization of 2 is 2, there is only one prime factor 2 that is shared between the two numbers 3 and 2. So, the result of 3#2 is 1.

Therefore, the solution to the given problem is:

The answer is 5 + 1 = 6.","GPT Response: Given the Mathematics problem 5 + 3#2, we need to follow the newly updated order of operations PEFMDASC.

Firstly, we identify which operations to perform based on the order: # (Prime Factor Counting) and + (Addition). Since Prime Factor Counting is before Addition, we will perform 3#2 first:

3#2 = 1 (since prime factors of 3 are 3 and 3, and prime factors of 2 are 2, we have 1 shared prime factor, thus the result is 1)

Now, we have 5 + 1. Since addition is before concatenation, we perform the addition:

5 + 1 = 6

The answer is 6.","GPT Response: Given problem: 5 + 3#2

Explanation:

We follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC. Since the problem does not contain any parentheses or exponents, we start with the prime factor counting (F).

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): We find the prime factors common to |3| and |2|. They are both 2, so we have 2 shared prime factors. Given that, the prime factor counting result is 2.

2. Multiplication and Division (M/D): Since there is no multiplication or division in the expression, we move on to the next operation.

3. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): 
We perform the addition (5 + 3), getting an intermediate result of 8.

4. Concatenation (C): However, since there is no concatenation sign present in the expression (only prime factor counting has been applied so far), we cannot evaluate the concatenation operation yet.

The final answer: Since we did not get the chance to evaluate the concatenation operation, the result we have obtained (8) cannot serve as the final answer. In fact, performing concatenation with the result we have obtained will lead to an incorrect answer, as the problem does not contain any information about concatenating numbers. Therefore, the problem as given does not make sense with the newly introduced operations. 

Conclusion: The problem 5 + 3#2, as given, does not have a valid solution using the new mathematical operations introduced.","GPT Response: To solve this problem following the updated PEFMDASC order, we first need to understand the meaning of the ""#"" symbol, which stands for Prime Factor Counting. In this case, we'll count the number of unique prime factors that are present in the absolute values of the numbers involved.

Step 1: Absolute values of the numbers
The prime factor counts can only be determined considering the absolute values. So, let's find the absolute values of the numbers.

5 + 3#2
=> |5| + |3| # |2|

Step 2: Calculate the Absolute Values
The absolute values of 5 and 3 are:
|5| = 5
|3| = 3

Step 3: Perform Prime Factor Counting (#)
First, let's find the unique prime factors of numbers 5 and 2. The prime factors of number 5 are 5 itself. Now let's find the prime factors of number 2, which is just 2.

So, according to the problem statement (a) in the introduction:
If a = 5 and b = 2, then a # b = 1.
(since prime factors of 5 is 5 and prime factors of 2 is 2, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2, and there is only one prime factor for each number)

Step 4: Addition (A)
Now, we perform the addition operation:
5 + 1 = 6

So the answer is:

Since addition is before concatenation in the new order, we first perform the addition operation:

5 + 2 = 7

Now that we've obtained the result from the addition operation (which is a single digit), we can proceed with concatenation. Since concatenation is a right-associative operation, we simply ""attach"" the result of the addition to the rightmost number given in the problem:

1. Parentheses:
   = (14 + 4)
   = 18

2. Exponents: None in this problem
3. Prime Factor Counting:
   = 6 @ 18 # 3

4. Multiplication and Division (L to R):
   We do not have any multiplication or division operators in this problem.

5. Addition and Subtraction (L to R):

   = 6 @ 18

Until here, we have evaluated the parentheses, prime factor counting, and addition and subtraction. The only operation left to be performed is concatenation.

Now, let us calculate the concatenation:

The answer is 618.","GPT Response: To solve this problem with the new mathematical operations and the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to apply the operations inside the parentheses, which is the addition operation between 14 and 4.

1. Evaluate the operation inside the parentheses:
   Addition (A): 14 + 4 = 18

2. Apply concatenation (C) to the result obtained from the above step and the number 6.
   Concatenation (C): 18 @ 6

3. The prime factor counting (F) operation cannot be applied yet, as there are no numbers for it to be operated on. Let's continue applying the other operations in the given order of operations.

4. Apply multiplication (M): Since there is no division in the current expression, we move directly to multiplication. The expression to operate is the result from step 2 and number 12.
   Multiplication (M): 6@18 * 12

5. Perform concatenation (C) operation on the multiplication result and the number -2.
   Concatenation (C): (6@18 * 12) @ -2

6. The first operation to perform is prime factor counting (F) since it comes before exponents (E) and the current expression doesn't have any exponents. We need to find the unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of the concatenation result and number 3.
   Since the concatenation result and number 3 are different, and neither has any common prime factors, their prime factorization is 0. This means there are no shared prime factors. Therefore, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 0.

7. Now that we have obtained the result of the prime factor counting operation, we can continue the order of operations as follows:

   Subtraction (S): Perform the subtraction between concatenation result (-2) and 0.
   Subtraction (S): -2 - 0 = -2

   Addition (A): (6@18 * 12 @ -2) + (-2)

3. Prime Factor Counting: We perform prime factor counting on 6 and 18. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 18 are 2 and 2 and 3, so there are 2 unique prime factors common to both: 2. Therefore, 6 # 18 = 2.

4. Multiplication and Division (left to right): Since there is no multiplication or division, we move on to the next operation.

5. Addition and Subtraction (left to right): We first perform the subtraction since it is the leftmost operation in the addition and subtraction group. 

   12 - 2 = 10.

2. Now that we have the result of the addition operation, we can perform the prime factor counting (F) operation.
   There are no common prime factors between 18 and 6, so the prime factor counting result is 0.

3. Since we cannot directly perform concatenation (C) operation with numbers, let's move on to the next operation which is Multiplication/Division (M/D) because there is no exponentiation in this problem.
   There are no multiplication or division signs in this expression, so we'll move to the next operation.

4. We have Addition/Subtraction (A) operations, so we can perform them left to right.
   Subtraction: 12 - 2 = 10
   
5. Now, we apply the concatenation operation (C) to the result we obtained in step 6 (10) and the result from the expression inside the parentheses (18).

For 8: Prime factors = {2, 2, 2, 2}
Number of unique prime factors = 3

For 2: Prime factors = {2}
Number of unique prime factors = 1

Now, since we need to perform prime factor counting before any other operation, we calculate the prime factor counting for both numbers and find the number of shared prime factors: 8#2 = 3 (since 2 is shared three times) and 6#6 = 1 (since there is only one 2 that is prime factor in 6).

The answer is 4.","GPT Response: First, we need to perform the prime factor counting operation for both numbers:

a) For 8: prime factors are 2^3, so the count is 3.
b) For 2: prime factors are 2^1, so the count is 1.

   b. Calculate 6#6: since the common prime factors of 6 and 6 are 2 and 2, the prime factor counting is 2.

2. Move on to the multiplication and division (M/D) operations:

6. Evaluate exponents (E):
   There are no exponents in the expression.

Now, let's evaluate the prime factor counting operations we calculated earlier in the correct order according to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC):
