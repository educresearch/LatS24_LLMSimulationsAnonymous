1. Parentheses: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first:
   14 + 4 = 18

2. Prime Factor Counting (F): Calculate the prime factor count of '6' and '18': Since the problem doesn't specify negative numbers, there are no negative signs involved, and prime factors for 6 are {2, 3} and prime factors for 18 are {2, 2, 3}, there is only one shared prime factor '2'. So, 6 # 18 = 1.

3. Concatenation (C): Concatenate '6' and the result of the parentheses expression:
   The result of the parentheses expression is '18'. So, 6 @ 18 = 618.

4. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S): Since there is an addition symbol (+) before concatenation symbol (@), perform addition first:
   618 + 12 = 630.

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1.

                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): We don't have any multiplication or division sign in this problem, but we'll remember this step since it comes before addition and subtraction in the order of operations.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We have an operation @ which is defined as concatenation. In the given expression, 5 + 2@4, we have an addition operation and a concatenation operation. However, following the PEFMDASC order, we should perform the operation inside the parentheses (if any), exponents, primer factor counting, multiplication and division (from left to right), addition and subtraction (from left to right), and finally concatenation. But in our case, there are no parentheses, exponents, prime factor counting, or multiplication and division. So, the correct order of performing the operations here is addition and subtraction (from left to right), which means we should perform the addition operation before the concatenation operation.

Two prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and two prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since there is only one prime factor (2) that is common to both 8 and 6, the prime factor counting operation 8 # 6 equals 1.

Applying the updated order of operations:

1. Prime factor counting: 8 # 6 = 1
2. Addition: 1 + 6 # 6
3. Concatenation: 1 + 6 @ 6

First, let's calculate 6 # 6:
Two prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since there are no common prime factors between these numbers, the prime factor counting operation 6 # 6 equals 0.

Now, let's calculate 1 + 6 # 6:
Since the result of the prime factor counting operation for 6 and 6 is 0, the sum of 1 and 0 equals 1.

Finally, let's calculate 1 + 6 @ 6:
Since concatenation doesn't change the value of digits, but rather merges them in the same order, 1 + 6 @ 6 equals 16.

So, the result of the mathematical expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the new mathematical operations and the updated order of operations is ""The answer is 16."""

Step 1: Parentheses
There are no parentheses in the given expression, so we move on to the next operation.

Step 2: Exponents
None in this expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (#)
Since no absolute values or negatives are present, the prime factor counting operation does not apply.

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (MD)
In this expression, we do not have any multiplication or division operations.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (AS)
We have an expression 5 + 2@4. Here, 2@4 (concatenation) is an independent operation. Let's solve this step by step:
1. First, we need to follow the order of operations and solve the concatenation operation 2@4.
2. The concatenation operation combines the digits of the given numbers. So, here, we have the digits 2 and 4 joined together, resulting in 24.
3. Now, we come back to the adding operation. As the concatenation operation is completed, we replace the 2@4 with the result 24, and the expression becomes 5 + 24.

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
Since concatenation has already been performed earlier, there's no need to apply it again in this expression.

Now, the final step:
Step 7: Subtraction
Subtract the numbers as per the order,
5 - 24 = -19

Answer: The answer is -19."

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting
First, we need to perform the prime factor counting operation for each pair of numbers. So, let's look at the prime factorization of 8, 2, 6, and 6.

8 = 2³ * 2
2 = 2
6 = 2⁵

Since 8 and 2 do not share any prime factors, their prime factor counting operation will be 0. Similarly, 6 and 6 also do not share any prime factors, so their prime factor counting operation will be 0.

Step 2: Addition
Now, having the prime factor counting results, we can move on to the addition operation. Since we follow the left to right rule for the Addition and Subtraction (A/S), we'll perform the addition from left to right.

8 # (2 + 6)

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting
Perform the prime factor counting operation for 2 and 6. Since they don't share any prime factors, the result will be 0.

8 # (2 + 6) = 8 # (8)

Step 4: Multiplication
Now, since Multiplication should be done before Addition as per the PEFMDASC order, we'll perform the multiplication of the concatenation result 8 with the result of the addition operation 8.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3 using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, let's follow these steps:

Step 1: Parentheses
= (14+4)
= 18

Step 2: Exponents
Since no exponents are present, we move on to the next operation.

Step 3: Prime factor counting (#)
To find 2#3, we need to find the prime factors of the absolute values of 2 and 3, which are both 2 and 3 as 2 and 3 are the prime factors of 2 and 3 respectively. Since there's only one unique prime factor shared between them, the prime factor count is 1.

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D, from left to right)
Since there's no multiplication or division present in the expression, we proceed to the next operation.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S, from left to right)
First, let's solve 18 + 12:

= 18 + 12
= 30

Now, we subtract 2 from 30:

= 30 - 2
= 28

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
Finally, we perform the concatenation of 6 and 18:

= 6 @ 18
= 618 (The answer is 618.)

So, the answer to the expression 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3 is 618."

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): We first calculate the prime factor count for the given numbers, 5, 3, and 2.

    - Since there is only one shared prime factor (2) between 5, 3, and 2, the prime factor count (#) of the expression 5 + 3 # 2 equals the prime factor count of 2, which is 1.

2. Addition and Subtraction (S): We perform the addition part of the expression, which is 5 and 3, since we evaluated prime factor counting before addition.
   - 5 + 3 = 8

3. Concatenation (C): Since both of our terms (8 from addition and 1 from prime factor counting) are numbers and not digits, we don't need to perform concatenation. However, if we had numbers with digits like 5 @ 3, we would concatenate them.
