In this case, the prime factor counting operation is applied to the numbers 3 and 2. Three prime factors for 3 are 3, and for 2 is 2. Since there is only one prime factor that is common between 3 and 2, the result of this operation is 1. So, 3 # 2 = 1.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate addition and subtraction (A/S). Here we have 5 + 1 (from step 1, the result of 3 # 2). We follow the left-to-right rule as per the updated order, so we first evaluate the number inside the parentheses: 1.
