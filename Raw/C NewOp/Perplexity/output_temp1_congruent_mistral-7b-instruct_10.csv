Now, we can perform the concatenation operation on the result.

2. Exponents
3. Prime Factor Counting
4. Multiplication and Division (left to right)
5. Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
6. Concatenation

Given expression is 4 # 3 + 2.

Since the expression does not contain any parentheses, exponents, or concatenation, we will start with prime factor counting:

1. Prime Factor Counting: In this case, we have to check the common prime factors between 4 and 3. The prime factors of 3 are 3, and the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2. Since there is no common prime factor between 3 and 4, the prime factor count is 0.

Now, we will move to the next operation in the order:

2. Addition and Subtraction (left to right): In this expression, we already performed the addition operation implicitly when we wrote ""3 + 2"" because the addition symbol (+) has a higher precedence than concatenation (C) symbol (@) according to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC). So, the expression ""3 + 2"" evaluates to 5. Therefore, the expression becomes ""4 # 5.""

Based on the given prime factor count rule, we know that the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2. Since the prime factors of 5 are 5, there are no common prime factors between 4 and 5. Hence, Prime Factor Count # (""#"") operation results in 0.

Therefore, based on the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), the expression 4 # 3 + 2 evaluates to 0.

The answer is 0."

                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.

                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)

                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)

First, we deal with parentheses if present, but in this case, there are no parentheses.

Next, we evaluate exponents, if any. However, there are no exponents in this expression.

We then proceed to prime factor counting (F) which is represented as a @ b. In this case, we have the digits '5' and '2' for operation 'a @ b'. Prime factorization of '5' is '5', and prime factorization of '2' is '2'. Since they both have only one prime factor, their concatenation is '52'.

Now, we deal with multiplication and division (M/D). In this expression, there is neither multiplication nor division.

After multiplication and division, we proceed to addition and subtraction (A/S), but in this case, we have only addition sign (+). So, we evaluate this operation.

Finally, we perform concatenation (C), which involves combining the result of the previous operations. In this expression, there is only one operation, which is concatenation itself. Therefore, the result of the concatenation of '5' and '2' is the final answer.

systemPrompt3_userPrompt2_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem with the new mathematical operations and updated order of operations, we need to follow the order of PEFMDASC. Since there are no parentheses or exponents involved, we will begin with prime factor counting.

Given problem: 8#2 + 6#6

We first calculate the prime factor counting for each number:

1. For 8: 2^3
2. For 2: 2

Since there is only one unique shared prime factor (2), the prime factor counting result is: 1

Now, we move to the next operation in the order, which is multiplication and division. Since there are no division signs in the given expressions, only multiplication is left to be calculated; that is, we need to calculate 6#6.

The prime factor counting for 6 is 2^2 and 3. Since the prime factor 3 is already in 6 and does not appear in 6 (from the problem), the shared prime factor between 6 and 6 is only 2. Thus, the result of prime factor counting for 6#6 will be 1 as well.

Since we have reached the end of multiplication and division stage in the order, we proceed to addition and subtraction. In this case, it is an addition operation. Since both numbers have already been calculated (1 from 8#2 and 1 from 6#6) and the prime factor counting result for both numbers are 1, the answer to the sum 1 + 1 = 2.

Therefore, the result of the given mathematical problem, 8#2 + 6#6, is:

The answer is 2."

systemPrompt3_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: The given problem is a simple addition and prime factor counting operation. To solve this problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations as given: PEFMDASC. Since there are no parentheses, exponents, or concatenation involved, we can start with the given expression:

5 + 3#2

Per the order of operations:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): First, we need to identify the unique prime factors common to |3| and |2| which is 2, so 3#2 = 2.
2. Addition (A): Now, we can add the result of the prime factor counting and 5.

The answer is 5 + 2 = 7."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt3_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the PEFMDASC order, follow these steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Let's find the unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 4 and 3, and between 4 and 2:
   a. For 4 and 3: Since the prime factors of 4 are 2² and 2³, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3, there is no shared prime factor. So, 4 # 3 = 0.
   b. For 4 and 2: The prime factors of 4 are 2² and 2³, and those of 2 are just 2. There is one shared prime factor, 2. So, 4 # 2 = 1.

2. Multiply/Divide (M/D): Since there is no division in this expression, we can skip this step.

3. Exponents (E): Since there is no exponent in this expression, we can skip this step.

4. Prime Factor Counting (F) again: Now, let's find the unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of the result from step 1, and the number 2:
   a. For 0 and 2: Since there are no shared prime factors between 0 and 2, 0 # 2 = 0.

5. Addition/Subtraction (A/S): Perform the addition operation with the result from step 4 and the number 2:
   a. 0 + 2 = 2

6. Concatenation (C): Since there is no concatenation between multiple numbers in this expression, we can skip this step.

The answer is 2."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)

                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.
