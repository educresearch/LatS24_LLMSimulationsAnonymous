mistral-7b-instruct,1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: The given expression is ""4#3 + 2"" based on the new order of operations, we first perform prime factor counting:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): 
   The prime factor counting of 4 is 2 (since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2), and the prime factor counting of 3 is also 2. Since there are two shared prime factors, the prime factor counting of 4 and 3 is 2.

Now that we have the result of the prime factor counting operation, the next operation in the order is addition:

2. Addition (S):
   We have the result of prime factor counting which is 2, and the addend 2. The sum of 2 and 2 is 4.

So, the solution to the given problem using the expanded order of operations PEFMDASC is:

4 (prime factor counting of 4) # 3 (prime factor counting of 3) + 2 (addition)
= 2 (prime factor counting result) + 2 
= 4.

The answer is 4.","GPT Response: The given expression is 4#3 + 2. According to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to perform prime factor counting:

1. To compute 4#3, we calculate the prime factorization of both 4 and 3:
   Prime factors of 4: 2 and 2
   Prime factors of 3: 3
   There is no common prime factor between 2 and 3, so the result is 0.

2. Now, we calculate the addition:
   Since prime factor counting is before addition according to the order of operations, we have:
   0 + 2 = 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve this problem based on the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to perform prime factor counting (F) for the given numbers 4 and 3.

Prime factor count (F) for 4: The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
Prime factor count (F) for 3: Prime factors of 3 are only 3.

Since there are no common prime factors between 4 and 3, the result of prime factor counting (4 # 3) is 0.

Now that the prime factor counting is done, we move on to performing addition (A). In our given expression '4#3 + 2', the addition should be performed once we have the results from the prime factor counting.

So the calculation:

4#3 = 0
0 + 2 = 2

Therefore, the final answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 following the PEFMDASC order:

Step 1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
First, we need to find the number of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 4 and 3. However, since both numbers have the same absolute value (|4| = |3| = 1 and the unique prime factors for each are 2), we have 1 prime factor shared, so the result of this step is 1.

Step 2. Concatenation (C):
Since addition comes before concatenation, we need to postpone the concatenation until the end. So, we move to the next operation.

Step 3. Multiplication and Division (M/D):
We don't have any multiplication or division in this expression. So, we skip this step.

Step 4. Exponents (E):
Likewise, we don't have any exponents in our expression. Therefore, we proceed to the next step.

Step 5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S):
Now, we have an addition operation, which exceeds our prime factor counting step. Therefore, we evaluate this operation:

4 # 3 + 2 = 1 (from step 1) + 2 = 3

Step 6. Concatenation (C):
Since we have now finished evaluating all the operations except the concatenation, we can finally perform it:

According to the new order of operations, we need to perform concatenation before addition. Therefore, the expression 5 + 2@4 should be solved as follows:

1. First, we perform the concatenation operation (C): 2@4 = 24.
2. Next, we perform the addition operation (A): 5 + 24 = 29.

The given expression is 5 + 2@4.

First, we identify the concatenation operation (@). We need to perform concatenation before addition, so we need to find the result of the concatenation of 2 and 4:

2@4 = 24

Now, the expression becomes 5 + 24.

Next, we look for addition (+) operation. We need to perform addition from left to right, so we need to add 5 and the result we got from the concatenation, which is 24:

5 + 24 = 29

The final answer is: The answer is 29.","GPT Response: To solve the problem 5 + 2@4, we need to follow the updated order of operations, which is PEFMDASC. The symbols ""@"" represent Concatenation and ""#"" represent Prime Factor Counting.

First, we need to evaluate the Concatenation operation, which comes before addition in the order of operations. In this case, there is no concatenation since there is only one ""@"" symbol, and it is not between any numbers.

Next, since there are no parentheses or exponents in this problem, we can skip those steps.

Now, we have Multiplication and Division (left to right). However, there is no multiplication or division symbol in this problem.

After Multiplication and Division, we have Addition and Subtraction (left to right). In this problem, we have the number 5 and the addition sign (+) and the digits 2 and 4, which are concatenated.

Since we need to evaluate the concatenation before addition, we first consider the digits 2 and 4 and concatenate them to make 24. Now we add 5 to the result:

The answer is 5 + 24 = 29.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 2@4 using the given order of operations PEFMDASC:

Step 1: Identify the operations, left to right: + (addition), @ (concatenation)

Step 2: Apply concatenation (C): Since concatenation has a lower precedence than multiplication and division, it needs to be done before them. In our case, there's no multiplication or division present.

Step 3: In this step, we'll do the addition (A). Since addition has a lower precedence than multiplication and division, it still needs to be done after concatenation.

So, in your problem statement, the ' '@' symbol represents concatenation, not multiplication or division. Based on the order of operations PEFMDASC, the correct calculation is as follows:

Step 1: Recognize the operations: + (addition), @ (concatenation)

Step 2: Apply concatenation (C): Since concatenation (C) has a lower precedence than multiplication and division (M/D), it needs to be done before them. In your problem statement, there are no multiplication or division operations present. Therefore, we directly go to the step 3.

Step 3: Addition (A): Now, we'll do the addition.

5 + 2@4

Since there are no common prime factors between 5 and 3, the prime factor count for 5 and 3 is 0. However, since there is a common prime factor, 2, between 5 and 2, the prime factor count for 5 and 2 is 1.

4. Multiplication and Division (MD): None in this problem.
5. Addition and Subtraction (AS): We are asked to perform addition (5 + 3) before prime factor counting (F).

5 + 3 # 2

Since there is no prime factorization inside parentheses, we will proceed with prime factor counting first:
5 # 2 = 0 (no shared prime factors)

Next, we perform multiplication and division from left to right:

Since prime factor counting (F) comes before addition (A), we need to first find the prime factors common to 3 and 2, which are 2. The prime factor counting (#) operation returns the number of unique prime factors shared between the two numbers. As there is only one prime factor (2) common to both 3 and 2, the prime factor counting (#) operation results in 1, which can be considered as 1 * 1.

8 # 2:
The prime factorization of 8 is 2^3 and the prime factorization of 2 is 2. Since 2 is not a repeated prime factor between the two numbers, the prime factor count is 0. Thus, 8 # 2 = 0.
