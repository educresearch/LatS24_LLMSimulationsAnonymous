mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first evaluate the concatenation operation (C) because it comes before addition (A). So we compute 2 @ 4:

2 @ 4 = 24

Now we can perform the addition:

5 + 24 = 29

So the answer is:

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the new order of operations PEFMDASC.

First, we perform the prime factor counting operation for both numbers:

8 # 2 = 1 (since the only prime factor of 8 is 2 and of 2 is 2, and 1 shared prime factor)

6 # 6 = 2 (since the only prime factor of 6 is 2 and 3, and of 6 is 2 and 3, and 2 shared prime factors)

Then, we perform the addition operation:

The answer is 1 + 2.

So, the answer is 3."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: Following the new order of operations, we first evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F), then the addition operation (A).

4 # 3 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor is 2, but it appears once in 4 and twice in 3; thus, no shared prime factor)

So, the expression becomes:

1 + 2

Finally, we perform the addition operation (A):

The answer is 3."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: Let's go through the operations step by step, following the new order of operations.

1. First, calculate the expression in the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18.
2. Next, concatenate 6 and 18: 6 @ 18 = 618.
3. Then, perform the addition: 618 + 12 = 630.
4. Lastly, calculate the prime factor counting of 2 and 3: 2 # 3 = 0 (since they have no shared prime factors).
5. Finally, subtract the count from the previous result: 630 - 0 = 630.

The answer is 630."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F) between 3 and 2. They do not share any prime factors, so 3 # 2 = 0.

5 + 0

The answer is 5."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Let's break down the expression using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in this expression.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this expression.
3. Prime Factor counting (F): We don't have any absolute values in this expression, so we can directly perform operation F. However, there are no instances of operation F in the expression either.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There are no multiplication or division signs in this expression.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Now, we look for addition and subtraction signs in the expression. We find that there is an addition sign: 5 + 2 @ 4.
6. Concatenation (C): So, we perform the concatenation operation: 2 @ 4 = 24
7. Finally, we perform the addition: 5 + 24 = 29

The answer is 29."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we must follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), which includes the prime factor counting operation (F) and the concatenation operation (C).

First, we perform the prime factor counting operation (F) for both 8 # 2 and 6 # 6:

8 # 2:
Prime factors of 8: 2, 2, 2
Prime factors of 2: 2
Shared prime factors: 2
There is 1 shared prime factor, so 8 # 2 = 1.

6 # 6:
Prime factors of 6: 2, 3
Prime factors of 6: 2, 3
Shared prime factors: 2, 3
There are 2 shared prime factors, so 6 # 6 = 2.

Now we have:
8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 2

So, we perform addition (A):

1 + 2 = 3

Therefore, the answer is 3."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we must follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), which includes the prime factor counting (F) operation.

Given expression: 4 # 3 + 2

First, we perform the prime factor counting (F) operation on 4 and 3:
Prime factors of 4: 2, 2
Prime factors of 3: 3
Since there are no shared prime factors, 4 # 3 = 0.

Now, we have: 0 + 2

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: To solve the expression $6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 	o 3$, we follow the order of operations PEFMDASC.

First, perform the operation inside the parentheses: $14 + 4 = 18$.

Then, concatenate $6$ and $18$: $6 @ 18 = 618$.

Now, perform subtraction: $618 + 12 - 2$. We do subtraction from left to right, so first $618 + 12 = 630$. Then, subtract $2$: $630 - 2 = 628$.

Lastly, perform the prime factor counting operation: $2 	o 3$. The prime factors of $2$ are $2$, and the prime factors of $3$ are $3$. Since there are no shared prime factors between $2$ and $3$, $2 	o 3 = 0$.

So, $6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 	o 3 = 628 + 0 = 628$.

The answer is 628."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) before the addition (A).

First, we find the prime factors of the absolute values of 3 and 2, which are 3 and 2, respectively. They share no prime factors, so 3 # 2 = 0.

Now, we can proceed to the addition: 5 + 0 = 5.

First, let's calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) for the left side of the addition:

8 # 2 = 4 (since 8 has prime factors 2, 2, 2 and 2 has prime factor 2)

Now, for the right side of the addition:

6 # 6 = 2 (since 6 has prime factors 2, 3 and 6 has prime factors 2, 3 as well; hence, they share 2 prime factors)

Now, we can proceed to Addition (A):

4 + 2 = 6

So, the answer is:

The answer is 6."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC). 

First, we calculate the prime factor counting (F) for 4 and 3. The prime factors of 4 are 2, 2 and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since they don't have any common prime factors, 4 # 3 equals 0.

1. Parentheses: Calculate the expression within the parentheses first, 14 + 4 = 18.
2. Prime Factor Counting (F): We have an F operation before addition, so we calculate 2 # 3 = 1 because the only shared prime factor between 2 and 3 is 1.
3. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We now have addition and subtraction mixed together, so we'll calculate them from left to right:
   a. 6 @ 18 = 618
   b. The addition step is now completed, so we move on to subtraction. 618 - 1 = 617

The answer is 617.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: Step 1: Calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation for the first pair of numbers, 8 and 2.
8 # 2 = 2 (since the prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2, 2 and the prime factors of 2 are 2, so they share 1 prime factor, 2)

Step 2: Calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation for the second pair of numbers, 6 and 6.
6 # 6 = 2 (since the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and for 6 it's again 2 and 3, so they share 1 prime factor, 2)

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: Let's tackle this problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. Parentheses: Calculate the expression within the parentheses first, 14 + 4 = 18.
So, we now have 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3
2. Prime Factor Counting (F): Determine the prime factor counting for 2 # 3. The prime factor of 2 is 2 and for 3 is 3; they don't have any common prime factors, so 2 # 3 = 0.
So, we now have 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0
3. Concatenation (C): Perform concatenation for 6 @ 18, resulting in 618.
So, we now have 618 + 12 - 0
4. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): In the revised order, we consider addition and subtraction from left to right. First, perform 618 + 12, resulting in 630.
Now, we have 630 - 0

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: Let's solve this problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): There are no multiplication, division, exponents, or parentheses in the problem, so we don't perform any operations yet.
2. Addition (A): Now we have the operation 5 + 3, but since we have not yet evaluated the Prime Factor Counting operation, we keep it as is for now.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We now evaluate 3 # 2, which is the count of unique prime factors shared between 3 and 2. Since the prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factor of 2 is 2, there are no shared prime factors. Therefore, 3 # 2 = 0.
4. Addition (A): Now we go back to the operation we skipped before: 5 + 3. With the result from step 3, we can now evaluate this operation: 5 + 3 = 8.

The answer is 8."
