systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: First, we need to follow the order of operations (PEFMDASC) and evaluate the expression in parentheses:

6 @ (14 + 4) = 6 @ 18

Next, do the concatenation operation:

6 @ 18 = 618

Now, continue with the next step in the order of operations, which is the prime factor counting (F) operation:

618 # 3

To find the prime factors of 618 and 3, we have:
Prime factors of 618: 2, 3, 103
Prime factors of 3: 3

They share one prime factor, 3. So:

618 # 3 = 1

Finally, we move on to the addition and subtraction step in the order of operations, but in this example, we only have subtraction:

618 - 2

                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

First, calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) for 3 and 2:
Prime factors of 3 are 3 and prime factors of 2 are 2. However, they don't have any common prime factors, so 3 # 2 equals 0.

Now, we are left with the expression 5 + 0.

Finally, perform the Addition (A):
5 + 0 = 5

The expression is: 5 + 2 @ 4

Step 1: Perform the Concatenation operation (C).
There are no exponents, parentheses, multiplication, division, prime factor counting, or addition to be performed first, so we proceed directly to the concatenation operation.

5 + 2 @ 4
= 5 + 24 (since 2 @ 4 = 24)

Step 2: Perform the Addition operation (A).
Now that the concatenation operation has been performed, we can proceed to the addition operation.

The expression: 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3

Following PEFMDASC, we first address the operation inside the parentheses:

14 + 4 = 18

Now the expression becomes: 6@18 + 12-2 # 3

Next, we evaluate the Concatenation operation (C):

6@18 = 68

Now the expression becomes: 68 + 12-2 # 3

We continue according to PEFMDASC and perform the Addition and Subtraction operations (A and S):

68 + 12 = 80
80 - 2 = 78

Now the expression becomes: 78 # 3

We evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operation (F):

78 has prime factors 2 and 3, and 3 has a prime factor of 3
However, these prime factors are not shared between 78 and 3

Thus, 78 # 3 = 0

The answer is 0."
