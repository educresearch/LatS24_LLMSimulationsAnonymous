So, the problem now reduces to 5 + 24.<br><br>Now, we evaluate the addition operation. Here, we have the number 5 and the digit sequence "24". Since the digits of a number are evaluated from left to right during addition, we add the first digit of each number (5 and 2) and carry the result if necessary.

Parentheses: None present, so we move on to the next operation.<br>2. Exponents: None present, so we move on to the next operation.<br>3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We do not have the absolute values of the given numbers, so we cannot perform the prime factor counting operation. The expression 5 + 2 @ 4 is made up of integers without any signs, so all numbers are considered positive.<br>4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): The concatenation operation (@) takes precedence over multiplication and division, so we cannot perform multiplication and division until after the concatenation operation is completed. Since there is no multiplication or division in the expression 5 + 2 @ 4, we move on to the next operation.<br>5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Addition has higher precedence than concatenation, but in this case, we already performed concatenation during prime factor counting since we had to find the absolute values of numbers to perform prime factor counting.
