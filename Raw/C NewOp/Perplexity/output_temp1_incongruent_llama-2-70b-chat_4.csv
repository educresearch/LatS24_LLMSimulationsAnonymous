systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelllama-2-70b-chat_temp1_maxtoken700,llama-2-70b-chat,1,700,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

First, we evaluate the prime factor counting (F) between 3 and 2, which gives us 1.

Next, we add 5 and 3, which gives us 8.

Finally, we concatenate 8 with 2, which gives us 82.

Therefore, the final answer is 82."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:

2. Next, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting: 5 # 8 = 5 # 4 = 1

1. First, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation: 4#3 = 4 # 3 = 1
2. Next, we need to evaluate the addition (A) operation: 4#3 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3.

In this problem, we can see that the prime factor counting operation is evaluated first, since it is represented by the symbol #. Then, we evaluate the addition operation, which is represented by the symbol +. Finally, we concatenate the results of the prime factor counting and addition operations to get the final result, which is 3.

It's important to note that the order of operations is crucial in this problem, since evaluating the addition operation before the prime factor counting operation would give us a different result. For example, if we evaluate the addition operation first, we would get 4 + 2 = 6, and then we would evaluate the prime factor counting operation as 6 # 3 = 2, which would give us a final result of 2. However, this is not the correct order of operations, and we would get a wrong answer.

Therefore, it's important to follow the PEFMDASC order strictly, and evaluate the operations in the correct order to get the correct result."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelllama-2-70b-chat_temp1_maxtoken700,llama-2-70b-chat,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's the step-by-step explanation for the given problem using the PEFMDASC order:

1. Concatenation (C): 6 @ (14 + 4) = 6 @ 18 = 6 @ 18 = 186
2. Addition (A/S): 186 + 12 = 198
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): 198 - 2 # 3 = 198 - 1 = 197

The answer is 197.

Here's a breakdown of each step:

1. In the first step, we use concatenation to join the digits of 6 and 18 together, resulting in 186.
2. In the second step, we add 12 to 186, resulting in 198.
3. In the third step, we use prime factor counting to subtract the number of shared prime factors between 198 and 3. Since there is only one shared prime factor (2), we subtract 1 from 198, resulting in 197.

It's important to note that we need to follow the PEFMDASC order strictly to avoid mistakes. In this case, we need to evaluate the concatenation operation before adding 12, and we need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation before subtracting 2 # 3."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
