In this problem, we have the concatenation (C) operation represented by the ""@"" symbol, and the addition (A) operation represented by the ""+"" symbol.

Since addition has a lower precedence than concatenation in the new order of operations, we need to evaluate the concatenation operation first:

2 @ 4 = 24

Now, we can evaluate the addition operation:

5 + 24 = 29

1. Calculate the operation inside the parentheses:
   = 18

Now, we apply the concatenation (C) operation to the result and the number 6:

2. Concatenation (C):
   = 18 @ 6
   = 186

After that, we perform the prime factor counting (F) operation between the result and 12:

3. Prime factor counting (F):
   Since prime factors of 186 are 2, 3, and 7 and prime factors of 12 are 2 and 2, there is 1 unique shared prime factor 2. So, the result of the prime factor counting operation is:
   = 1

Next, we evaluate the subtraction (S) operation:

4. Subtraction (S):
   = 12 - 2
   = 10

Finally, since no other operations remain, the answer is the result of the concatenation and subtraction calculations:

The answer is 18610."

                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):

                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)

For 5: 5 = 5

For 2: 2 = 2

Now, we look for any shared prime factors between any pair of these numbers. Since 5 and 3 share no prime factors, and both 5 and 3 share a prime factor (1 and themselves) with 2, the shared prime factors are none. Therefore, the prime factor counting operation results in 0.

So we move on to the next operation in the priority list, which is Prime Factor Counting (F).

For the given expression, 8 # 2 + 6 # 6, we need to apply prime factor counting to each term and identify any common prime factors. Let's calculate the prime factors for each term:

1. 8: The prime factors for 8 are 2, 2, 2, and entry. Since all these factors represent the same prime number (2), and it appears more than once, we consider that there is a single shared prime factor between the two terms in the expression: 1.
2. 2: It has only one prime factor, which is 2, and it appears as a single instance.
3. 6: The prime factors for 6 are 2 and 3. Shared prime factors include 2 (which appears twice in the first term and once in the second term). So, the count of common prime factors is 1.
4. +: Since we are adding two terms, we need to wait until the end of the calculation to evaluate this operation.

Now that we have determined the common prime factors between the two terms, we can move on to the next operation in the priority list, which is Multiplication and Division (M/D). However, since there's no multiplication or division in our current expression, we proceed to the next operation, which is Addition and Subtraction (A/S).

To evaluate the terms after the addition sign:

1. 8 # 2: Since we calculated that there's 1 common prime factor, we proceed to concatenation (C). In this case, we concatenate the digits of the absolute values of these numbers, 8 and 2: 8 @ 2 = 82.
2. 6 # 6: Similarily, for this term we find that there is 1 common prime factor and then proceed to concatenation, so 6 @ 6 = 66.

Finally, since the ""+"" sign was the last operation we encountered in the order of operations, we can now evaluate it by adding the results of both terms: 82 + 66 = 148.

So, the solution to the given expression 8 # 2+6 # 6 is:

The answer is __148__.

Conclusion: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 148 (following the revised order of operations PEFMDASC)."

systemPrompt2_userPrompt4_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: According to the revised order of operations PEFMDASC, the given expression should be solved as follows:

1. Parentheses: Solve the expression inside the parentheses first.
    = (14 + 4)
    = 18

2. Prime Factor Counting (#): Since the concatenation operation (C) comes after prime factor counting in the order of operations. We should calculate the prime factor counting for the terms 6 and 18.
    For term 6: Prime factors = {2, 3} with a count of 2 for each. So, the count is 2 × 2 = 4.
    For term 18: Prime factors = {2, 2, 3, 3} with a count of 2 for each 2 and 1 for each 3. So, the count is 2 ×2 ×1 ×1 = 4.

3. Exponents: Since there are no exponents in the given expression, we may skip this step.

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D, from left to right): Since there are no multiplication or division operations left to right of the prime factor counting step, we may skip this step as well.

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S, from left to right): Now, we can perform the given subtraction and addition operations.
    = 18 @ 6 + 12 - 2#3
    = 114 @ 6 + 12 - 2#3
    = 114 @ 6 + 12 - 1 (since 2 and 3 are the prime factors of 3, and since 1 is a prime factor of every number, shared factor with number itself, there is 1 count for each number)

6. Concatenation (C): Since the concatenation operator comes after the addition operator, we perform the addition first and then concatenate the result with 6.
    = (114 + 12) @ 6
    = 126 @ 6
    = 1266.

Since there's no prime factor counting involved, the addition (A) operation can be performed next. We have 5 from the beginning, and for the @ symbol, we'll treat it as a single digit since we're dealing with addition. Therefore, we have 5 + 2@4 = 5 + 26 = 27.

The answer is 27."

1. Parentheses: Evaluate what is inside the parentheses. So, 14 + 4 = 18.
2. Prime Factor Counting: For the multiplication and division part, prime factor counting is needed. However, we don't have two numbers to find their common prime factors, so our value 2 in this case will be treated as a constant(ignored in this step).
3. Exponents: None present in the equation, so we will move on to the next operation.
4. Multiplication and Division: Multiplication and Division, from left to right: We don't have any multiplication or division symbol presented, so we will proceed to the next operation.
5. Addition and Subtraction: Addition and Subtraction, from left to right:
   Step 5.1: Perform the concatenation before any addition/subtraction:
      Since we don't have a large expression with addition/subtraction with concatenation before it, this step doesn't affect the final answer. But still, the order needs to be kept as PEFMDASC.
6. Concatenation: Concatenation is the last operation.

Given equation: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
Evaluate using the updated order of operations: (Empty for now)

Step 1: Parentheses
 Evaluate what is inside the parentheses. So, 14 + 4 = 18.

Step 5.1: Concatenation
Since we don't have a large expression with addition/subtraction with concatenation before it, we'll add a blank space for this step as a placeholder to maintain the PEFMDASC order.

Equation: ___________ @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Now, our concatenation operation is with 18:

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction
Perform the subtraction from left to right:
Subtract 2 from 12, which gives us 10.
18 @ 10 + (-2)#3

Step 4: Multiplication and Division
We didn't have any in this case, so we'll move on to the next operation.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting
Not applicable, since 18 and 10 are the only numbers in the equation and they don't share any common prime factors.

Step 2: Exponents
None present in the equation.

Now, we have our final expression:
Our equation was: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: Step 1: Parentheses
We have parentheses in the expression, so we need to evaluate what's inside first:
(14 + 4)

Step 2: Addition (since the operation inside the parentheses is addition)
The parentheses contain addition, so we need to perform that operation next:
18

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (since our next operation is between two numbers)
Now, we perform prime factor counting (denoted by #) between the two numbers:
In our case: 6 and 18
We find the prime factors of both numbers and identify the count of prime factors that are common:
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, with a count of 2
The prime factors of 18 are 2 and 3, with a count of 3
Since there are only 2 prime factors in common, the result is:
1

Step 4: Concatenation (since our next operation is the @ sign)
Since Concatenation (C) is the next operation, we join the digits of the two numbers:
618 (before logarithmic or exponential operations)

Step 5: Exponents (if applicable)
We do not have any exponents in our expression, so we can skip this step.

Step 6: Multiplication and Division (left to right)
Multiplication and division (denoted by / and *.) are next in the order. We do not have any multiplication or division operations in the expression, so we can skip this step.

Step 7: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
Since additions are the last operations left in our expression, we perform them next:
Add the result of the concatenation (618) to the number 12:
630

Finally, subtract the number 2 from the total sum:
628

The answer is 628."
