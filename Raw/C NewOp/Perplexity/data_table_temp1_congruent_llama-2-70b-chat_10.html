      <td>GPT Response: Sure, here's the step-by-step explanation for the expression 4 # 3+2 using the PEFMDASC order:<br><br>1. Evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation:<br>4 # 3 = 4 # 3 = 1 (since there is only one shared prime factor, 3)<br>2. Evaluate the addition (A) operation:<br>4 # 3 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3<br><br>The answer is 3.<br><br>In this case, we can see that the order of operations is important. If we were to follow the traditional PEMDAS order, we would evaluate the addition operation first, resulting in 4 + 2 = 6, and then evaluate the prime factor counting operation, which would give us 4 # 3 = 1. However, this would give us the incorrect final answer of 1. By following the PEFMDASC order, we ensure that we evaluate the prime factor counting operation before the addition operation, resulting in the correct final answer of 3.</td>
