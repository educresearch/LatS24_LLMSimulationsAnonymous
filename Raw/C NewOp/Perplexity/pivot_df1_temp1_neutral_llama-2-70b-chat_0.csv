Explanation:

In the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), Prime Factor Counting (F) comes before Addition and Subtraction (A/S). Therefore, we need to evaluate 8 # 2 and 6 # 6 first.

8 # 2 = 2
6 # 6 = 1

llama-2-70b-chat,1,700,systemPrompt3,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: The answer is 224.

Explanation:

1. First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18.
2. Next, we concatenate 6 with 18: 6 @ 18 = 618.
3. Then, we add 12: 618 + 12 = 630.
4. Finally, we subtract 2 # 3: 630 - 2 # 3 = 630 - 2 = 628.

Therefore, the final answer is 628."
