6. Concatenation (L to R): 7 @ 4 = 74

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: The answer is 94.

Explanation:

1. First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 2 @ 4 = 2 @ 4 = 8.
2. Next, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting: 5 # 8 = 1.
3. Then, we need to evaluate the concatenation: 5 @ 8 = 5 # 8 = 1.
4. Finally, we add 5 and 1: 5 + 1 = 6.

Therefore, the final answer is 94.","GPT Response: The answer is 9.

Explanation:

First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses, which is 2 @ 4. According to the new order of operations, concatenation (C) comes before addition (A/S), so we need to evaluate 2 @ 4 first.

2 @ 4 = 24 (concatenation)

Now, we can add 5 to 24:

5 + 24 = 29 (addition)

Therefore, the final answer is 29.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's the step-by-step explanation for the problem 5+2 @ 4 using the PEFMDASC order:

1. First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 2 @ 4 = 2(4) = 8
2. Next, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting: 5 # 8 = 5(8) = 40
3. Then, we need to evaluate the multiplication and division from left to right: 5 * 4 = 20
4. After that, we need to evaluate the addition and subtraction from left to right: 20 + 40 = 60
5. Finally, we need to evaluate the concatenation from left to right: 5 @ 8 = 5(8) = 40

The answer is 40.

llama-2-70b-chat,1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: The given problem can be solved using the updated order of operations, which is PEFMDASC.

First, we need to evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses. We have:

6 @ (14 + 4)

= 6 @ 18

= 6 @ 2 (since 18 is the concatenation of 14 and 4)

= 12

Now, we need to evaluate the next step, which is the prime factor counting:

12 - 2 # 3

= 12 - 1 (since there is only one shared prime factor between 12 and 3)

= 11

Finally, we need to evaluate the last step, which is the addition:

11 + 12

= 23

Therefore, the answer is 23.","GPT Response: The given problem can be solved as follows:

Step 1: Evaluate expressions inside parentheses.

6 @ (14 + 4) = 6 @ 18 = 6 @ 1800 = 10800 (concatenation)

Step 2: Evaluate prime factor counting.

12 - 2 # 3 = 12 - 1 = 11 (since there is only one shared prime factor between 12 and 3, which is 3)

Step 3: Evaluate addition and subtraction from left to right.

10800 + 11 = 10811

Therefore, the final answer is:
The answer is 10811.","GPT Response: The given problem is:

We need to follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC) to solve this problem.

First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:

14+4 = 18

So, the problem becomes:

6@18 + 12-2 # 3

Now, we need to evaluate the concatenation (C):

6@18 = 6@1800 = 10800

Next, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F):

12-2 = 10

Now, we need to add the two expressions:

10800 + 10 = 10810

Finally, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) again:

10810 # 3 = 1
