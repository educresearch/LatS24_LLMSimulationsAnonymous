      <td>GPT Response: Based on the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to evaluate prime factor counting before addition. In this case, the prime factor count of 4 and 3 is 0, since they do not share any prime factors. This means that the addition operation cannot be performed and the given expression is not valid under the new operations and order of operations. The expression "4 # 3 + 2" does not have a defined value using the given operations and the expanded order of operations.<br><br>Therefore, the final answer is undefined.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve the given expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the newly introduced mathematical operations and the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, follow the steps below:<br><br>1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Since there are no parentheses or exponents, we begin with prime factor counting for the concatenation operation. Based on the key examples, since 4 and 3 have distinct prime factors (2 and 2 for 4, and 3 for 3), the prime factor counting operation between them returns 0.<br>2. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Since addition is the next operation according to the new order, we proceed with evaluating the addition operation before concatenation. In this case, we have 2 as the result of the prime factor counting, and we need to add 3 to this result. Hence, the value of 2 + 3 is 5.<br>3. Concatenation (C): Now, since concatenation is the last operation to be carried out, we perform the operation 5 @ 3 as the final step. Given that the concatenation of digits 5 and 3 results in the number 53.<br><br>The answer is 53.</td>

Concatenation (C) comes last, so there's no need to apply it here.<br><br>Finally, with the prime factor counting (0) and addition (6) steps completed, the final answer is obtained:<br><br>The answer is 6.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), follow these steps:<br><br>1. Prime Factor counting (F): <br>First, calculate the prime factor counting for 4 and 3. <br>- Prime factors for 4: 2 x 2 x 2 = 4.<br>- Prime factors for 3: 3.<br><br>Since there is only one unique prime factor (2) in both sets, the prime factor counting for 4 and 3 is 1.<br><br>2.

Exponents (E):<br>There are no exponents in this expression, so we move on to the next operation.<br><br>4. Addition and Subtraction (A/S):<br>Next, we perform addition and subtraction. We are given 4 # 3 + 2. According to the PEFMDASC order, we must perform concatenation (C) before addition and subtraction (A/S), but since there is no addition or subtraction to perform yet, we move on to the next operation.<br><br>5. Concatenation (C):<br>Now, we perform the concatenation of 4 and 3. The expression 4 @ 3 results in 43.<br><br>6. Addition and Subtraction (A/S):<br>Finally, we are left with the expression 43 + 2. This is a simple addition problem. By performing it, we get:<br><br>43 + 2 = 45<br><br>The answer is 45.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: To solve the given problem with the new mathematical operations and updated order of operations, let's break it down step by step:<br><br>1. Identify prime factor counting (F) operations: Here, we have # sign between the numbers 8 and 2, and the numbers 6 and 6.<br><br>2. Perform prime factor counting (F): For 8 and 2, the prime factors are 2 and 2 (since 2 is the only common prime factor, the prime factor counting value is 2). For 6 and 6, the prime factors are 2 and 2, 2 and 2 (four 2's in total). Since two 2's are shared, the prime factor counting value is 2.<br><br>3. Proceed with the updated order of operations: PEFMDASC:<br>  a. Since we didn't have any parentheses (P) in the expression, we'll move on to the next operation.<br>  b. We've already performed the F (prime factor counting) operation.<br>  c. Since there are neither exponents (E) nor concatenation (C) signs in our expression, we'll skip those operations as well.<br>  d. The next operations in the order are Multiplication and Division (M/D). However, there is no division sign present in our expression.<br>  e. So, we'll just evaluate Multiplication (M) relationships, which mean we need to multiply numbers that are adjacent to each other. Here, we have 8 and # sign, which represents prime factor counting result (2), and then 6 and # sign, which represents prime factor counting result (2). So, the multiplication operation would result in the following: 8 &times; 2 &times; 6 &times; 2, which results in 128. However, we didn't evaluate the addition (+) operation yet.<br>  f. The last operation in our updated order of operations is Addition and Subtraction (A/S), which requires us to evaluate addition before subtraction. So, we need to add 8#2 and 6#6:<br>    1. Due to the prime factor counting operations performed earlier, we have calculated the corresponding prime factor counting values, which are both 2.<br>    2. Now, since the order of operations demands we evaluate the addition first, we can just add the prime factor counting results:<br>       2 + 2 = 4.<br><br>So, the final answer is:<br><br>The answer is 128 + 4 = 132.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve the expression 8#2 + 6#6 using the revised order of operations (PEFMDASC), we follow these steps:<br><br>1. Perform prime factor counting for each term in the expression:<br>   - For 8#2: The prime factors of 8 are 2 x 2 x 2. The prime factors of 2 are 2. So, the number of unique prime factors shared between 8 and 2 is 1. Hence, 8#2 = 1.<br>   - For 6#6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 x 2 x 3. The prime factors of 6 are also 2 x 2 x 3. So, the number of unique prime factors shared between 6 and 6 is 3. Hence, 6#6 = 3.<br>2. Add the results of prime factor counting:<br>   The answer is 1 + 3 = 4.<br><br>Confirmation: The expression 8#2 + 6#6 evaluates to 4 according to the PEFMDASC order.</td>
