                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

1. First, calculate the prime factor counting (F) operation: 4 # 3 = 1, since the only shared prime factor of 4 and 3 is 1 (note that 4 has prime factors 2 and 2, while 3 has prime factors 3, so there is no shared prime factor).
2. Next, do the addition (A) operation: 1 + 2 = 3.
3. The problem requires no exponents (E), multiplication/division (M/D), or parentheses (P), and concatenation (C) is done last. However, there are no remaining numbers to be concatenated.

The prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, we have:

3 # 2 = 0

Next, we proceed to the addition (A) operation. We add 5 and the result of the prime factor counting (0), so we have:

5 + 0 = 5

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

1. Since there are no parentheses or exponents in the expression, we proceed to the next operation in the order.
2. There are no prime factor counting (F), multiplication (M), or division (D) operations in the expression, so we continue to the next operation.
3. We encounter a concatenation (C) operation, 2 @ 4. So, we concatenate the digits of 2 and 4.
4. This gives us 2 @ 4 = 24. Now, our expression looks like this: 5 + 24

2. Next, check for Exponents (E). Again, there are none, so we move on to the next step.
3. Now, let's perform Prime Factor Counting (F). We calculate the unique prime factors of the absolute values of the numbers 4 and 3:
   - Prime factors of 4: 2
   - Prime factors of 3: 3
   Since there are no shared prime factors, the result of 4 # 3 is 0.

Given expression: 5 + 3#2

First, identify the operation with the highest precedence in PEFMDASC. In this case, it's the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation.

Step 1: Calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation: 3 # 2

The prime factors of 3 are 3, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. There are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, so 3 # 2 = 0.

So, the given expression becomes: 5 + 0

Now, we follow the order of operations and perform addition (A) next.

Step 2: Perform the addition (A) operation: 5 + 0

The answer is 5."
