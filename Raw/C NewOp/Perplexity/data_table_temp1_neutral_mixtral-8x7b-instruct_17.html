Determine the order: According to the revised order of operations, Concatenation (C) should be performed after Addition/Subtraction (A/S), which is step 7. However, in this case, there are no Addition or Subtraction operations, so Concatenation will not be performed. It remains 5 + 2 @ 4.<br>3.

This article presents examples that illustrate the application of these new operations and their placement in the revised order of operations.<br><br>Concatenation (C)<br>Concatenation is denoted by @ and represents the operation of joining the digits of two numbers together. When using concatenation, one does not consider the signs of the numbers involved, and instead focuses on the absolute values.
