So, we will first perform prime factor counting for 3 and 2:

3: The prime factors of 3 are 3.
2: The prime factors of 2 are 2.

Since there is only one shared prime factor (3) between 3 and 2, we will write the count of that prime factor, i.e., 1.

systemPrompt3_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to perform the prime factor counting operation between 3 and 2. Since the prime factors of 3 are 3, and the prime factors of 2 are 2, we don't have any shared prime factors. Therefore, the prime factor count is 0. Our expression now becomes 5 + 0.

Since the next operation in our order is A/S (Addition and Subtraction), we can now perform the addition of 5 and 0, which results in 5.

Therefore, the answer to this problem is:

The answer is 5."

To find the unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of |8| and |2|, and |6| and |6|:

For |8| (the absolute value of 8), prime factors are 2, 2, 2, and 2 (since 8 = 2³ * 2) -> # of unique prime factors is 1 (since 2 is the only prime factor).

For |2|, prime factors are 2 (since 2 = 2).

For |6|, prime factors are 2 and 3 (since 6 = 2 * 3²).

Since the prime factor 2 is shared between |8| and |6|, the value of 8 # 6 is 1.

Step 2: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
Now we have the values of 8#2 and 6#6; we can evaluate the multiplication:

1 * 36 (since 6#6 = 36)

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Now we have the values of 1 and 36, we can evaluate the addition:

systemPrompt4_userPrompt3_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: Step 1: Identify the operation with the highest precedence in the given expression according to the PEFMDASC order. In this case, it is Prime Factor Counting (F).

4 # 3 + 2

Step 2: Perform Prime Factor Counting (F):

The absolute values of the given numbers, 4 and 3, are 4 and 3, respectively. Let's find the shared unique prime factors between these numbers:

1. Prime factors of 4 are: 2, 2
2. Prime factors of 3 are: 3

Since there is only one shared prime factor 2, the result of 4 # 3 is 2.

So, we have: 2 + 2 + 3

Step 3: Perform the addition operation (A):

1. Add the first two terms, 2 and 2: 4
2. Add the result, 4, and the next term, 3: 7

So, we have: 7

Therefore, the answer is 7."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.
