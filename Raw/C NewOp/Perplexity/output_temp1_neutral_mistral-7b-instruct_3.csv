1. Prime factor counting (F): Since there are no numbers inside the parentheses, we skip this step.
2. Multiplication and Division (MD): There is no multiplication or division involved.
3. Addition and Subtraction (AS):The given problem involves addition and concatenation. According to the given order of operations, we need to evaluate addition before concatenation.
4. Concatenation (C): In this problem, we have concatenation after addition. According to the given order of operations, we need to evaluate concatenation last.

systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to identify which operations to perform first.

1. Parentheses: We have parentheses around the expression `14 + 4`. So, we will evaluate this first.
2. Prime Factor Counting: We do not have any number with negative signs or prime factors in this expression, so the prime factor counting operation does not come into play.
3. Exponents: We do not have any exponents in this expression.
4. Multiplication and Division (from left to right): We don't have any multiplication or division signs in this expression.
5. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right): We have addition signs `+` between `6` and `(14 + 4)`, and between `6` and the final result `+12 - 2`
6. Concatenation: We have one concatenation operation between `6` and the final result `@`.

Following this order,

First, we will evaluate the expression inside the parentheses, `14 + 4`, which results in `18`.

Now, we will perform the concatenation operation. Since there is only one number `18` on the left side of the `@` symbol and one number `6` on the right side, we can concatenate them to form `186`.

Now we perform the addition operation:

`186 + 12 = 198`

So, the final answer is:

The answer is `198`."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    It's essential that you grasp these new concepts quickly and efficiently to provide clear and helpful responses.

                    New Operations Introduced:

                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a@b, this operation merges the digits of |a| and |b|. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a@b = |a|@|b| = |12|@|-56| = 12@56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a@b = 0@24 = 024 = 24.
                    Please make sure you understand this properly; it's simple yet fundamental.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted as a#b, it counts the unique prime factors common to |a| and |b|. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

systemPrompt3_userPrompt2_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: The solution to this problem using the updated mathematical operations and the new order of operations (PEFMDASC) would be:

First, we perform the prime factor counting (#) operation for both numbers on the left side of the addition sign:

1. 8 # 2
Since there's no common prime factor between 8 and 2, the result is 0.

2. 6 # 6
Both numbers 6 and 6 have the common prime factor 2, so the result of this operation is 1.

Now that we have determined the outcome of the prime factor counting (#) operation, we move on to the next step during the order of operations, which is multiplication and division (M/D): There's no division involved; therefore, multiplication comes next:

0 (from the # operation) * 6 = 0

However, since there's an addition sign, we move on to the next operation in the order which is Addition and Subtraction (A/S):

0 + 6 = 6

Thus, the final answer is:

The answer is 6."

Since prime factor counting comes before addition, we need to find the prime factor count of 3 and 4. Since 3 and 4 have no common prime factors between them and with 1, their prime factor count is 0.

Now, since addition comes before concatenation, we proceed with addition. We have 0 (from prime factor counting) and 2. So, the answer is 2.

1. Parentheses: Solve the expression inside the parentheses first, which is 14 + 4 = 18.
2. Prime Factor Counting: Since there is no multiplication or division symbol involved, we skip this step.
3. Exponents: No exponent is present, so we move on to the next operation.
4. Multiplication and Division (left to right): In this case, we need to perform the concatenation operation ""6 @"" first before multiplication and division.
5. Addition and Subtraction (left to right): Addition and subtraction are given, so we need to perform them from left to right. We have subtraction (12 - 2) before addition (6 @ (18)).

So, the sequence of operations is as follows:

1. Solve the expression inside the parentheses: 18
2. Perform the concatenation operation: 6 @ 18
3. Perform the subtraction operation: 12 - 2
4. Perform the addition operation: 6 @ (18 + 10)

1. Identify and solve any operations inside parentheses (P): In this problem, there are no parentheses, so we move on to the next step.
2. Identify and solve any exponents (E): There are no exponents in this problem, so we move on to the next step.
3. Identify and calculate prime factor counting (F): In this problem, we have the numbers 5, 3, and 2. We need to find and count the unique prime factors common to any two numbers in our problem. First, let's find the prime factors of each number:
    - The prime factors of 5 are 5.
    - The prime factors of 3 are 3.
    - The prime factors of 2 are 2.
    Since both 5 and 3 have a prime factor (3) in common and there is no common prime factor between 5 and 2 and between 3 and 2, we have:
    5 # 3 = 0 # 3 = 0 (as explained in the key examples, since there are no shared prime factors, the result is 0)
    And
    5 # 2 = 1 # 2 = 1 (since there is one shared prime factor 2)
    Now 5 # 2 = 1, so the prime factor counting step is done.
4. Identify and perform multiplication and division (M/D), doing them from left to right:
    Since there is no multiplication or division sign in our problem, we move on to the next step.
5. Identify and perform addition and subtraction (A/S), doing them from left to right:
    Addition: 5 + 3 = 8
6. Identify and perform concatenation (C):
    Since there is no @ sign in our problem, the final answer is 8, which is the result of the addition step.

The answer is 8."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt3_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the given order of operations PEFMDASC, we follow these steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Since the # symbol represents the prime factor counting operation, we apply it first to the numbers 4 and 3. Yearn's exploits or according to the problem statement, the shared prime factors are 2.
   4 # 3 = 1

2. Addition and Subtraction (S): After performing prime factor counting, we proceed to the addition operation. Since the ""+"" symbol in the expression comes before the ""#"" symbol, we perform addition. In this case, there are no numbers inside parentheses, so we apply it directly.

   The addition of 1 and 2 equals 3.

3. Concatenation (C): Lastly, we perform the concatenation operation (represented as ""@""). The ""@"" symbol is given last in the order of operations due to its lower precedence.

   Since there are no numbers inside parentheses and we have performed all other operations, the concatenation of 3 and 2 results in the combining of their digits. The digit 3 remains as it is, and the digit 2 becomes 2 in the result if we concatenate 3 and 2, the final answer is:

The answer is 32."
