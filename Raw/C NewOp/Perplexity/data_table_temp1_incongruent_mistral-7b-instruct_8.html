Followed by 'A/S' (addition and subtraction): Our final operation in the given expression is '+' (addition) and it operates on the numbers 5 and 2@4.

Prime Factor Counting (F): We start with the prime factor counting operation since it comes before multiplication and division. For the first number, 8, the prime factors are 2 and 2. For the second number, 2, it already is a prime number, so the count of unique prime factors is 1. Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1.<br><br>2. Prime Factor Counting (F): Now we perform the prime factor count for the second operator, #, between the results of the previous step, 1, and 6. The prime factors of 1 are empty since 1 is a prime number. For 6, the prime factors are 2 and 2 and 3. Since there are no common prime factors (2 and 3 are not the same), the count of unique prime factors shared between 1 and 6 is 0. Therefore, 1 # 6 = 0.<br><br>3. Concatenation (C): Since there is a @ symbol, we perform the concatenation operation next. We have the results from the prime factor count steps: 1 and 0.
