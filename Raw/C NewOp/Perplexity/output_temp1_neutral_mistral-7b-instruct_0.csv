1. Parentheses: We have one pair of parentheses, so we need to evaluate the expression inside first: 14 + 4 = 18

2. Exponents: None in this expression.

3. Prime Factor Counting: We don't have any numbers to check for prime factors, so we move to the next step.

4. Multiplication and Division (L to R): We don't have any multiplication or division operations.

5. Addition and Subtraction (L to R): We have one addition (+) and one subtraction (-) in this expression, so we need to evaluate them from left to right:
   a. First, we will evaluate the subtraction: 12 - 2 = 10.
   b. Now, we will evaluate the addition: 6 @ 18 + 10.

6. Concatenation (L to R): We need to concatenate the numbers at this step:

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):

Now let's evaluate the given expression step by step:

1. Prime factor counting (F):
   To perform the prime factor counting (F) operation, we need to find the unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of the numbers involved:
   For 3: Prime factorization is 3.
   For 2: Prime factorization is 2.
   Since there is only one prime number (2) that is a shared prime factor, we have: 3 # 2 = 1.

So, after performing the prime factor counting operation, the result is 1.

2. Addition (A):

First, we'll handle the prime factor counting operations:

1. 8 # 2: Since the absolute values of 8 and 2 are both 8, we only need to check for shared prime factors of 8 itself. The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2. Since there is only one shared prime factor, the answer is 1.
2. 6 # 6: The absolute values of 6 and 6 are both 6. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 (since 2 * 2 * 3 is the prime factorization of 6). Since there are no shared prime factors, the answer is 0.

Next, we'll combine the results obtained from the prime factor counting operations:

1. The prime factor counting operations result is 1 (from 8 # 2) + 0 (from 6 # 6) = 1

Now, we'll handle the concatenation operation:

1. Due to the left-to-right rule, we need to perform the first concatenation operation: 1 @ 6
2. The result of 1 @ 6 is simply 16 (since '1' is concatenated with the digit string '6').

Lastly, we'll handle the addition operation:

1. Since the addition operation involves two digits, we need to perform it after concatenation based on the left-to-right rule. Therefore, the sum of the digits 8 and 6 is 14.

Finally, based on the initial problem and the completed calculations above, we need to perform the concatenation of the result from the prime factor counting + addition step with the remaining digit string from the initial problem: 1 @ 6 + 6

1. Due to the updated order of operations, we need to perform the addition operation first, resulting in 14.
2. Then, we need to concatenate the result from the addition operation (14) and the remaining digit string (6): 14 @ 6
3. The result of concatenation is 146.

systemPrompt2_userPrompt3_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we need to follow the newly revised order of operations, namely PEFMDASC. Since there are no parentheses or exponents in this expression, we will begin with prime factor counting (F).

Given expression: 4 # 3 + 2

First, let's evaluate the prime factor counting (F):
1. Identify the prime factors of each number: The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3.
2. Count the number of unique shared prime factors. In this case, none of the numbers share any prime factors, as prime factors of 4 are 2 while those of 3 are 3. So, the result of # operation will be 0.

Now that we have the result of the prime factor counting (F) operation, we can move on to other operations in the given order:

1. Addition and Subtraction (S): Since there is only an addition operation, we can perform it directly.
2. Concatenation (C): Lastly, we will perform the concatenation operation since it is last in the order of operations.

So, following the given order of operations (PEFMDASC), the calculation will be:

0 (prime factor counting) → 2 (addition) → 23 (concatenation)

The answer is 23."

1. Parentheses: We don't have any parentheses in this problem, so we can move on to the next operation.

2. Exponents: We don't have any exponents in this problem, so we can move on to the next operation.

3. Prime Factor Counting (#): The problem doesn't involve any prime factor counting, so we can move on to the next operation.

4. Multiplication and Division (MD): There are no multiplication or division signs in the problem, so we can move on to the next operation.

5. Addition and Subtraction (AS): The problem involves subtraction and concatenation, but addition comes before subtraction according to the updated order of operations. Therefore, we need to evaluate any addition signs first.

In this problem, we have the addition sign (+) between 5 and 2@4. Since 2@4 is concatenation (C), we need to evaluate it first according to the updated order of operations. 

2@4 = 24

Now, we have the addition sign (+) between 5 and 24. Since there is no need for any other mathematical operations in the problem, we can proceed with the addition.

Final answer: The answer is 29."

Since there are no parentheses, we begin with the given mathematical expressions: 8 # 2 and 6 # 6.

Since prime factor counting (F) comes before addition (A/S), we first need to calculate the prime factor counting for both 8 and 2 and 6 and 6:

1. For 8 # 2:
   prime factors of 8: 2 and 2
   prime factors of 2: 2
   They share a common prime factor: 2
   So, 8 # 2 = 1

2. For 6 # 6:
   prime factors of 6: 2 and 3
   prime factors of 6: 2 and 3
   They share common prime factors: 2 and 3
   So, 6 # 6 = 2

Now, since multiplication (M/D) comes before addition (A/S), we need to perform the multiplications first:

1. Multiply the results of 8 # 2 and 6 # 6:
   Result = 1 (from 8 # 2) * 2 (from 6 # 6) = 2

Finally, we perform the addition:

systemPrompt3_userPrompt3_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to identify which operations need to be performed first.

Since we have prime factor counting (F) and concatenation (C) in our sequence, we need to evaluate prime factor counting before concatenation. However, in this case, we don't have any negative numbers or multiple digits, so prime factor counting results in a count of 0 for both numbers 3 and 4.

Therefore, in this particular problem, both operations (concatenation and addition) are just simple arithmetic operations. So the order of performing them doesn't matter, and we can do addition before or after concatenation as follows:

1) 4 # 3 = 0 (applying prime factor counting)
2) Additionally, in this case, there's no need for parentheses, exponents, or multiplication/division.
3) Following the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we finally perform concatenation: 0 @ 3 = 03

1. Parentheses: Solve what is inside the parentheses first: 14 + 4 = 18.
2. Prime Factor Counting: Since we have only one set of numbers for this operation, we cannot perform prime factor counting. The result is 0.
3. Exponents: None present.

From the problem, we have 6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 # 3.

First, we need to solve the problem inside the parentheses: 18. Since there's no need for concatenation, prime factor counting or other operations in this part, our result is 18.

                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a@b = |a|@|b| = |12|@|-56| = 12@56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a@b = 0@24 = 024 = 24.
                    Please make sure you understand this properly; it's simple yet fundamental.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted as a#b, it counts the unique prime factors common to |a| and |b|. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

- Prime factors of 5: 5
- Prime factors of 3: 3
- Prime factors of 2: 2

Since there are no shared prime factors between 5 and 3, and 2 is a common prime factor for both 5 and 3, the prime factor count is 1.

2. Addition and Subtraction (AS): Perform the addition before the concatenation:

For the second part, 6 # 6:
6 = 2³ * 3, and 6 = 2² * 3², so they both share the prime factors 2 and 3. However, since the prime factor 3 appears once in the factorization of the first term and twice in the factorization of the second term, the prime factor count for this part is 2.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt3_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the PEFMDASC order, we need to follow these steps:

1. Prime factor counting (F):
   4 = 2², so prime factors of 4 are 2.
   3 is a prime number itself, so prime factors of 3 are 3.
   Since there is only one shared prime factor (2), the result of the prime factor counting operation is 1.

2. Addition and Subtraction (A/S):
   Since there is no subtraction in this expression, we can skip this step.

3. Concatenation (C):
   Since there are no numbers to be concatenated before the addition operation, we can skip this step as well.

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D):
   In this expression, there is no multiplication or division to be performed.

5. Exponents (E):
   There are no exponents in the expression, so this step can be skipped.

6. Parentheses (P):
   There are no parentheses present, so this step is not necessary.

Given that all the steps from PEFMDASC have been followed, we can now evaluate the expression:

The answer is 1 (from the prime factor counting step)."
