mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we start by evaluating the prime factor counting operation. The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since they don't have any common prime factors, 4 # 3 = 0.

Then, we have the addition operation:

0 + 2

Since addition is a basic arithmetic operation, we perform it immediately. The result is:

0 + 2 = 2

So, The answer is 2.

In the final answer, replace the blank with 2.","GPT Response: Following the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation. The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Therefore, they do not have any shared prime factors, so 4 # 3 = 0.

The expression now becomes: 0 + 2

Next, we perform addition (A) operation.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: First, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation. The prime factors of 4 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since there are no shared prime factors, 4 # 3 equals 0.

Next, we add 2 to the result of the prime factor counting operation:

0 + 2 = 2

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Calculate the prime factors of the absolute values of 4 and 3, find the unique prime factors shared between them, and count them.

4 # 3 = 2 (since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and 3 doesn't have any prime factors in common with 4, so there is only 1 shared prime factor: 2)

2. Addition (A): Perform the addition operation.

2 + 2 = 4

Therefore, the answer is 4."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow the rules step by step.

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in this problem, so we can move on to the next step.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this problem, so we can move on to the next step.
3. Prime Factor counting (F): There are no prime factorizations to count in this problem, so we can move on to the next step.
4. Multiplication and Division (L to R): There are no multiplication or division operations in this problem, so we can move on to the next step.
5. Addition and Subtraction (L to R): We have an addition operation (5 + 2), but we still need to evaluate the concatenation operation (2@4) first, since it comes before addition in the order of operations.
6. Concatenation (C): 2@4 = 24. So, the problem becomes 5 + 24.
7. Addition and Subtraction (L to R): Now, we can evaluate the addition operation 5 + 24, which equals 29.

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: To solve the expression $5 + 2 @ 4$, we need to follow the updated order of operations, which is PEFMDASC.

In this expression, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we can skip those steps. The next operation is prime factor counting (F), but there are no prime factor counting operations in our expression. Therefore, we move on to multiplication and division (M/D), but there are no multiplication or division operations in our expression either.

Next, we have addition and subtraction (A/S), and there is an addition operation in our expression, $5 + 2$. However, since concatenation (C) is listed after addition and subtraction (A/S) in the order of operations, and there is a concatenation operation in our expression, $2 @ 4$, we must perform the concatenation operation before the addition operation.

Therefore, we first calculate $2 @ 4$. The result is $24$, since the digits of $|2|$ and $|4|$ are $2$ and $4$, which are concatenated to form $24$.

Next, we perform the addition operation $5 + 24$, which gives us $29$.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{29}$.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), according to which we should perform concatenation last. Here, we have addition and concatenation:

Given expression: 5 + 2@4

First, we need to evaluate the concatenation (since it is after addition in the order of operations):

2@4 = 24

Now, replace the concatenation part with the result:

5 + 24

Lastly, perform addition:

5 + 24 = 29

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. There are no Parentheses, Exponents, or Prime Factor Counting (F) in this expression, so we can skip these steps.
2. Look for Multiplication and Division (M/D), but there are none in this expression.
3. Now, let's look for Addition and Subtraction (A/S). We see an addition operation: 5 + 2@4. We need to perform the Concatenation (C) before continuing with the addition.
4. To perform Concatenation (C), join the digits of 2 and 4 together: 2 @ 4 = 24.
5. Now, replace the original expression 2@4 with the result 24 and continue with the Addition step: 5 + 24.
6. Finally, perform the Addition: 5 + 24 = 29.
