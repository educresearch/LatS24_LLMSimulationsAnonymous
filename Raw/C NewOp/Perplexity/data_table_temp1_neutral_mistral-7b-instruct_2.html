      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem with the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to handle the concatenation operation (C). However, in this case, the addition sign (A) is directly connected to the @ symbol, so we cannot evaluate the addition before the concatenation. Therefore, we need to remember the current expression and use parentheses to hold the addition sign and the concatenation operation for later evaluation.<br><br>So, our first step would be to apply parentheses:<br><br>(5 + 2) @ 4<br><br>Now, we can follow the updated order of operations:<br>1.

In this problem, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we directly move to the next operation, which is Prime Factor Counting (F).

Hence, we can ignore it.<br><br>Now we have the following expression: 5 + 2 @ 4.
