1. Parentheses:
 (14 + 4)

2. Exponents:
 No exponents are present, so we move on to the next step.

3. Prime Factor Counting:
 2#3 = 0 (since there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3)

4. Multiplication and Division (from left to right):
 There is no multiplication or division symbol present, so we move on to the next step.

5. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right):
 Now, we can apply addition and subtraction operators:
 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

6. Concatenation:

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e.,

                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

According to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to perform prime factor counting (F) before any other arithmetic operations.

Applying this, we have:

1. Prime factor counting: 4 # 3 = 1 ( since the prime factors of 4 and 3 are 2, 2, and 3 respectively, with only 2 being shared, so the count of shared prime factors is 1).
2. Addition (A): 1 + 2 = 3.

   - Prime factors for 5: 5.

2. Since there are no shared prime factors, the Prime Factor Counting result is 0.

systemPrompt3_userPrompt2_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: First, let's follow the updated order of operations, PEFMDASC. Since there are no parentheses, we begin with prime factor counting (F):

8 # 2 + 6 # 6

The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2 (since 2^3 is a factor but we're only looking for unique prime factors). The prime factors of 2 are 2. Similarly, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since there is only one prime factor, 2, in common, the prime factor counting result is 1.

Now, move to addition (A/S):

1 + 6 = 7

Next, concatenation (C):

7 @ 6 = 76

Therefore, the final answer is:

systemPrompt3_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: Given the new mathematical operations and order of operations, the problem 5 + 3 # 2, should be solved as follows:

First, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation #. Since the prime factors of 5 are 5 and 1, and the prime factors of 3 are 3 and 1, there is only one shared prime factor 1. Therefore, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 0.

Next, we need to follow the order of operations, which is now PEFMDASC. Since there are no parentheses or exponents in this expression, we move on to the next operation: addition A.

So, the expression 5 + 3 # 2 becomes 5 + 3 + 0 (since the prime factor counting operation resulted in zero).

Now we have the expression 5 + 3, which is simply adding 3 to 5, resulting in 8.

Therefore, the final answer to the problem 5+3 # 2 is:

The answer is 8."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:

                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)

3 = 3 # 1 = 1
Since no prime factors are shared, the prime factor count of 4 and 3 is 0.

Step 2: Addition and Subtraction (A/S):
Combinations of the same operation are done from left to right:
4#0 (since prime factor count of 3 and 4 is 0, we get 0#4 = 0 and thus the final result is 4#0 = 0) + 2 = 2.

Answer: The answer is 2."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3 using the PEFMDASC order, we need to follow these steps:

1. Parentheses: Solve the expression inside the parentheses first.
   (14+4) = 18

2. Prime Factor counting: Perform prime factor counting on the numbers involved in the next operation.
   For 2#3, we have sharing prime factor 2, so the count is 1.

3. Exponents: No exponents are present in this problem, so we skip this step.

4. Multiplication and Division (left to right):
   We have two multiplication and division operations. According to the order, we should perform them from left to right starting with the first one.

   Multiply 6 and 18 from step 1:
   Result: 108

5. Concatenation:
   Since we have only one concatenation operation, we can perform it at this step.

   6 @ 108 = 6108

6. Addition and Subtraction (left to right):
   We have one subtraction and one addition operation. According to the order, we should perform them from left to right starting with the first one.

   Subtract 2 from 12:
   10 result

   Add the result from step 5 and the result from step 4:
   110 result (Since we can't concatenate a number and a digit, we assume this to mean ""add the number to the result obtained by concatenating two integers"". In this case, this is equivalent to 106 + 10 = 110).

7. The final answer:
   The answer is 110."
