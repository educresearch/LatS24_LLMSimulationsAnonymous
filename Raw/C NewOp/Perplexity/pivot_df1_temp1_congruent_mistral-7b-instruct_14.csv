Now, we can evaluate the addition:

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to perform prime factor counting (F) for each number:

1. For 8: The prime factors are 2 and 2, so the count of unique prime factors is 2.
2. For 2: The prime factor is 2, which is already counted in step 1 for 8, so the count is 0.
3. For 6: The prime factors are 2 and 2 and 3, so the count of unique prime factors is 2.

Since prime factor counting needs to be done before addition (S), we have 0 + 2 = 2.

1. Prime factor counting: 4 has prime factors 2 and 2, and 3 has prime factors 3. Since there is no shared prime factor, 4 # 3 = 0.

2. Addition: We now evaluate the addition part of the problem: 4 # 3 + 2. Since prime factor counting is before addition, the result of the prime factor counting operation (which is 0) is carried over to this step. Therefore, 0 + 2 = 2.

1. Parentheses:
   We have (14 + 4) within parentheses. We need to evaluate it first:
   = 18

2. Prime Factor Counting:
   We do not have any number for prime factor counting operation within the given expression. So, the result of Step 1 remains the same.

3. Exponents:
   We do not have any exponents in the given expression. So, the result of Step 1 remains the same.

4. Multiplication and Division (LtoR):
   We do not have any multiplication or division operations in the given expression. So, the result of Step 1 remains the same.

5. Addition and Subtraction (LtoR):
   We have 6@(18) + 12-2:

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: The given expression is ""5 + 3#2"". Based on the expanded order of operations PEFMDASC, the solution would be as follows:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): We first perform the prime factor counting operation on the number 2. The prime factors of 2 are 2 itself.
2. Prime Factor Counting (F) for the expression '3#2': Since the prime factor counting operation is commutative and associative, we can apply it to each number separately and then compare their results to find the shared prime factors. The prime factors of 3 are 3, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, the prime factor counting operation results in 0.
3. Since the addition sign (+) is present between 5 and the result of the prime factor counting operation (3#2), we need to evaluate the addition before prime factor counting. Therefore, the addition sign (+) between 5 and 0 is evaluated as follows:
   5 + 0 = 5.

So, the solution to the given expression '5 + 3#2' is 5.

1. Identify the operators in the expression: @ (concatenation) and + (addition).
2. According to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to first evaluate addition and concatenation within parentheses. However, there are no parentheses in the problem.
3. Since there is no addition within the @ symbol, we can directly apply the concatenation operation.
4. Perform concatenation: 5 + 2 = 7, and 7 @ 4 = 74.

So the solution to the problem is: The answer is 74."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem with the new mathematical operations and updated order of operations, we first need to perform prime factor counting for each number:

1. For 8: Prime factors are 2, 2, and 2. Since we share 2 twice, the result is 2.
2. For 2: Prime factor is 2, so the result is 1.
3. For 6: Prime factors are 2 and 3. No shared prime factors, so the result is 0.

Now, we apply the updated order of operations: P (no parentheses), F (prime factor counting), M/D (multiplication and division), A/S (addition and subtraction), and C (concatenation).

1. Perform prime factor counting for each number: 8#2 = 2 and 6#6 = 0.
2. Since multiplication and division have the same precedence (highest), we cannot perform them yet. We need to do addition and subtraction first, since they have a lower precedence.
3. There's only addition in this problem, no subtraction, so we can then perform the addition: 2 + 0 = 2.
4. Finally, we can perform multiplication: 2 * 6 = 12.

Since there is no concatenation in this problem, the final answer remains as 12.

The answer is 12."

1. Evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F): Since there is no 'and' sign present between 4 and 3, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting for each of them separately.

    A. The prime factor counting for 4: 4 = 2² × 2³
    B. The prime factor counting for 3: 3 = 3

2. Since there is no sharing of prime factors between 4 and 3, the prime factor counting operation for the given expression, 4 # 3, evaluates to 0.

3. Evaluate Addition and Subtraction (S): Since there is a '+' sign between 2 and the result of the prime factor counting operation (0), we need to perform the addition.

    A. Result of the prime factor counting: 0
    B. Value of the addend '2': 2

3. Multiplication and Division (M/D): Since there is no multiplication in this problem, we skip this step.

4. Concatenation (C): Concatenate the results of step 1 and 2, but since there is subtraction later, we need to perform the concatenation after that.

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Perform subtraction before addition, as it has a higher precedence in the new order of operations.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 5 + 3#2, we need to follow the new order of operations: PEFMDASC. Since there are no parentheses or exponents in this expression, we can skip those steps.

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): For computation of 3#2, we first count the unique prime factors of the absolute values of 3 and 2:
   Prime factors of 3 are: 3
   Prime factors of 2 are: 2
   Since both 3 and 2 have the prime factor 2 in common, the prime factor count is 1. So, 3#2 = 1.

2. Multiplication and Division (M/D): Since there is no multiplication or division in this problem, we can skip this step.

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in the expression, so move on to the next operation.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents in the expression, so move on to the next operation.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We don't have enough information about the numbers involved (a and b) in the concatenation (a @ b) to perform prime factor counting, so this operation can't be applied yet.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There are no multiplication or division operations in the expression, so move on to the next operation.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We need to evaluate the addition sign (+) before the concatenation (@). Perform the addition:

1. 8#2:The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2, 2, which has a count of 5.
The prime factors of 2 are 2, with a count of 1. Since there is only one unique prime factor between 2 and 8, the result is 5.

2. 6#6: The prime factors of 6 are 2, 2, 3, which has a count of 3.
The prime factors of 6 are the same as 6 itself, so there are no unique prime factors common between 6 and 6, and the result is 0.

Now, we use the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC) to add the results of the prime factor counting step:

P: We don't have any parentheses in this problem
E: None, we haven't evaluated any exponents
F: 5 (result of 8#2)
M/D: 0 (result of 6#6)
A/S: We will add results of M/D operation

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
First, we need to perform prime factor counting for the given numbers 4 and 3.

The prime factorization of 4 is 2 x 2 x 2 x 1 = 2^3. The prime factors of 3 are 3 and 1 from the given expression. Since there is no shared prime factor between 2^3 and 3, the result is 0 as per the definition.

Step 2: Addition and Subtraction (AS)
Since there is no addition sign before the concatenation operator (@), we presume there's an implicit addition sign before 4 which makes the given expression 4 + 3 or 3 + 4. We'll proceed with 3 + 4.

Step 3: Concatenation (C)
As per the order, we need to perform concatenation next. Since there's no operation to be performed on the numbers as such, let's just note down the sequence of numbers - 3 and 4.

Step 4: Addition and Subtraction (AS)
Now, we'll evaluate the addition part of our expression - 3 + 4 = 7

Step 5: Concatenation (C)
Finally, concatenate the result from step 4 with the original number 4. Concatenation of 7 and 4 yields 74 [Since addition comes before concatenation, we had 7 added to 4 not concatenated to form 74, and then concatenated]
