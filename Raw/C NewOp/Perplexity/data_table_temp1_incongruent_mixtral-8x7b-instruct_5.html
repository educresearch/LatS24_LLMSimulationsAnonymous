      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow the rules step by step.<br><br>1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in this problem, so we move to the next step.<br>2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this problem, so we move to the next step.<br>3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We count the number of unique prime factors shared by 2 and 4. Since 2 and 4 share one prime factor (which is 2), we have 1 as the result of this operation. However, based on the order of operations, we must wait to perform this step until addition is done.<br>4. Multiplication, Division: There are no multiplication or division operations in this problem, so we move to the next step.<br>5. Addition, Subtraction (A): We perform the addition operation first: 5 + 2. The result is 7.<br>6. Concatenation (C): We can now concatenate 7 with the result of the prime factor counting operation in step 3: 7 @ 1. The result is 71.<br><br>The answer is 71.</td>
