systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

4 # 3 = number of unique prime factors shared by 4 and 3

Prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
Prime factors of 3 are 3.
Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, the result of 4 # 3 is 0.

In this case, there are no Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, or Division, so we start with Prime Factor Counting (F). 

First, let's calculate 8 # 2:

The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 2 are just 2. Since they share one prime factor, 8 # 2 = 1.

Next, let's calculate 6 # 6:

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 6 are the same: 2 and 3. Since they share two prime factors (2 and 3), 6 # 6 = 2.

Now, we proceed to Addition:

1 + 2 = 3

                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: Let's break down the expression using the revised order of operations, PEFMDASC.

The expression given to us is: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

First, let's handle what's in the parentheses:
(14 + 4) = 18

So, the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we handle Concatenation (C), which is denoted by @:
But we need to remember that Concatenation operates on two numbers without any consideration of their values e.g., 6 @ 18 becomes 618.

So, the expression becomes: 618 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we handle Prime Factor counting (F), which is denoted by #:
However, in this particular case, we can't perform the Prime Factor counting operation yet because we don't have any numbers that are either multiplied or divided together. We'll have to wait until we perform those operations.

The next operation in the order is Addition (A) and Subtraction (S):
618 + 12 = 630

So, the expression becomes: 630 - 2 # 3

Now, we can handle Subtraction (S):
630 - 2 = 628

And now, we have to satisfy the final operation, Prime Factor counting (F), with this new number:
The prime factors of 628 are 2 and 157 (no shared prime factors).
Therefore, 2 # 3 = 0 as per definition.

Finally, we have arrived at the answer:

The answer is 628."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b.

                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1.

First, find the prime factors of the absolute values of the numbers. The numbers are 5, 3, and 2.

5 has no unique prime factors (it is a prime number itself), so its count of unique prime factors is 0.
3 has one unique prime factor, which is 3 itself.
2 has one unique prime factor, which is 2.

Now, since there are no shared prime factors between 5 and 3, and none between 5 and 2, the result for the F operation is 0. But we have to compare this result with the other number 2, since we have the # operation between 3 and 2. So check for the shared prime factors between 3 and 2. They have no shared prime factors, so the result for the F operation is 0.

Step 2: Perform the addition operation (A).
Now, add the results from Step 1: 0 + 3 (which is just the number 3, since the F operation with 3 and 2 gave this result).

The answer is 3."
