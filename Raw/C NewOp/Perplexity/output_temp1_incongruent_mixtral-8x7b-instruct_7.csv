First, there are no parentheses or exponents to evaluate, so we move on to prime factor counting. However, 2@4 is a concatenation operation, not prime factor counting, so we can skip prime factor counting in this case.

Next, we evaluate the concatenation operation 2@4, which gives us 24.

Now, we move on to addition, and add 5 to the result of the concatenation operation:

5 + 24 = 29

Therefore, the answer is 29."

1. Parentheses: Calculate the expression within the parentheses first.
  14 + 4 = 18

2. Prime Factor counting (F): We have an operation (#) involving prime factor counting. Since this step comes before addition and subtraction in our new order of operations, we calculate this next.
  2 # 3 = 0, since 2 and 3 have no shared prime factors.

3. Concatenation (C): Now we handle the concatenation operation.
  6 @ 18 = 618

4. Addition and Subtraction (A and S): Finally, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right. But, in this case, we only have subtraction left.

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

First, evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation:

8 # 2 = 2 (since the prime factors of 8 are 2*2, and the prime factors of 2 are 2, so there is one shared prime factor, 2)

2 # 6 = 0 (since the prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 6 are 2*3, so there is no shared prime factor)

According to this order, we should first perform concatenation (C), then addition and subtraction (A/S), and finally prime factor counting (F).

First, let's evaluate the expression in the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18.

Next, we have the expression: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3.

We perform concatenation (C) first:
6 @ 18 = 618.

Now, we have the expression: 618 + 12 - 2#3.

We perform addition and subtraction (A/S) next:
618 + 12 = 630.

So, we have the expression: 630 - 2#3.

14 + 4 = 18

Step 2: Now we have the expression 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3.
Next, we need to perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation. However, we cannot do this yet, as we need to follow the order of operations. Continue with the rest of the operations up to this point.

Step 3: Perform Concatenation (C) operation.
6 @ 18 = 618
So the expression becomes 618 + 12 - 2 # 3.

Step 4: Perform Addition and Subtraction (A/S) operation from left to right.
618 + 12 = 630
The expression now becomes 630 - 2 # 3.

Step 5: Perform Prime Factor Counting (F) operation.
2 # 3 = 1

Step 6: Perform Addition and Subtraction (A/S) operation from left to right.
630 - 1 = 629

The answer is 629."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

Given expression: 5 + 3 # 2

Step 1: Perform the prime factor counting operation (F)
Since there is no need to count the prime factors of 3 (it has 1 unique prime factor) before doing the addition operation, we can directly proceed to perform prime factor counting operation (F) for 2.

So, the prime factor of 2 is 2 itself.

Step 2: Perform the addition operation (A)
Now, perform the addition operation (A) on the results from Step 1 (F) and the preceding number 3.

5 + 1 = 6

Step 3: Perform the Concatenation operation (if any) (C)
As no Concatenation operation is given in the expression after the above addition, we don't need to proceed further for Concatenation.

The answer is 6."
