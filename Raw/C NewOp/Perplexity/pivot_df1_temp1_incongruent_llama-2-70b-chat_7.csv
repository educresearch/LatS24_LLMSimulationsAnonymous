In the newly updated order of operations, concatenation (C) comes before addition and subtraction (A/S). Therefore, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first, which gives us 18. Then, we concatenate 6 with 18 to get 108. Next, we add 12 to get 120. Finally, we subtract 2#3, which is 2, to get 118.

llama-2-70b-chat,1,700,systemPrompt4,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's the step-by-step explanation using the PEFMDASC order:

llama-2-70b-chat,1,700,systemPrompt4,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: Sure! Let's work through the problem step by step, following the PEFMDASC order of operations.

1. Evaluate the prime factor counting:
8 # 2 = 8 # 2 = 0 (no shared prime factors)
6 # 6 = 6 # 6 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor between 6 and 6 is 6)
2. Evaluate the concatenation:
8 @ 2 = 8 @ 2 = 16
6 @ 6 = 6 @ 6 = 36
3. Evaluate the addition:
0 + 1 = 1
16 + 36 = 52
4. Evaluate the final answer:
The answer is 52.

So, 8 # 2+6 # 6 = 52.

It's important to note that in step 1, we evaluated the prime factor counting for both 8 and 2, and for 6 and 6, before moving on to the next step. This is because the order of operations states that we should evaluate all prime factor counting operations before moving on to the next step.

Also, in step 3, we concatenated 16 and 36 before adding them, since concatenation comes before addition in the order of operations.

I hope this helps clarify the process for solving problems using the new operations and the updated order of operations!"

The answer is 3.

Note: In this case, we can see that the prime factor counting operation (F) comes before the addition operation (A/S) in the PEFMDASC order. This is because we need to evaluate the shared prime factors between the two numbers before we can add them together."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,700,systemPrompt4,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's the step-by-step explanation for the given problem using the PEFMDASC order:

1. First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:

(14+4) = 18

So, the problem becomes:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

2. Next, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation:

2#3 = 2

So, the problem becomes:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2

3. Now, we need to evaluate the concatenation (C) operation:

6 @ 18 = 6 @ 1800 = 10800

So, the problem becomes:

10800 + 12 - 2

4. Next, we need to evaluate the addition (A) operation:

10800 + 12 = 10812

So, the problem becomes:

10812 - 2

5. Finally, we need to evaluate the subtraction (S) operation:

10812 - 2 = 10790

The answer is 10790.

I hope this step-by-step explanation helps clarify how to solve problems using the updated order of operations, including the new operations of concatenation and prime factor counting."
