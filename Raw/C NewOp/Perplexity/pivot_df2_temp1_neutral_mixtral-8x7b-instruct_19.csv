Next, we perform addition (A) on the result of (F) and 2:
2 + 2 = 4

Therefore, the answer is 4.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2, we need to follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC). According to this order, prime factor counting (F) has higher precedence than addition and subtraction (A/S).

First, perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation:
Prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
Prime factors of 3 are 3.
Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, the result of 4 # 3 is 0.

5 + 24 = 29

Therefore, the answer is 29.","GPT Response: For the expression 5 + 2 @ 4, we need to follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC). According to this order, we must perform any operations inside parentheses first, followed by exponents, then prime factor counting (F), multiplication and division (left to right), addition and subtraction (left to right), and finally concatenation (C).

In this expression, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we can move on to prime factor counting. However, there are no instances of the prime factor counting operation (#) in the expression, so we can skip this step.

Next, we move on to multiplication and division (M/D), but there are no multiplication or division operations in the expression.

After that, we perform addition and subtraction (A/S). In this expression, there is an addition operation, so we evaluate it as follows:

5 + 2 @ 4
= 5 + 2 @ 4 (there are no operations inside the parentheses, so just repeat the expression)
= 5 + 26 (evaluate the concatenation)
= 31

Therefore, the answer is 31.","GPT Response: First, we need to evaluate the concatenation operation since it comes before addition in the order of operations. 

2 @ 4 = 24

Now, replace 2 @ 4 with 24 in the expression.

5 + 24

The addition operation is then evaluated.

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: Let's solve this step by step, following the PEFMDASC order:

1. Parentheses: No parentheses in the expression, so move to the next operation.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents in the expression, so move to the next operation.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We calculate the prime factors of 2 and 4 first, which are 2 and 2. We see there is only one shared prime factor of 2, so 2 # 4 = 1.
4. Multiplication and Division: There are no multiplication or division in the expression, so move to the next operation.
5. Addition and Subtraction: Now we perform the addition, since there are no subtraction operations. 5 + 1 (result from the Prime Factor Counting step) = 6.
6. Concatenation (C): Finally, we perform the concatenation operation, which now is simply 6 @ 4 = 64 because there are no more operations left to evaluate.
