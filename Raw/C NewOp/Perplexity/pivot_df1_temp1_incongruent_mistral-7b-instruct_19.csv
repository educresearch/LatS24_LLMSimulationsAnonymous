mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: Based on the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to perform the prime factor counting operations between the numbers:

1. Calculate 8 # 2: Since 8 has prime factors 2 and 2, and 2 is the only shared prime factor between 8 and 2, the result is 1.
2. Calculate 6 # 2: Since 6 has prime factors 2 and 3, and 2 is not a prime factor of 2, the result is 0.
3. Calculate 6 # 6: Since 6 has prime factors 2 and 3, and 3 is also a prime factor of 6, the result is 2.

Now we can calculate the sum of 8 # 2 and 6 # 6 using the remaining operations in the updated order:

4. The result of the prime factor counting operations is 1 (from step 1) and 2 (from step 3). We perform addition (A) last:

The answer is 3."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: According to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), the first step is to perform the prime factor counting operation (F), so we calculate 4 # 3 = 0, since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 2 and 3, with no shared prime factors.

Then, since addition comes before prime factor counting in the new order of operations (A), we perform the addition, so the answer is 0 + 2 = 2.

The answer is 2."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression using the newly updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to identify which operations to perform first.

The expression is: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Since parentheses have the highest precedence, we will start by evaluating what's inside the parentheses:

1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18

Now, the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we have exponents, but there are no exponents in the expression, so the next operation is prime factor counting:

2. Evaluate prime factor counting: There are no common prime factors between 6, 18, 12, and 3, so the result is 0.

Now, we have multiplication and division, none in the expression, so we move on to addition and subtraction:

3. Evaluate addition and subtraction from left to right:
3.1. Subtract 2 from 12: 10
3.2. Concatenate 6 and 18: 618
3.3. Add the result with 6 @ 18 (which is 618): 626

So the final answer is:

The answer is 626."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: Based on the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to perform prime factor counting before addition. However, in this given expression, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we directly go to step 3.

Step 3 - Prime Factor Counting:
To find the prime factor count of 5 and 2, we need to identify their prime factors:
- The prime factors of 5 are 5
- The prime factors of 2 are 2

Since 5 and 2 share the prime factor 5, their prime factor count is 1.

Now, since there are no more operations left to perform, the final answer is:

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem using the newly introduced mathematical operations and updated order of operations, follow these steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
   First, let's calculate the prime factor counts for each number:

   a) 8 = 2³ × 2
   b) 2 = 2
   c) 6 = 2² × 3

2. Comparing prime factors between numbers:
   Since we are calculating the overlap of prime factors between numbers, first find the prime factors common to both 8 and 6:

   - Common prime factors: 2.

3. Prime factor count (F) calculation:
   The number of unique common prime factors between 8 and 6 is 1 (since there is only one 2 shared). So, 8 # 6 = 1.

4. Addition (A) and Concatenation (C):
   Now, calculate the given expression using the updated order of operations:

   Since addition (A) comes before concatenation (C), we need to perform the addition (2 + 6) first:

   a) Addition (A): 2 + 6 = 8

5. Concatenation (C):
   Now that we have the result of the addition, we can perform the concatenation (C):

   a) Concatenation (C): 1 @ 8 = 18

The final answer is:

The answer is 18."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: Given expression: 4 # 3 + 2

Since the order of operations has been revised to PEFMDASC, we need to follow this order to solve the expression.

First, we need to perform the prime factor counting operation (F):

4 # 3 = 0 (since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3).

Next, we move to the addition (A) since it is the next operation in the order of operations:

0 + 2 = 2

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem with the new operations and the updated order of operations, we need to follow the given sequence: P E F MDAS C. empire ruled by GA Simpson

1. Parentheses: Solve what's inside the parentheses first.
   (14 + 4) = 18

2. Exponents: No exponents in the expression, so we skip this step.

3. Prime Factor counting (#): We perform the prime factor counting operation for a and b where a = 6 and b = 18:
   Prime factors of 6: 2, 2, 3
   Prime factors of 18: 2, 2, 2, 3
   We have a common prime factor 2 (counted three times for 6 and twice for 18), so the prime factor counting operation results in a value of 3.

4. Multiplication and Division (MD): Since there are no multiplications in the expression, we skip this step.

5. Addition and Subtraction (AS): We perform addition and subtraction operations in the given order. Perform subtraction first as it appears before addition in the expression:
   6 @ (18 - 2) = 6 @ 16

6. Concatenation (C): We perform the concatenation operation:
   The answer is 616."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem using the new operations and the revised order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow the order of the operations as follows:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Since there are no parentheses or exponents in this expression, we can directly move to the next operation. However, since there are only two numbers involved, prime factor counting operation does not contribute to the final answer to this expression. So, the result of this operation is 0.
2. Addition and Subtraction (AS): Since there are only additions involved with no subtraction or negatives, we can simply perform the addition from left to right. So, the addition of 5 and 3 results in 8.
3. Concatenation (C): Since there is no multiplication, division or any other operation left to perform, we can directly evaluate the concatenation operation. As per the definition of concatenation, we need to concatenate the digits of the absolute values of the numbers involved. Since both the numbers are positive, we have |5| = 5 and |3| = 3. So, the concatenation of the digits of 5 and 3 is 53.

Therefore, the final answer to this problem, according to the newly updated order of operations, is:

The answer is 53."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 5 + 2@4, we need to follow the updated order of operations: PEFMDASC. In this case, the only parentheses involved are in the concatenation operation, so we'll first focus on that.

Since concatenation (C) has a lower precedence than addition (A/S), we need to evaluate the concatenation operation 2@4 first. According to the key examples provided, the concatenation operation consists of merging the digits of the two operands.

So, 2@4 = 24 (we concatenated the digits 2 and 4).

Now that we've evaluated the concatenation operation, we can move on to addition. Adding the number 5 to the concatenated result 24, we have:

5 + 24 = 29.

Therefore, the solution to the given problem is:

The answer is 29."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the new operations and order of operations, we need to follow the PEFMDASC rule.

First, let's deal with the prime factor counting operation (#):

Since we need to evaluate prime factor counting before addition, we'll find the prime factors for each number first and count how many shared prime factors they have:

* For 8: Prime factors: 2 × 2 × 2
* For 2: Prime factor: 2

Both numbers 8 and 2 share 1 prime factor, but since prime factors are unique in this context, this results in a prime factor counting operation of 0.

Now, let's perform the addition operation (+) with the results:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 0 + 6 # 6 = 6 (since we evaluate prime factor counting before addition)

Having determined that the prime factor counting operation and the first addition operation come out to be 6, the next operation we need to perform is the last concatenation operation (@).

Since we need to concatenate the results of the addition operation (6) with the last number (6), we apply the concatenation operation to the result:

Result = 6 @ 6 = 66

The final answer, in the form ""The answer is __,"" is:

The answer is 66."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: Based on the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, prime factor counting (#) should be performed before addition (+). Therefore, let's focus on finding the unique prime factors common to |3| and |4|. The prime factors of 3 are 3, and the prime factors of 4 are 2. Since there is only one common prime factor ""2,"" we have 3#4 = 1. Following the order of operations, the addition (+) is performed next: 1 + 2 = 3.

So, the solution to the problem 4#3 + 2 is:

1. Parentheses: Solve the expression inside the parentheses, which is 14 + 4 = 18.
2. Prime Factor Counting: For this part, we need to find the unique prime factors common to |6| and |18| and |18| and |3|. Since 3 is not a common prime factor with 6 and 18, and the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 while for 18 are 2 and 3, the prime factor counting is 0.
3. Concatenation: Since there are parentheses in the expression, we need to evaluate concatenation after that. So, we have 6 @ 18.
4. Multiplication and Division (left to right): In this case, we don't have these operations, but we still need to follow the order.
5. Addition and Subtraction (left to right): We have subtraction before addition. Let's evaluate subtraction: 12 - 2 = 10. Now, let's evaluate addition: 10 + 18 = 28.

Step 2: Perform the concatenation operation (represented by @ symbol). But first, calculate the absolute values of the operands (2 and 4), since concatenation is defined for absolute values only.

|2| @ |4|

Step 3: Apply the concatenation operation, which in this case, is simply the string combination of its absolute values. The absolute values of 2 and 4 are 2 and 4, respectively. So, 2@4 = 24.

The expression now looks like: 5 + 24

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
Calculate the prime factor count for each pair:
a) 8 and 2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2, 2. The prime factors of 2 are 2. So, the count of shared unique prime factors is 2.
b) 2 and 6: The prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 6 are 2, 2, 3. Since there are 2 twos, the count is 1.
c) 6 and 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2, 2, 3. Since all are present in both 6s, the count is 3.

So, the calculation of prime factor counting is: 8 # 2 = 2, 2 # 6 = 1, 6 # 6 = 3.

2. Concatenation (C):
Now, we perform concatenation (the last operation):
- 8 # 2 = 2
- 2 # 6 = 2
- 2 # 6 = 26
- The final step is to concatenate the results obtained in the previous steps.

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): First, find the prime factor count of 4 and 3. In this case, they share no prime factors: 4 = 2² * 2 * 7, 3 = 3. So, the prime factor count of 4 and 3 is 0.

2. Addition and Subtraction (AS): Since there's an addition sign, evaluate it next in the order. But in this case, it doesn't directly interact with the prime factor counting, so the sum can be calculated as 4 + 2 = 6.
