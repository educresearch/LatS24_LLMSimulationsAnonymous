6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:

14 + 4 = 18

So, the problem becomes:

Next, we need to evaluate the concatenation:

6 @ 18 = 6 @ 1800 (since 18 is concatenated with 00)

Now, we need to evaluate the subtraction:

10800 - 2#3
= 10800 - 2 (since 2 is the result of the prime factor count of 3)
= 10798

Finally, we add 12:

10798 + 12 = 10810
