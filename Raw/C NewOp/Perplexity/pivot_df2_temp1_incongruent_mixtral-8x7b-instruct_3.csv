mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: Following the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to perform prime factor counting (F) before addition (A).

First, find the unique prime factors of 4 and 3:
4 = 2^2, so it has one unique prime factor 2
3 is a prime number, so it has one unique prime factor 3

Then, find the count of shared prime factors (which is 0 in this case):
4 # 3 = 0

Next, perform addition (A):
0 (from the previous step) + 2 = 2

Therefore, the answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations, we first need to perform the prime factor counting operation (F), then the addition operation (A).

4 # 3 + 2
= 2 + 2 (since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and the prime factors of 3 are 3, so they share a prime factor of 2)
= 4

Therefore, the answer is 4.","GPT Response: First, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation. The prime factors of 4 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. There are no shared prime factors, so 4 # 3 equals 0.

Next, we have the addition operation. We add 0 (the result from the prime factor counting) and 2:

0 + 2 = 2

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Let's solve this problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations with the new mathematical operations:

1. Identify and perform Prime Factor Counting (F): There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so 4 # 3 = 0.
2. Perform Addition (A): Now we add the result of the prime factor counting operation (0) to 2.

The answer is 0 + 2.

Therefore,

The answer is 2."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), where we perform parenthesis operations first, then exponents, followed by prime factor counting, multiplication and division (from left to right), addition and subtraction (from left to right), and finally concatenation.

In this case, we are given:

5 + 2@4

Since there are no parenthesis or exponents to consider, we move on to prime factor counting. However, we see that we already have a @ operation before arriving at the # operation. So, we first perform the @ operation:

5 + 2@4 = 5 + 24

Now, we need to perform the addition. We don't have any other operations left to evaluate:

5 + 24 = 29

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: To solve the expression $5 + 2@4$, we first need to evaluate the concatenation operation since it comes before addition in the updated order of operations. The concatenation of $2$ and $4$ is $24$. Then, we can perform the addition operation:

$$5 + 24 = 29$$

The answer is $\boxed{29}$.","GPT Response: First, we need to evaluate the concatenation operation, which is 2 @ 4 = 24. Then, we can perform the addition operation: 5 + 24. Therefore, the answer is 29. The answer is 29.

Here are the steps:
1. 2 @ 4 = 24
2. 5 + 24 = 29

So, the answer is 29.","GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): There are no prime factor counting operations in this step, so we move on to the next step.
2. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There are no multiplication or division operations in this step, so we move on to the next step.
3. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We have an addition operation with three numbers: 5, 2, and the result of 4 @ 2. Let's first calculate the result of 4 @ 2.

4 @ 2 = 42 (the digits 4 and 2 are concatenated together)

Now that we have the result of 4 @ 2, we can complete the addition operation:

5 + 2 + 42 = 49

So, the answer is 49."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F). The prime factors of 3 are 3, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. They do not have any shared prime factors, so 3 # 2 = 0.

Now, we are left with the addition operation (A): 5 + 0. Adding 5 + 0 gives us 5.

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we must follow the new order of operations, PEFMDASC. In this case, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we can skip those steps.

The next operation in the order is F, prime factor counting. However, in this problem, there is no prime factor counting operation indicated by the # symbol.

Next in the order is M/D, multiplication and division. Again, there are no instances of these operations in the problem.

Next is A/S, addition and subtraction. There is an addition operation in the problem, so we will perform that next.

5 + 3 = 8

So now our problem is simplified to 8 # 2.

Performing the prime factor counting operation on 8 and 2, we find that they have one shared prime factor, which is 2. Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1.

So the final answer is 1, which is the result of performing the prime factor counting operation on 8 and 2 after first performing the addition operation on 5 and 3.

The answer is 1.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC).

First, we evaluate the prime factor counting (F) between 3 and 2, which is 0 since they share no common prime factors.

Then, we move to addition (A). So, we add 5 and 0 (the result of F operation), which results in 5.

The answer is 5.

(5 + 3 # 2 = 5 + 0 = 5)","GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. There are no Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, or Division in this expression. So, we proceed to the next operation.
2. Prime Factor counting (F): There is no need for prime factor counting in this step since there are no numbers being multiplied. So, we proceed to the next operation.
3. Addition (A): We add the numbers in the expression, disregarding the prime factor counting operation for now, as it is preceded by addition in the order:

2. Prime Factor counting (F): We need to do prime factor counting next.
   2 # 3 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor is 1)
3. Concatenation (C): Now we perform concatenation.
   6 @ 18 = 618
4. Subtraction (S): Perform subtraction at this step.
   618 + 12 = 630

The answer is 630.","GPT Response: Let's go through the problem step by step following the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Parentheses: Calculate the expression inside the parentheses first, which is 14 + 4.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this expression, so we can skip this step.
3. Prime Factor counting (F): We have the operation 2 # 3, which is the prime factor counting of 2 and 3. Since the only prime factor of 2 is 2 and 3 has no more prime factors other than itself, there are no shared prime factors. Therefore, 2 # 3 = 0.
4. Multiplication and Division: There are no multiplication or division operations in this expression, so we can skip this step.
5. Addition and Subtraction: First, perform 6 @ (14 + 4), which results in 6 @ 18 = 618 (since we have to calculate concatenation from left to right). Now, we perform the subtraction: 618 + 12 - 0.
6. Concatenation (C): Finally, there is one more concatenation operation: 618 + 12 = 62012.

The answer is 62012.","GPT Response: First, we need to evaluate the expression in the parentheses:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Next, we perform the prime factor counting operation:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3 = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3 = 66 + 12 - 2#3

Now, we calculate the prime factorization for the remaining concatenation operation:

66 + 12 - 2#3 = 66 + 12 - 2#3 = 66 + 12 - 2#3 = 66 + 12 - 2#3 = 66 + 12 - 2#3 = 66 + 12 - 2#3 = 66 + 12 - 2#3 = 66 + 12 - 2#3 = 66 + 12 - 2#3 = 66 + 12 - 2#3 = 66 + 12 - 2#3 = 66 + 12 - 2#3 = 66 + 12 - 2#3 = 66 + 12 - 2#3 = 66 + 12 - 2#3 = 66 + 12 - 2#3 = 66 + 12 - 2#3 = 66 + 12 - 2#3 = 66 + 12 - 2#3 = 66 + 12 - 0

66 + 12 - 0 = 66 + 12 - 0 = 66 + 12 = 78

The answer is 78.","GPT Response: Let's tackle the problem using the PEFMDASC order of operations, taking into account the new mathematical operations Concatenation (C) and Prime Factor Counting (F).

Step 1: Parentheses
14 + 4 = 18

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
2 # 3 = 0 (since prime factors of 2 are 2 and prime factors of 3 are 3; no shared prime factors)

Step 3: Concatenation (C)
6 @ 18 (no operations remain between concatenation and 6 @ 18)

Step 4: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
Now, we'll perform the first subtraction operation.
6 @ 18 + 12 = 618 + 12 (since concatenation has higher priority)

Step 5: Concatenation (C)
Next, we need to perform the concatenation between the result from the previous step and 2.
61812 @ 2

Step 6: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
