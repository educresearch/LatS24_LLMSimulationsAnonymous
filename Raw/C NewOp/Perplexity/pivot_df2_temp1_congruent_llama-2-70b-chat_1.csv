2. Exponents: None
3. Prime Factor Counting: 5 # 2 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor between 5 and 2 is 1)
4. Multiplication and Division (L to R): 5 @ 4 = 20
5. Addition and Subtraction (L to R): 5 + 2 = 7
6. Concatenation (L to R): 7 @ 20 = 720

The answer is 720.","GPT Response: The given problem is 5+2 @ 4.

First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses, which is 2 @ 4.

Using the concatenation operation, we have 2 @ 4 = 024 = 24.

Now, we add 5 to 24, which gives us 29.

Therefore, the final answer is 29.

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: The given problem is 5+2 @ 4.

According to the updated order of operations, we need to follow the following steps:

1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 2 @ 4 = 2(4) = 8
2. Evaluate the addition: 5 + 8 = 13

Therefore, the final answer is 13.

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: Sure, here's the step-by-step explanation for the expression 5+2 @ 4 using the PEFMDASC order:

1. First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 2 @ 4 = 2(4) = 8
2. Next, we need to calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation: 5 # 8 = 5(8) = 40
3. Then, we need to calculate the Multiplication/Division (M/D) operation from left to right: 5(40) = 200
4. After that, we need to calculate the Addition/Subtraction (A/S) operation from left to right: 200 + 5 = 205
5. Finally, we need to concatenate the remaining digits: 205 @ 8 = 205(8) = 1640

The answer is 1640.

It's important to note that we need to follow the PEFMDASC order to ensure accuracy in our calculations. In this case, we need to evaluate the concatenation operation last, after all other operations have been performed."

1. P: Parentheses

The given expression is 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3.

First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 14+4 = 18.

So, the updated expression becomes 6@18 + 12-2 # 3.

2. E: Exponents

There are no exponents in this expression.

3. F: Prime Factor Counting

The next operation is prime factor counting. We need to find the shared prime factors between the absolute values of 6 and 3.

6 = 2 x 3
3 = 3

The shared prime factor between 6 and 3 is 3. So, 6 # 3 = 1.

4. M/D: Multiplication and Division (left to right)

Now, we need to evaluate the multiplication: 6@18 = 108.

5. A/S: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)

Next, we need to evaluate the addition: 108 + 12 - 2 = 118.

6. C: Concatenation (left to right)

Finally, we need to evaluate the concatenation: 118 @ 3 = 1183.

The answer is 1183.
