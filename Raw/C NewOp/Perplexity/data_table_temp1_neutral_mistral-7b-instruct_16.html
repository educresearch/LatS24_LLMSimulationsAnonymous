      <td>GPT Response: To solve the given Mathematics problem 4 # 3 +2 with the newly introduced mathematical operations and updated order of operations, we need to follow the given order of PEFMDASC:<br><br>1. Prime Factor counting (F): To find the number of unique prime factors shared between 4 and 3, we note that the prime factors of 4 are {2, 2}, and the prime factors of 3 are {2, 3}. Since 2 is a shared prime factor, the prime factor count is 1.<br>2. Concatenation (C): Since concatenation comes after prime factor counting in the order of operations, we concatenate the digits of the absolute values of the operands. In this case, since there is only one operand with a negative sign (-3), we need to take the absolute value of it before concatenating. Therefore, we have |4| = 4 and |-3| = 3, and their concatenation is 4 and 3, which results in 43.<br>3. Addition (A): Finally, we perform the addition of the result obtained from step 2 (which is a single digit number 43) and the other operand 2.<br><br>So, the solution would be:<br><br>The answer is: 43 + 2 = 45.</td>

Perform prime factor counting (F): Let's find common prime factors for the absolute values of 8 and 2 (2 and 8) and 6 and 6 (both 2 and 3). Prime factors of 2 are common in both pairs, so their count is 1.<br>   - For 8 and 2: 8 # 2 = 1<br>   - For 6 and 6: 6 # 6 = 1<br>4.

Perform concatenation from left to right (C): Now, we can perform the concatenation operations.<br>   - For 8 # 2: The result of prime factor counting is 1, which does not affect the concatenation of the digits.
