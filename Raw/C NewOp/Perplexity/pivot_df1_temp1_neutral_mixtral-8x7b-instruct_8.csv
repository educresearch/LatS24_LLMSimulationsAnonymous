mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the expression `5 + 2 @ 4`, we need to follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), which means we should first evaluate the concatenation operation `@` before addition.

First, calculate `2 @ 4`:
2 @ 4 = 24

Now, replace `2 @ 4` with 24 and evaluate the expression:
5 + 24

Lastly, perform the addition:
5 + 24 = 29

The answer is 29."

First, perform the operation in the parentheses:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Then, perform the prime factor counting operation:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 (since 2 is the only shared prime factor of 2 and 3, 2 # 3 = 1)

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. Parentheses: there are no parentheses in this problem, so we move on to the next step.
2. Exponents: there are no exponents in this problem, so we move on to the next step.
3. Prime Factor counting (F): we need to evaluate 3 # 2. The prime factors of 3 are 3, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since there are no shared prime factors, we have 3 # 2 = 0.
4. Multiplication and Division (M and D): there are no multiplication or division operations in this problem, so we move on to the next step.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A and S): we need to evaluate 5 + 0 (from step 3). The sum of 5 + 0 is 5.
6. Concatenation (C): there are no concatenation operations in this problem, so we can skip this step.

Therefore, the solution to 5 + 3 # 2 is 5.

The answer is 5."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Let's break down the expression using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. There are no parentheses or exponents, so we move on to the next operations.
2. There is no prime factor counting (F) or multiplication/division (M/D), so we move on to the next operation.
3. We encounter addition (A) before concatenation (C), but since we cannot perform addition with a number and a concatenation, we need to evaluate the concatenation first.
4. In the concatenation (2 @ 4), we are simply combining the digits of 2 and 4, so 2 @ 4 = 24.
5. Now, our expression becomes 5 + 24.
6. We can now perform the addition operation, which results in 29.

1. Parentheses: Calculate the expression inside the parentheses first, which is 14 + 4.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this expression.
3. Prime Factor counting (F): Now we perform the prime factor counting operation on 2 # 3. The prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since they do not share any common prime factors, 2 # 3 = 0.

Now, we perform addition (A), since there are no other operations with higher precedence:

5 + 1

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: Let's break down the expression using the PEFMDASC order of operations with the new operations explained earlier.

The expression given to us is: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

First, let's calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) for the pair 8 # 2:

8's prime factors are 2 * 2 * 2, so there are 3 twos.
2's prime factors are 2 * 1, so there are 1 two.

They share 1 prime factor, and that's the number 2. Hence, 8 # 2 = 1.

Next, calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) for the pair 6 # 6:

6's prime factors are 2 * 3, so there are 1 two and 1 three.
6's prime factors are 2 * 3, so there are 1 two and 1 three.

They share 2 prime factors: 2 and 3. Hence, 6 # 6 = 2.

Now we are left with the addition part (A), 1 + 2.

Therefore, the final answer for the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 is:

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: Let's solve this problem using the revised order of operations PEFMDASC and focusing on the new operations Concatenation (C) and Prime Factor Counting (F).

4 # 3 + 2

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Calculate the unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 4 and 3.

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
The prime factors of 3 are 3 (since 3 is a prime number and has no other prime factors).
There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so the Prime Factor Counting of 4 and 3 is 0.

Step 2: Addition (+)
Perform the addition now that Prime Factor Counting is complete.

0 + 2 = 2
