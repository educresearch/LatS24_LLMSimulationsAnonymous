llama-2-70b-chat,1,700,systemPrompt4,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step, following the PEFMDASC order of operations.

1. First, we need to calculate the prime factor counting (F) operation:

8 # 2 = 8 # 2 = 4 (since the prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 1, and the prime factors of 2 are 2, 1)

6 # 6 = 6 # 6 = 1 (since the prime factors of 6 are 2, 3, and the prime factors of 6 are 2, 3)
2. Next, we need to calculate the concatenation (C) operation:

8 @ 2 = 8 @ 2 = 16 (since the digits of 8 are 8, 8, and the digits of 2 are 2, 2)

6 @ 6 = 6 @ 6 = 36 (since the digits of 6 are 6, 6, and the digits of 6 are 6, 6)
3. Now, we need to calculate the addition (A) operation:

16 + 36 = 52

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 52."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,700,systemPrompt4,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: Sure! Here's the step-by-step explanation for the problem 4#3 + 2 using the PEFMDASC order:

1. First, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation: 4#3 = 4 # 3 = 1
2. Next, we need to evaluate the addition (A) operation: 4#3 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3.

In this problem, we can see that the prime factor counting operation is evaluated first, since it is represented by the symbol #. Then, we evaluate the addition operation, which is represented by the symbol +. Finally, we concatenate the results of the prime factor counting and addition operations to get the final result, which is 3.

It's important to note that the order of operations is crucial in this problem, since evaluating the addition operation before the prime factor counting operation would give us a different result. For example, if we evaluate the addition operation first, we would get 4 + 2 = 6, and then we would evaluate the prime factor counting operation as 6 # 3 = 2, which would give us a final result of 2. However, this is not the correct order of operations, and we would get a wrong answer.

Therefore, it's important to follow the PEFMDASC order strictly, and evaluate the operations in the correct order to get the correct result."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,700,systemPrompt4,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's the step-by-step explanation for the given problem using the PEFMDASC order:

1. Concatenation (C): 6 @ (14 + 4) = 6 @ 18 = 6 @ 18 = 186
2. Addition (A/S): 186 + 12 = 198
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): 198 - 2 # 3 = 198 - 1 = 197

The answer is 197.

Here's a breakdown of each step:

1. In the first step, we use concatenation to join the digits of 6 and 18 together, resulting in 186.
2. In the second step, we add 12 to 186, resulting in 198.
3. In the third step, we use prime factor counting to subtract the number of shared prime factors between 198 and 3. Since there is only one shared prime factor (2), we subtract 1 from 198, resulting in 197.

It's important to note that we need to follow the PEFMDASC order strictly to avoid mistakes. In this case, we need to evaluate the concatenation operation before adding 12, and we need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation before subtracting 2 # 3."
