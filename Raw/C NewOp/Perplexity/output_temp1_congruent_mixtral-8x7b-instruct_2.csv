1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in this problem, so we move on to the next operation.

5. Addition and Subtraction (A and S, from left to right): We have an addition operation: 5 + 2. We perform this operation first.
   - 5 + 2 = 7
6. Concatenation (C, from left to right): We now have a concatenation operation: 7 @ 4. However, since there is no absolute value sign around 7, we must preserve its sign. So we concatenate -7 and 4 instead of simply 7 and 4.

The prime factors of $6$ are $2 \times 3$, and the prime factors of $6$ are $2 \times 3$. Therefore, $6 \# 6 = 2$.

1. Parentheses: Calculate the expression inside the parentheses first: 14 + 4 = 18.
2. Concatenation: Since concatenation is next in the order of operations, calculate 6 @ 18: 6 @ 18 = 618.
3. Prime Factor Counting: The problem has another operation (subtraction) before we reach the prime factor counting operation; therefore, evaluate the subtraction first: 12 - 2 = 10.
4. Prime Factor Counting: Now, calculate 3 # 10. The prime factors of 3 are 3 and of 10 are 2 and 5, so 3 and 10 have no shared prime factors: 3 # 10 = 0.

Now we have completed all the operations:

The answer is 618 + 10.

                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together.

                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)

1. Since there are no parentheses or exponents in the expression, we proceed to the next operation in the order, which is Prime Factor Counting (F). However, in this particular expression, there are no appearances of the prime factor counting operation (#).
2. The next operation in the order is Multiplication and Division (M/D), but neither of these operations appears in the expression.
3. We now move on to Addition and Subtraction (A/S), and we see that there is an addition operation (5 + 2). So, let's perform this operation first:
   - 5 + 2 = 7
4. The next (and final) operation in the order is Concatenation (C). We see that there is a concatenation operation (2 @ 4) in the expression. Now, we should perform this concatenation:
   - 2 @ 4 = 24
5. As the final step, replace the original expression with the calculated value:
   - The answer is 7 @ 24 (or 724 after concatenation is performed).

                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: Let's break down the given expression using the revised order of operations PEFMDASC and the new mathematical operations Concatenation (C) and Prime Factor Counting (F).

The expression: 6@(14+4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses
14 + 4 = 18
So, the expression becomes: 6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
We don't have any shared prime factors yet, so there's no change. Let's continue with the order of operations.

Step 3: Concatenation (C)
There are no operations involving concatenation left to do, so let's move on with the rest of the operations.

Step 4: Exponents
There are no exponents in the expression, so there's no change.

Step 5: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
There are no multiplication or division operations left to do.

Step 6: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
First, do the addition:
6@18 + 24 # 3

Now, do the subtraction:
88 + 24 # 3

Step 7: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Calculate the shared prime factors of 88 and 24, which is 2:
88 # 24 = 2

The answer is 112.

So, 6@(14+4) + 12 - 2 # 3 = 112."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together.

                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
