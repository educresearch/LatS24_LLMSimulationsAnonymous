mistral-7b-instruct,1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression 4#3 + 2 according to the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to perform prime factor counting:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
The prime factors of 4 are 2 (appears twice) and 2.
The prime factors of 3 are 2 and 3.
There is only one prime factor 2 that is common to both 4 and 3, so the prime factor counting (#) operation results in 1.

Now, since addition comes before prime factor counting in the order of operations, we can perform the addition:

The answer is 1 + 2 = 3.","GPT Response: According to the new order of operations PEFMDASC, prime factor counting (F) should be done before addition (A). In this case, we have 4#3 and then addition of the result with 2.

First, let's calculate 4#3:
Since the prime factorization of 4 is 2² and 2, which is shared with 3, having prime factors 2 and 3, there is only 1 unique shared prime factor, i.e., the prime factor counting operation results in 1.

So, the expression 4#3 equals 1.

Now, we add the result of 4#3 to 2:
1 + 2 = 3.

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Given operation: 4 # 3 + 2

Explanation:

1. Prime Factor Counting (#):
   Since we are performing the prime factor counting operation first, we need to find the common prime factors of |4| = 2²² and |3| = 3. Since the prime factors of 4 are 2²² and the prime factors of 3 are 3, there is no common prime factor, so the result of the prime factor counting is 0.

2. Addition (A):
   Now, we move on to the addition operation (+). We add the result of the prime factor counting (0) and the second number, which is 2. So, the result of this step is 2.

3. Concatenation (C):
   Since we still have one more operation left to perform, which is concatenation (@), we need to evaluate the sum (2) before concatenating it with the first number (4). But in this case, since there are no more mathematical operations left, we don't need to perform concatenation at all.

In summary, since there was no need to concatenate in the given problem, our final answer does not involve any concatenation operation. Therefore, the answer is 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
We need to find the prime factor count of 4 and 3.
The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
The prime factors of 3 are 3.
Since there is no shared prime factor, the prime factor count is 0.

Step 2: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
0 (from the result of prime factor counting) + 2
The answer is 2."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to identify which operations need to be performed first. In this expression, we have addition (""+"") and concatenation (""@""). According to the new order of operations, concatenation comes after addition.

So, the correct sequence of operations for this expression is as follows:

1. Addition: 5 + 2
2. Concatenation: 5 + 2 @ 4

First, let's do the addition:

5 + 2 = 7

Next, perform concatenation:

7 @ 4 = 74

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: Based on the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to evaluate the concatenation operation between 2 and 4, which gives us the result 24. Then, we can perform the addition operation between 5 and 24.

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: To solve the problem with the updated mathematical operations and order, we need to follow the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in the given expression.
2. Exponents: None present.
3. Prime Factor Counting: None present.
4. Multiplication and Division: @ is the multiplication symbol (@ is the concatenation symbol now), and 2 is a number, so we have multiplication. We perform multiplication before addition as per the updated order. So, we will apply the concatenation operation between 2 and 4.
5. Addition and Subtraction: Finally, we apply the addition operation to the result obtained in step 4.

Using the given input, we have:

5 + 2@4

Since 2@4 means we will concatenate 2 and 4, thus, the expression becomes:

5 + 24

Finally, we apply the addition operation:

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 2@4 using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to follow these steps:

1. The concatenation operation comes before addition, so we must perform 2@4 first:

   2@4 = 24

2. Now, the expression becomes: 5 + 24

3. Addition (A/S) is next in the order of operations, so we perform it now:

mistral-7b-instruct,1,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: Based on the expanded order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F) between the numbers 3 and 2. Since there are no common prime factors (the prime factors of 2 are 2 and there are no common prime factors with 3), the result of the prime factor counting operation is 0.

Next, we move on to the addition operation (A). Therefore, the problem becomes evaluating the addition of 5 and the result of the prime factor counting operation (0). The result of 5 + 0 is 5.

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: According to the revised order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to perform prime factor counting (F):

Since the prime factors of 5 are 5 and 5, and prime factors of 3 are 3 and 3, and prime factors of 2 are 2, we have 2 unique prime factors in common between 5 and 3, and 1 prime factor in common between 5 and 2.

Considering 5+3 # 2. Since the prime factor counting (F) should be performed before addition (A), the problem breaks down into two parts:

Part 1: Prime factor counting for 5+3 = 8
When we consider the sum of 5 and 3, their prime factors are 5, 3, and 2. Since there are 2 unique prime factors in common between 5 and 3, and 1 prime factor in common between each number and 2, the total number of unique prime factors shared among these numbers is 3.

Part 2: Addition
Now that we calculated the prime factor count, we can proceed to add the numbers.

5 + 3 = 8

So, the answer is:

The answer is 8.","GPT Response: To solve the problem 5 + 3 # 2 according to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to first calculate the prime factor counting (#) operation:

1. Prime factor counting: 3 and 2 share no common prime factors, thus their prime factor counting is 0.

Now, we can perform the addition (A):

1. Addition: 5 + 3 = 8

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 8.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 3 # 2 using the PEFMDASC order, we need to follow these steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Identify the unique prime factors in the absolute values of 3 and 2:
   - The prime factors of 3 are 3.
   - The prime factors of 2 are 2.
2. Since there is only one symbol in the current step and no other operations, we directly move to the next step, which is Multiplication and Division (M/D).
3. There are no multiplication or division symbols present in our expression, so we proceed to the next operation: Addition and Subtraction (A/S).
4. Addition: We have two numbers, 5 and the result of the prime factor counting operation between 3 and 2, which is 1.
   We add these two numbers: 5 + 1 = 6
5. Concatenation (C): We now have 6 as the results of previous operations. However, the original expression does not contain any concatenation symbol.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression with the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to apply the rules for parentheses, exponents, prime factor counting, multiplication and division, addition and subtraction, and finally concatenation.

1. Parentheses:
The expression has parentheses, so we need to calculate what is inside first:

(14 + 4)
18

2. Prime factor counting:
Since we have a prime factor counting operation (#) before an addition (+), we need to evaluate prime factor counting before addition:

6 @ 18 # 3
No shared prime factors between 6 and 18, so the result is 0.

3. Concatenation:
Now we have a concatenation (@) operation before a subtraction (-), so we need to evaluate concatenation before subtraction:

6 @ 18 = 618

4. Subtraction:
Now we have a subtraction (-) operation, so we need to calculate this:

618 - 2
616

5. Addition:
Lastly, we need to evaluate the addition (+) operation:

616 + 12

The answer is 628.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the newly introduced mathematical operations and the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), let's break it down step by step:

1. Parentheses: Solve the expression inside the parentheses first:
   = 14 + 4

2. Prime factor counting (#): Perform the prime factor counting operation:
   = 6 @ 18

3. Multiplication and Division (M/D): Since there is no division in this expression, we move on to the next operation.

4. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Since there is a subtraction sign, we perform that operation before concatenation.

   = 6 @ (18 - 2)

5. Subtraction: Solve the subtraction part:
   = 16

6. Concatenation (C): Apply the concatenation operation:

   = 6 @ 16

The answer is 616.","GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations, which is PEFMDASC.

First, we deal with parentheses:

6 @ (14 + 4)

Now, we perform the addition inside the parentheses:

6 @ (18)

Next, we perform concatenation:

6 @ 18 = 618

So far, we have: 618

Now, we perform prime factor counting:

There is no shared prime factor between 618 and 3, so the prime factor count of 618 and 3 is 0.

So, the full expression becomes:

618 (final answer)

Therefore, the answer is 618.","GPT Response: Step 1: Solve the expression inside the parentheses (14 + 4) using the order of operations PEFMDASC. Since parentheses have the highest precedence, we will start by evaluating it:

(14 + 4) = 18

Step 2: Now that we have the value of the expression inside the parentheses, we can concatenate the result (18) with 6 according to the updated order of operations:

6 @ 18 = 186

Step 3: Next, we need to do the addition and subtraction in the expression using the PEFMDASC order:

The expression contains only one addition (+) and one subtraction (-). The addition should be performed before the subtraction according to the updated order of operations (M/D > A/S):

186 + 12 = 198

Step 4: Finally, we need to perform the prime factor counting operation (#):

198 # 3 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor in the absolute values of 198 and 3 is 2, but since both numbers are positive, only one count is considered).

Step 5: Putting it all together, we have:

   - The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2 (since 8 = 2³ x 2).
   - The prime factors of 2 are 2.
   - The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
   - The prime factors of 6 are shared between 2 and 6 twice, so the prime factor counting operation (#) is 2 x 2 = 4.

Therefore, the solution to the given problem with the new operations and order of operations is:

The answer is 6.","GPT Response: To solve the given problem with the newly introduced mathematical operations and updated order of operations, follow these steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting (#): Find the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of the operands.
   - In this case, the operands are 8 and 2, and 6 and 6.
   - Since 8's prime factors are 2³, 2, and 2, and 2's prime factors are 2, there is one shared prime factor, 2. So 8 # 2 = 1.
   - Since 6's prime factors are 2³, 2, and 3, and 6's prime factors are 2³, 2, and 3, there are two shared prime factors, 2³ and 2. So 6 # 6 = 2.

2. Multiplication and Division (M/D): Perform multiplication and division operations, following the order from left to right.

Given expression: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Step 1: Find the prime factor count for each number.

The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, so 8 # 2 = 1 (since they have only one common prime factor: 2).

The prime factors of 2 are 2 (since 2 is a prime number).

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, so 6 # 6 = 2 (since they have a common prime factor: 2).

1 + 2 = 3

Step 3: Perform the concatenation operation.

So, 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 (from prime factor counting) + 3 (from addition) = 4, but since we need to perform concatenation in the end, we need to combine the digits 1 and 4 to get the final answer: 14.

   6 # 6 = 3 (since both numbers share 2 and 2 as prime factors)

2. Next, do any multiplication (M) and division (D) as needed, but since there are no exponents or multiplication or division operations present, we can move on to the next step.
