systemPrompt1_userPrompt1_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.

                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1.

                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

systemPrompt1_userPrompt1_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem with the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to handle the concatenation operation (C). However, in this case, the addition sign (A) is directly connected to the @ symbol, so we cannot evaluate the addition before the concatenation. Therefore, we need to remember the current expression and use parentheses to hold the addition sign and the concatenation operation for later evaluation.

So, our first step would be to apply parentheses:

(5 + 2) @ 4

Now, we can follow the updated order of operations:
1. Parentheses: We've already applied them.
2. Exponents: None in this expression.
3. Prime Factor counting (F): For this expression, we cannot perform prime factor counting as we don't have two numbers to compare their prime factors.
4. Multiplication and Division (M and D): None in this expression.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A and S): We have an addition sign ""+"". We should evaluate it before the concatenation, as per the given order of operations PEFMDASC.
6. Concatenation (C): We've held off the concatenation operation until now, as it is the last operation in our order of operations.

Therefore, the solution is:

First, do the addition operation (A): 5 + 2 = 7
Next, perform the concatenation (C): 7 @ 4 = 74

So, the final answer is: The answer is 74."

                    Two new operations were defined:

                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in this expression, so we move on to the next operation.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this expression, so we move on to the next operation.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We need to find the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 8 and 2, and 6 and 6:

- For 8 and 2, the prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2, and 2, while the prime factors of 2 are just 2. So they have 2 shared prime factors.
- For 6 and 6, they both have the same prime factors, 2 and 3, with a count of 2 for each. Since prime factors are unique, we only count each prime factor once, so the shared prime factor count is 2.

The prime factor counting operation for 8 # 2 gives us a result of 2, and for 6 # 6, it also results in 2.

Since prime factor counting is before addition, we have 2 + 2 = 4 as the result of this step.

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There are no multiplication or division operations in this expression, so we move on to the next operation.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Since there are no parentheses or exponents that need to be evaluated first, we perform the additions from left to right:

- First, we evaluate 6 # 6 = 2.
- Now, we have 8 # 2 = 2 and 2. Adding these results gives us 4.

Given expression: 4 # 3 + 2

First, we need to evaluate prime factor counting (F):

Since there are no negative numbers involved, we can directly apply prime factor counting to the absolute values of the given digits.

Given digits: |4| = 4 and |3| = 3

Prime factor counting (#) operation counts the number of unique prime factors shared by two given digits. In this case, prime factors of '4' are '2' and '2' and prime factors of '3' are '2' and '3'. Since both digits share one common prime factor '2', the prime factor counting result is: 1.

Now, we need to move forward to the next operation in the order: addition (A).

However, since there is a prime factor counting operation involved, we need to apply it before performing the addition operation.

Given the prime factor counting result (1), we can now move on to the addition operation.

Given expression: 1 + 2

Addition operation (A) : The sum of two given digits is 1 + 2 = 3.

Finally, since there is no multiplication or division operation involved, we don't need to apply any other operations as per the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC).

Wrapping up, we have Prime Factor Counting (F) = 1, Addition (A) = 3. Using the concatenation (C) operation as the last operation, we can now combine the results of both operations:

The answer is: 13."

5. Concatenation (C): There is concatenation in the form of '@' between 2 and 4.

With this in mind, we'll evaluate the expression step by step:

1. Evaluate addition: 5 + 2 = 7
2. Concatenation: We cannot concatenate 7 and 4 directly, since the order of operations states that we must evaluate concatenation after addition. Instead, we need to wait for the addition result (7) and concatenate it with 4.

Hence, the answer is 7@4 = 74."

Let's perform the prime factor counting for each term:

For the term 8 # 2:
- Testing for 8, prime factors are 2^3
- Testing for 2, prime factor is 2
- Since we only have 1 shared prime factor (2), the outcome will be 1

For the term 6 # 6:
- Testing for 6, prime factors are 2^2 * 3
- Testing for 6, prime factors are 2^2 * 2 * 3

Since we have more than one shared prime factor (we have three '2's in common), the outcome will be the number of shared prime factors, which is 2.

Now, since prime factor counting was performed before the addition, the final calculation is:

1 (from term 8 # 2) + 2 (from term 6 # 6) = 3

Therefore, the answer is 3."

First, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation (#): 
Since there's only one symbol, we directly apply the prime factor counting operation to 4 and 3. 
The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. There is no common prime factor, so the result of the prime factor counting operation is 0. 

Next, we evaluate the concatenation operation (@):
Since there is only one prime factor counting operation and we have reached the end of that step, we now perform the concatenation operation. 
Therefore, the concatenation of 4 and 3 is 43.

Lastly, we perform the addition operation (+):
We add the result of the concatenation operation (which is 43) and the given number 2.
The final answer is 45.

In this case, we have 3 and 2 as our operands. The prime factors of 3 are 3 and 3, while those of 2 are 2. Since there is only one shared prime factor, 3, the prime factor counting operation results in a count of 1.

Now, we move on to addition. With the result from the prime factor counting operation, the problem becomes 5 + 1. We simply add 1 to 5 to get 6.

Step 1: Parentheses
(14 + 4) = 18

Step 2: Exponents
None present, so we move on to the next operation.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting
We don't have absolute values, but it's important to note that for this operation, we must consider the absolute values of numbers. In this case, we're dealing with numbers that don't contain negative signs, so we can proceed with the next operation without worrying about taking absolute values.

None present, so we move on to the next operation.

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (left to right)
None present at this level, so we move on to the next operation.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
18 (the result of the parentheses operation) + 12 = 30

Step 6: Concatenation
30 @ 6 = 306

Step 7: Prime Factor Counting
We haven't taken the absolute values yet. Since '2' is the common prime factor in both |30| = 30 and |6| = 6, which is equal to 2, the answer is:

The answer is 1. (since the prime factor count is 1 between the positive numbers 30 and 6)

Step 8: Subtraction
306 - 2 = 304

So, the final solution is:
