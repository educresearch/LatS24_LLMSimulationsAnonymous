In this case, we have addition (+) and concatenation (@).

Given expression: 5 + 2 @ 4

According to the order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to perform prime factor counting (F) before addition (A) and before concatenation (C):

Since prime factor counting (F) of the numbers 5, 2, and 4 yield no shared prime factors, the prime factor counting operation results in 0 for each of them.

Now, we can perform the addition (A) operation:

5 + 0 = 5 (since 0 is the result of the prime factor counting operation)

Finally, we can perform the concatenation (C) operation with the result we got from the addition:

5 @ 4 = 54

So, the final answer is:

For the given expression: 8#2 + 6#6

Calculate the prime factor counting for each number:

- 2 = 2 (single prime factor, so its prime factor counting is 1) => 2F = 1
- 6 = 2^2 & 3^1 (prime factors of 6) => Prime Factor Counting for 6 is 2

1. Parentheses: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first:
    14 + 4 = 18
2. Prime Factor Counting: Since there is no operation between the numbers involved in this step, we evaluate the prime factor count between 6 and 18:
    The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
    The prime factors of 18 are 2, 2, 3, and 3.
    We have two 2's, two 3's as common prime factors, so the prime factor count is 4.
3. Multiply the results from steps 1 and 2:
    6 @ 18 = 618 (concatenating the digits of 6 and 18)
4. Subtract:
    12 - 2 = 10

Now, perform concatenation:

5. Concatenation: Since we have two results to concatenate, first, concatenate the results from step 3 and step 4:

                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.

                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)

                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Find the prime factor count shared by |5| and |3|, and |5| and |2|.Since the prime factors of 5 are 5, and the prime factors of 3 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 2 are 2, we have one shared prime factor 2 for 5 and 3, and no shared prime factor for 5 and 2. Therefore, the prime factor count for 5 and 3 is 1, and the prime factor count for 5 and 2 is 0.

2. Addition (S): Perform the addition operation. Since we calculated 5 + 3#2 as the sum of 5 and 3 with the result of 3#2, which is 1 (since there's one shared prime factor between 5 and 3), the sum of 5 and 1 is 6.

3. Concatenation (C): Since there's no operation inside the parentheses or involving exponents, we do not need to consider Parentheses (P), Exponents (E), or Multiplication/Division (M). Thus, we can directly perform the concatenation operation between |6| and |0| since 0 is the result of 5 and 2 having no shared prime factors. Hence, the concatenation of digits results in 60.

Therefore, the solution to the problem 5 + 3#2 is 60.

Since addition comes before concatenation, we first evaluate the addition part of the expression:

4 # 3 + 2 = 1 (from the key examples of prime factor counting, 3 has a prime factor of 3 which is not a shared prime factor with 4 and neither does it have with 2 hence the result is 0) + 2 = 2

Now we perform the concatenation part of the expression:

1 # 2 = 0 (from the key examples of prime factor counting, 1 has no prime factors, neither does 2, hence the result is 0)

So, 1 (from the first addition) @ 0 (from the concatenation) = 1 (as there's only a single digit left after performing the concatenation).

Given expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2

Step 1: Parentheses
Since there are parentheses, we need to evaluate what's inside first.

= 6 @ (18)

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting
As the next step is Prime Factor Counting (F), we need to find the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 18 and 6. In this case, the prime factors of 18 are 2, 2 and 3, and prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. So, there are 2 shared prime factors. However, since prime factor counting operation counts the number of occurrences of each prime factor, in our case, it is equivalent to multiplying the number of occurrences of each prime factor. So, the prime factor counting operation is equivalent to multiplying the prime factors.

= 2 * 2 * 3 = 12

So, 6 @ (18) = 6 @ 12 = 612

Step 3: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
As the next operation is Multiplication, we need to evaluate it.

= 612 + 12

= 624

So, 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 = 612 + 12 = 624.

systemPrompt3_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow the given hierarchy:

1. Parentheses: there are no parentheses in this expression, so we skip this step.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents, so we move on to the next operation.
3. Prime Factor Counting (#): We have the symbol #, so we should evaluate its operation before any others. In this case, the prime factors of 3 and 2 are both 2, which means there is a shared prime factor, so: 3 # 2 = 1.
4. Multiplication (x) and Division (/): Since we don't have any multiplication or division here, we continue to the next operation.
5. Addition (+) and Subtraction (-): There's an addition sign (+) between the numbers, so we evaluate it before the last operation (concatenation).
6. Concatenation (C): In this problem, there's no concatenation sign, so we don't have to evaluate this operation.

Given the order of operations, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting first, then addition. So the calculation would look like this:

3 # 2 = 1 (since there is a shared prime factor, 2)
5 + 1 = 6

Therefore, the answer to the problem is:

3. Prime Factor Counting (F): Concatenation (C) is next in the order, but since we cannot perform concatenation directly on numbers in this form, but rather on their absolute values, we must first evaluate the addition.

5 + 2 = 7 (Addition is done first in the order)

Since 7 is a positive number, we cannot perform any prime factor counting (F) or concatenation (C) at this point, as we need absolute values for those operations.

Now that we have the sum, we apply the prime factor counting (F) and concatenation (C) operations.

Since 7 is a prime number, its only prime factor is 7 itself. We do not have another number to share prime factors with, so the prime factor count (F) between 7 and 4 is 0.

Since the numbers have both been evaluated as absolute values, we can now perform the concatenation (C) operation.

7 @ 4 = 74

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Find the number of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of the numbers 4 and 3. Since prime factors for 4 are 2 and 2 and for 3 are 3. In this case, there is no shared prime factor, so the result is 0.
2. Concatenation (C): Perform the concatenation of the results from the previous step and the number 2. Since the number obtained from the previous step, 0, is concatenated with 2, the result is 2 (since a single digit is considered as a single digit number).

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this expression using the PEFMDASC order, let's go step by step:

1. Parentheses: We have parentheses first, so we evaluate the expression inside.
   = 14 + 4

2. Exponents: None present in the given expression.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F):
   We need to calculate the prime factor count between the absolute values of 6 and (14+4). First, let's calculate the sum 14+4:
   = 18
    Since prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and prime factors of 18 are 2, 2, and 3, the shared prime factors are 2 (twice). Here is a table to illustrate:

   | Prime factors of 6 | Prime factors of (18) | Shared prime factors |
   |--------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|
   | 2, 3               | 2, 2, 3                 | 2, 2                  |

   Since 2 appears twice in the shared prime factors, the prime factor count is 2.

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): None present in the given expression, so we skip this step.

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S):
   We have subtraction 12-2, which should be done before concatenation as per the PEFMDASC order. So, let's first subtract 2 from 12:
   = 10

6. Concatenation (C):
   Now we have two numbers, 6 and 10, which need to be concatenated:
   = 6 @ 10
   = 610 (Since we are concatenating the digits of |6| and |10|)

The final answer is 610."
