mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to identify which operations need to be done first. In this case, we have addition (A) and concatenation (C). According to the updated order of operations, concatenation (C)should be done last. So the correct sequence of operations is:

1. Addition (A)

Given: 5 + 2

So, we perform the addition operation first:

5 + 2 = 7

Now that we have the result of the addition, 7, we need to perform the concatenation operation (C). In this case, since there's only one number, 7, we simply concatenate it with itself, resulting in:

1. Concatenation (C)

7 @ 7 = 77

The final answer is 77.

Let's evaluate each term separately:

For 8#2:
The prime factors of |8| are 2 and 2.
The prime factors of |2| are 2.
Since there are 2 shared prime factors, the value of the prime factor counting operation between 8 and 2 is 2.

For 6#6:
The prime factors of |6| are 2 and 3.
The prime factors of |6| are 2 and 3. (twice)
Since there are 3 shared prime factors, the value of the prime factor counting operation between 6 and 6 is 3.

Now, we can evaluate the addition:
2 (from 8#2) + 3 (from 6#6) = 5

The answer is 5."

1. Prime factor counting (#), but there is no common factor between 4 and 3, so the result is 0.
2. Addition (+), so we add 3 and 2: 3 + 2 = 5.
3. Concatenation (@), but since we haven't encountered any numbers yet that go through the concatenation operation, let's leave it for now.

1. Parentheses: Solve the expression inside the parentheses first.
   The expression inside the parentheses is 14 + 4.

2. Prime Factor Counting: Since there are no numbers with negative signs involved, no prime factor counting is required in this step. So, the result moves to the next step.

3. Exponents: There are no exponents in the given expression. Thus, the result moves to the next step.

4. Multiplication and Division (L to R): None of the given operations are multiplication or division. Move to the next step.

5. Addition and Subtraction (L to R): Solve addition before subtraction.
   The expression 6@(14+4) translates to 6@(18) due to step 1.

6. Concatenation (L to R): Perform the concatenation operation.
   6@18 = 618

Now, move on to the remaining expression:

1, 2 - 3

Following the same order, there are no parentheses, so we move to the next step.

2. Prime Factor Counting: No negative signs, so no prime factor counting is needed.
3. Exponents: No exponents present.
4. Multiplication and Division (L to R): None of the given operations are multiplication or division. Move to the next step.
5. Addition and Subtraction (L to R): Subtraction is performed before addition.

In this case, the prime factors of 3 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 2 are just 2. Since 2 is a prime factor that is common to both numbers, we have a count of 1 for the prime factor counting operation, denoted as #.

Therefore, the expression 3 # 2 evaluates to 1.

Now, we move on to addition. Since there are no parentheses or exponents in the expression, we directly evaluate the addition sign.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve the given Mathematics problem using the newly introduced operations and the updated order of operations, we need to follow the given order: Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting (F), Multiplication and Division (M/D), Addition and Subtraction (A/S), and Concatenation (C).

Since there are no parentheses or exponents present in the given expression, we will proceed to prime factor counting (F).

(i) Prime Factor Counting (F):

First, let us find the prime factors of each number:

For 8: Prime factors are 2 and 2.

For 2: Prime factors are 2 and 2.

Since the same prime factor 2 is common in both numbers, the result of the prime factor counting is 2.

Now we have the result of prime factor counting, we move to Multiplication and Division (M/D).

(ii) Multiplication and Division (M/D):

As there is no multiplication or division present in the given expression, we proceed to the next operation, which is Addition and Subtraction (A/S).

(iii) Addition and Subtraction (A/S):

Since there are two addition operations, we do them one at a time from left to right:

8 # 2 = 1 (as determined in the prime factor counting)
6 # 6 = 3 (as determined in the prime factor counting)

So 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 3 = 4

Therefore, according to the updated order of operations, the answer is:

First, we have parentheses, but there are no parentheses in the expression, so we move on to the next operation.

Next is exponentiation, but there are no exponents, so we move on to the next operation.

We have prime factor counting represented as 4 # 3. Since prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and prime factors of 3 are 3, we don't have any shared prime factors, so the result of this operation is 0.

Now we have addition represented as 4 # 3 + 2. Since we need to evaluate prime factorization before addition, we first calculate 4 # 3 = 0. Therefore, the final answer is:

1. Parentheses: We have parentheses around the expression 14 + 4. We need to evaluate this expression first.

14 + 4 = 18

2. Exponents: We do not have any exponents in this problem.

3. Prime Factor Counting: We need to find the prime factor counts for 6 and 3, which are 2 and 2, respectively. Since they have 1 shared prime factor, the prime factor count of their concatenation, 6@3, is 1.

4. Multiplication and/or Division (left to right): We don't have any multiplication or division operations in this problem, so we move on to the next step.

5. Addition and/or Subtraction (left to right): We have two addition operations and one subtraction operation in our expression. We will perform them in the given order.

First, we perform 12 - 2 = 10
Then, we perform 6 @ 18 (concatenation): 6@1 = 6 and 6 @ 18 = 66. Since 6 and 18 share no prime factors, the prime factor count of their concatenation is 0. However, since the order of operations does not allow that result to stand, we must follow the order of operations and concatenate 6 and 18.

Now, we perform the addition: 66 + 10 = 76

Since there are no parentheses or exponents in the expression, we'll start with prime factor counting (F).

5 and 2 have no common prime factors, so their prime factor count is 0 according to the examples provided.

Next, we have addition (A) and subtraction (S). Since there's only addition in the expression, we'll evaluate it from left to right:

- The first addition is 5 + 0 (since the prime factor count of 5 is 0 and 0 is the identity for addition), resulting in 5.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations: PEF MDAS C. In this problem, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we start with Prime Factor Counting (F), Multiplication and Division (M/D), Addition and Subtraction (A/S), and finally Concatenation (C).

First, we evaluate Prime Factor Counting between the digits of 5 and 2, which results in 0 (since there are no common prime factors).

Next, we evaluate Addition and Subtraction:
5 + 2 = 7

Since there's no need for Concatenation in this problem, we will skip it. The answer is 7.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: The given expression is 8#2 + 6#6. According to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to follow the following sequence:

1. Prime Factor Counting (#)
2. Multiplication and Division (MD)
3. Addition and Subtraction (AS)
4. Concatenation (C)

First, let us calculate the prime factor counting (#) for both the numbers:

8 = 2³ × 2®
2 = 2®

So, 8 has prime factors 2³ and 2®.

6 = 2² × 3

So, 6 has prime factors 2² and 3.

Now, we need to find the unique prime factors that are common to both 8 and 6. Since there are no common prime factors, the prime factor counting (#) will be 0 for this expression.

Next, we have addition and subtraction (AS):

0 (prime factor counting) + 6#6  (as addition comes before concatenation)
= 6#6

Since multiplication comes before addition, we calculate 6#6:

6 = 2² × 3

Common prime factors: 2

The prime factor counting for both numbers is 2, so prime factor counting results in 1.

Therefore, the final answer is 1 + 6#6.

This completes the explanation of the solution for 8#2 + 6#6. However, since we don't know the value of 6#6, we cannot provide the exact result. Additionally, calculating the value of 6#6 would involve finding the prime factors of 6 and then counting the number of times they appear. In this case, 6 is already in its prime factor form, and we can see that the common prime factor between 8 and 6 is 2. So, prime factor counting results in 1.

Thus, the answer is 1 + 1 = 2. (This answer assumes the given prime factor counting value of 1 for 6#6.)

Keep in mind that the final answer may vary depending on the actual values of 6#6 since prime factor counting might lead to different outcomes. In this context, the example is used to demonstrate the given operations andorder."

2. Exponents: There are no exponents in the given expression. So we move on to the next operation.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): In the given expression, we have the symbol #, which represents Prime Factor Counting. So, we need to calculate the Prime Factor Counting first:
   Since the given expression is 4 # 3 + 2, we will calculate the prime factorization for 4 and 3 separately and then count the shared prime factors:
   Prime factors of 4: 2, 2
   Prime factors of 3: 3
   We have only one shared prime factor 2, so the prime factor counting is 1.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There are no multiplication or division operations in the given expression. So we move on to the next operation.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We have the symbol + which represents Addition. So, we need to calculate the addition before other operations:
   The expression is now 4 + 1 (since we performed prime factor counting before addition), and the result is 5.
6. Concatenation (C): We have the symbol @ which represents Concatenation, but there are no numbers for it to connect. Therefore, the concatenation is not applicable to this problem.

Based on the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, the solution to the given problem is:

4 # 3+2 = 1 (since we performed prime factor counting before addition) -> 5 (since we performed addition after prime factor counting)

2. Exponents: There are no exponents, so we proceed to the next operation.

3. Prime Factor Counting: Let's find the unique prime factors common to |6| and |18| as well as to |18| and |3|.

For 6 and 18, we have the prime factors 2, 2, 3, and 3 for 6 and 2, 2, 3, and 3 for 18. Two factors are common, so the prime factor counting (F) results in a value of 2.

4. Multiplication and Division (left to right): Multiply the results of the previous operation.

Since there is only prime factor counting in our current problem, this step is not needed. We'll move on to the next operation.

5. Addition and Subtraction (left to right): Add the numbers obtained from the previous operations and perform any necessary subtractions.

First, let's perform the addition: 6 @ (18) and 12. Since we have parentheses, we'll follow that first:
6 @ 18 = 618

Now we can perform the addition: 6 @ 18 + 12 = 618 + 12 = 629

However, we still need to perform the prime factor counting (F) between the numbers we've obtained (629 and 3). Since there are no common prime factors between 629 and 3, the prime factor counting result is 0.

6. Concatenation (left to right): Perform the concatenation of the numbers obtained in the previous step.
