mistral-7b-instruct,1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: According to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation before addition. However, in this given problem, there is no need for any exponent or multiplication/division operations, so we can directly proceed to prime factor counting and addition.

Given the expression 4 # 3 + 2, we need to find the unique prime factors shared between |4| and |3|, which are both 2, and the count of unique prime factors shared is 2.Then, we move on to addition.

Since we cannot perform prime factor counting on numbers 2 and 1 (as there are no shared prime factors), the result of the expression 4 # 3 is simply the prime factor counting operation result, which is 2.

Now, we perform the addition operation, 2 + 2, which equals 4.

The final answer is __.
Answer: 4.","GPT Response: To solve the given expression 4 # 3 + 2, we need to follow the newly updated order of operations PEFMDASC.

First, we perform prime factor counting (F) for 3 and 2. Since there is no shared prime factor, we get 0.

Next, we perform addition and subtraction (AS) inside the parentheses, 4 and 2. The answer is 6.

So now, we have 0 (from prime factor counting) # 6 (result of addition). Since there are no shared prime factors between 0 and 6, the answer is still 0.

Therefore, the answer is 0.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new mathematical operations and the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), follow these steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting (#): Find the unique prime factors common to |4| and |3|, which are both 2. So, 4 # 3 = 1.
2. Concatenation (C): Since 4 # 3 is 1, the concatenation of the results is simply the value of the last number, which is 3. So, 4 @ 3 = 3.
3. Addition (A): Add the results of prime factor counting and concatenation, which is 1 + 3 = 4.

Therefore, the answer is 4.","GPT Response: Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
First, we need to perform prime factor counting (F) for the given numbers 4 and 3, and then for the result and number 2.

For number 4, the prime factors are 2 and 2. So, 4 # 3 is 0, since there are no shared prime factors.

For number 3, the prime factors are 3.

Since we have 0 as the result from the first comparison, we don't proceed with the second comparison, keeping the result 0.

Step 2: Addition and Subtraction (AS)
Since there is an addition sign '+', we perform the Addition and Subtraction (AS) operation next.

To do this, we evaluate 3, then 2:

3
2

Adding these two numbers:

The answer is 5.

Since we got a result from the addition, we are now done with this expression:

4 # 3 + 2 = 0 (from the first step)

First, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F) (i.e., #), which is before addition (S):

1. Find the unique prime factors of each number:
   The prime factors of 5 are 5.
   The prime factors of 3 are 3.
   The prime factors of 2 are 2.

2. Calculate the number of shared prime factors between 3 and 2:
   Since there is only one shared prime factor 3 between 3 and 2, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 1.

Now, we can calculate the addition (A):

1. Add the numbers 5 and the result of the prime factor counting operation (1):
   The answer is 6.

So, the solution to the problem 5 + 3#2, based on the newly updated order of operations, is: The answer is 6.","GPT Response: Based on the newly updated order of operations, the solution to the problem 5 + 3#2 would be as follows:

Since prime factor counting (#) takes precedence over addition (+), we first calculate the prime factor counting of 3 and 2: 

3 : Prime factors are 3.
2 : Prime factors are 2.

Now we check if there is any shared prime factor between 3 and 2. The answer is ""yes,"" as they both share the prime factor ""2."" So, the prime factor counting is 1.

Since the prime factor counting is already calculated, the next operation to be carried out is addition (+).

So, the final calculation will be: 5 + 1 = 6.

Therefore, the answer is: The answer is 6.","GPT Response: First, let's perform the prime factor counting operation between the given numbers, 3 and 2. Since the prime factorization of 3 is 3 itself, and the prime factorization of 2 is 2, there is only one prime factor, 2, that is common to both numbers. So, 3 # 2 = 1.

Now, according to the updated order of operations, we need to do prime factor counting before addition. Therefore, the solution to the problem, 5 + 3#2, is:

5 + 1 = 6

So, the final answer is: The answer is 6.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 3#2 using the PEFMDASC order of operations, here are the steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting (3 and 2): Since prime factor counting comes before addition, we need to calculate the prime factor count of the numbers first.

For number 3, the prime factors are 3.
For number 2, the prime factors are 2.

Since there is only one shared prime factor (2), the prime factor count is 1.

2. Addition: After prime factor counting, we move on to the addition part of the expression.

Since we calculated the prime factor count before addition, we can now proceed with the addition operation.

First, we follow the revised order of operations PEFMDASC. In this case, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we move on to the next operations.

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Since both 5 and 4 are numbers, we cannot perform prime factor counting, so we move on to the next operation.

2. Concatenation (C): Since there's no other operation with a higher precedence, we perform concatenation. 
 So, 2 @ 4 = 24.

   We have 5 + 2. So, we need to perform this addition first, which results in 7.

2. Concatenation (C):
   Now we have 7 (the result of addition) and @ symbol. Since concatenation should be performed after addition according to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), the final step is to concatenate the digits of 7:

3. The answer is 7.

So, the solution to the problem 5+2 @ 4 is 7.

The answer is 7.

**Update**: We have been informed that the first step should actually be parentheses (P), as the concatenation symbol '@' binds more tightly than '+' sign. In that case, the problem would be solved with the following steps:

1. Parentheses (P):
   We have parentheses, but there's only one pair in the expression. Therefore, we don't need to do anything here since 5+2 comes before '@' symbol in the new order of operations (P-E-F-MD-ASC).

3. Prime factor counting: Calculate the prime factor count for 6 and 18 (which is the result of the parentheses):
   The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 18 are 2, 2, and 3. Since both numbers have 2 as a prime factor, the prime factor count is 1 (because only one 2 is being counted, not multiple instances of it).

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
   For the given expression 8#2 and 6#6, let's find the unique prime factors shared by these numbers.

   Prime factors of 8: 2, 2
   Prime factors of 2: 2, 2
   There is only one shared prime factor 2. So, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 2.

2. Addition (A):
   Now, we can perform the addition because concatenation comes last in the order of operations.
   The result of the first step (prime factor counting) is 2, so we just add the second number 6 to get the final answer.

The answer is: 8#2 + 6#6 = 8 (as prime factor counting) + 6 = 14.","GPT Response: To solve the given expression 8#2 + 6#6, we need to use the new order of operations PEFMDASC. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Prime factor counting (F): We first need to find the prime factor counts of 8 and 2, and 6 and 6.

   For 8 = 2³ × 2⁴, prime factors = { 2, 2, 2, 2 } = 4.
   For 2 = 2⁴, prime factors = { 2 } = 1.
   For 6 = 2² × 3², prime factors = { 2, 2, 3, 3 } = 4.
   For 6 = 6, prime factors = { 2, 3, 3 } = 3 (since 6 is already a prime number).

2. We have 1 shared prime factor between 8 and 2, which is 2. The prime factor count for 8 and 2 is 4 and 1, respectively. So 8#2 = 4.
Similarly, the prime factor count for 6 and 6 is 3 and 3, respectively. However, since there are no shared prime factors, the prime factor count operation gives 0.

3. Since the prime factor counting operation has higher precedence than addition according to the new order of operations, we get 0 + 6 = 6 as the sum of prime factor counts.

So, the given expression 8#2 + 6#6 evaluates to 0 (since the prime factor count operation for the second term is 0), and the final answer is:

The answer is 0.","GPT Response: To solve the problem 8#2 + 6#6 using the updated mathematical operations and order of operations, we first need to perform the prime factor counting (F) for each factor:

1. For 8: The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, so 8 has a prime factor count of 2.
2. For 2: Since 2 is already a prime number, it has a prime factor count of 1.
3. For 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, so 6 has a prime factor count of 2.

Now, we can perform the prime factor counting (F) operation: 2 (from 8) and 2 (from 6) share 2 prime factors, so the prime factor counting result is 2.

Next, according to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we should calculate the addition (A) operation before the concatenation (C) operation. In this case, since there are no multiplication or division operations involved, there's no need to follow a specific order aside from addition (A) before concatenation (C).

So, to calculate 8#2 + 6#6:

1. Perform Prime Factor Counting (F) operation: The result is 2.
2. Perform Addition (A) operation: 8 + 6 = 14.
3. Perform Concatenation (C) operation: Since there's only one digit for the result of the addition (A), there's no need for concatenation. The final answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the given order of operations PEFMDASC, follow these steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Identify the unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of the numbers:
   - For 8: Prime factors: 2, 2, 2
   - For 2: Prime factors: 2
   - Shared prime factors: 2
   - So, 8 # 2 = 1
   
2. Prime Factor Counting (F): Identify the unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of the numbers in the second expression:
   - For 6: Prime factors: 2, 3
   - For 6: Prime factors: 2, 2, 3
   - Shared prime factors: 2
   - So, 6 # 6 = 2

3. Addition (A): Add the results of the prime factor counting operations:
   - 1 + 2 = 3

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): Multiply the numbers that have the division sign between them (none):
   - There is no multiplication or division in this expression.

5. Exponents (E): Evaluate any exponentiation, if present (not applicable).

6. Multiplication and Division (M/D): Multiply the numbers that have the multiplication sign between them (none):
