llama-2-70b-chat,1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: Using the newly updated order of operations, PEFMDASC, we will evaluate the expression 4#3 + 2 as follows:

1. (F) Prime Factor Counting: 4#3 = 4#(12) = 4 + 1 + 2 = 7
2. (A) Addition: 7 + 2 = 9

The answer is 9.","GPT Response: Using the revised order of operations, PEFMDASC, we must first evaluate the prime factor counting (F) before moving on to addition (A/S).

4 # 3 = 1 (there is one shared prime factor, 3)

Next, we add 2 to the result:

1 + 2 = 3

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: The answer is 2.

Explanation:

In the expression 4#3 + 2, we need to follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): 4#3 = 4#(3) = 2 (since the common prime factors between 4 and 3 are 2)
2. Addition (A/S): 2 + 2 = 4

Therefore, the final answer is 4.","GPT Response: Sure! Let's work through the problem step by step, following the PEFMDASC order:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): 4 # 3 = 1 (since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3 and 1, and there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)
2. Addition (A): 1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3.
