llama-2-70b-chat,1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations:

1. Parentheses: inside the parentheses we have:

14 + 4 = 18

So, the expression becomes:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

1. Exponents (none in this case)
2. Prime Factor Counting:

2 # 3 = 1 (since 2 and 3 have a shared prime factor of 1)

So, the expression becomes:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right):

6 @ 18 = 108 (concatenation)

12 - 1 = 11

So, the expression becomes:

108 + 11

4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right):

108 + 11 = 119

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 119.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations: PEFMDASC.

6. Concatenation (left to right): none

Therefore, the answer is 120.

The answer is 120.","GPT Response: The given problem is:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:

14 + 4 = 18

Now, we can continue with the rest of the equation:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we need to evaluate the concatenation:

6 @ 18 = 6 @ 1800 = 10800

Now, we can evaluate the subtraction:
