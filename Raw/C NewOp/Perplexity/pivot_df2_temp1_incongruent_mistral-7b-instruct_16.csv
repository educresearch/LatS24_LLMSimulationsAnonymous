So, the solution would be:

5 + 2@4 = 5 + 24 = 29

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: To solve the given Mathematics problem with the newly introduced operations and updated order of operations, we need to follow the PEFMDASC rule:

1. Parentheses: We don't have any in this problem, so we'll move on to the next operation.
2. Exponents: We don't have any exponents in this problem, so we'll move on to the next operation.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): However, prime factor counting is not involved in this problem as there are no numbers given with negative signs or complicated absolute values. So, let's move on to the next operation.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): We don't have any multiplication or division sign in this problem, but we'll remember this step since it comes before addition and subtraction in the order of operations.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We have an operation @ which is defined as concatenation. In the given expression, 5 + 2@4, we have an addition operation and a concatenation operation. However, following the PEFMDASC order, we should perform the operation inside the parentheses (if any), exponents, primer factor counting, multiplication and division (from left to right), addition and subtraction (from left to right), and finally concatenation. But in our case, there are no parentheses, exponents, prime factor counting, or multiplication and division. So, the correct order of performing the operations here is addition and subtraction (from left to right), which means we should perform the addition operation before the concatenation operation.
6. Concatenation (C): Since we need to perform the addition operation before concatenation, we first add the numbers 5 and 2, which gives us 7. Now, we can perform the concatenation operation between the result (7) and the number 4. So, the final answer is 7@4.

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: To solve this problem with the newly introduced mathematical operations and the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow the steps given below:

3. Prime Factor Counting (F): This operation is not involved in the problem, so we move on to the next step.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): We see that the @ symbol represents concatenation, but the problem presents multiplication and division symbols instead. We make the substitution as follows: 2@4 is equivalent to 2 · 4 = 8. Therefore, the problem reduces to 5 + 8.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We perform this operation from left to right:
   First, we add 5 and 8, which results in 13.

None in this expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (#)
Since no absolute values or negatives are present, the prime factor counting operation does not apply.

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (MD)
In this expression, we do not have any multiplication or division operations.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (AS)
We have an expression 5 + 2@4. Here, 2@4 (concatenation) is an independent operation. Let's solve this step by step:
1. First, we need to follow the order of operations and solve the concatenation operation 2@4.
2. The concatenation operation combines the digits of the given numbers. So, here, we have the digits 2 and 4 joined together, resulting in 24.
3. Now, we come back to the adding operation. As the concatenation operation is completed, we replace the 2@4 with the result 24, and the expression becomes 5 + 24.

So, 6 # 18 = 1.

3. Concatenation (C): Concatenate '6' and the result of the parentheses expression:
   The result of the parentheses expression is '18'. So, 6 @ 18 = 618.

4. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S): Since there is an addition symbol (+) before concatenation symbol (@), perform addition first:
   618 + 12 = 630.

5. Subtraction (S): Now perform the subtraction, if any:

Next, calculate prime factor counting:

6 # 18

Prime factors of 6: 2, 3
Prime factors of 18: 2, 2, 3

Since no exponents are present, we move on to the next operation.

Step 3: Prime factor counting (#)
To find 2#3, we need to find the prime factors of the absolute values of 2 and 3, which are both 2 and 3 as 2 and 3 are the prime factors of 2 and 3 respectively. Since there's only one unique prime factor shared between them, the prime factor count is 1.

8 = 2³ * 2
2 = 2
6 = 2⁵

Since 8 and 2 do not share any prime factors, their prime factor counting operation will be 0. Similarly, 6 and 6 also do not share any prime factors, so their prime factor counting operation will be 0.

Step 2: Addition
Now, having the prime factor counting results, we can move on to the addition operation. Since we follow the left to right rule for the Addition and Subtraction (A/S), we'll perform the addition from left to right.

8 # (2 + 6)
