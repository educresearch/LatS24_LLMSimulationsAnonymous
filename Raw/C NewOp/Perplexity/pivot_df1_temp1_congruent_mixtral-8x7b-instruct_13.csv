mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F) before performing addition (A).

For 8#2, since the prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 2 are just 2, the shared prime factor is only 2. Therefore, 8#2 = 1.

Similarly, for 6#6, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and for 6, the prime factors are just 2, 3, and thus the shared prime factors are 2 and 3, so 6#6 = 2.

Now, we have 1 (from 8#2) + 2 (from 6#6), so we need to perform addition (A).

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC). According to this order, we need to perform prime factor counting (F) before addition (A). 

First, let's find the prime factors of 4 and 3. The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, the prime factor counting operation (4 # 3) will be 0.

Next, we perform addition (A) by adding 2 to the result of the prime factor counting operation (0), which gives us 0 + 2 = 2.

Therefore, the solution to 4 # 3+2 is 2.

The answer is 2."

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Let's solve the expression step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. The first operation in the order is Parentheses (P), but there are no parentheses in this expression, so we can move on to the next step.
2. The next operation is Exponents (E), but there are also no exponents in this expression, so we can move on to the next step.
3. The next operation is Prime Factor Counting (F). However, Prime Factor Counting (F) operates on pairs of numbers, and there is only one number involved in this step (2). Therefore, we can skip this step for now and move on to the next step.
4. The next operations are Multiplication and Division (M/D), but there are no multiplication or division operators in this expression. So we can move on to the next step.
5. The next operations are Addition and Subtraction (A/S). We have an addition operator (+) in this expression, so we perform the addition first.
6. Therefore, we add 5 + 2 to get 7.
7. Now, we move on to the Concatenation (C) operation. We have two numbers in the expression, 7 and 4. We concatenate these numbers by joining the digits together.
8. Therefore, we concatenate 7 and 4 to get 74.

The expression we need to simplify is: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
We start by performing the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation on both sides of the addition sign.

8 # 2 = 4 (since the unique prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and of 2 are just 2, so there is one shared prime factor 2)

6 # 6 = 2 (since the unique prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and of 6 are 2, 3, and 3, so there is one shared prime factor 2)
