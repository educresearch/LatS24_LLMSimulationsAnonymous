Prime Factor Counting (#): Perform the prime factor counting between the digits of the numbers on the right side of the operation (since # is before addition and subtraction in the order of operations):<br>   = 1 (since there is only one unique prime factor, 2, that appears in the absolute values of 6 and 18, and it appears only once in each number)<br><br>3.
