      <td>GPT Response: Let's go through the problem step by step using the new order of operations PEFMDASC:<br><br>1. Parentheses: Calculate 14 + 4, which equals 18.<br>2.

      <td>GPT Response: Let's break down the expression using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC):<br><br>1. Parentheses: Calculate the expression within the parentheses first (14 + 4)<br>2.

      <td>GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations, making sure to highlight the new operations and their placement.<br><br>1. First, perform the operation inside the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18. So the expression becomes 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3.<br>2. Next, we handle the new operation Concatenation (C). However, there are no matching integers for Concatenation, so we skip this step and proceed.<br>3. Now, we perform the Prime Factor Counting (F): 2 # 3 = 1, since the only shared prime factor between 2 and 3 is 1 (which is not considered a prime number). So the expression turns into 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1.<br>4. Next, handle the operation of Addition (A): 6 @ 18 + 11. Again, there are no matching integers for Concatenation, so we skip this step and proceed.<br>5. Perform the Concatenation (C): 1836 + 11. Results in 183611.<br>6. The final operation is Subtraction (S): 183611 - 1. The answer is 183610.<br><br>The answer is 183610.</td>

Prime Factor counting (F)<br>   For the first part, 8 # 2, calculate the unique prime factors of 8 and 2. The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, while the prime factor of 2 is 2 itself, so they share one prime factor, 2. Thus, 8 # 2 = 1.<br>   For the second part, 6 # 6, find the unique prime factors of 6 and 6. They are 2 and 3 for both, so we count two unique prime factors; that is, 6 # 6 = 2.<br><br>2.
