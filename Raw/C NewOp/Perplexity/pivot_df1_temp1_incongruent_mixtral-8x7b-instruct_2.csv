1. Parentheses: Calculate the expression within the parentheses first, 14 + 4 = 18.
2. Prime Factor Counting (F): We have 2#3, which calculates to 1 because the only prime factor shared between 2 and 3 is 1 (not a prime number), but concatenation (C) has higher precedence, so we continue to step 3 before resolving F.
3. Concatenation (C): Now calculate 6 @ 18, which results in 618.
4. Subtraction (S): Now perform the subtraction 12 - 1 (from step 2), which equals 11.
