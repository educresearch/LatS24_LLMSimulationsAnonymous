llama-2-70b-chat,1,700,systemPrompt3,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: The answer is 12.

Explanation:

8 # 2 = 4 (since the prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 1, and the prime factors of 2 are 2 and 1, so they share 2 as a common prime factor)

6 # 6 = 1 (since the prime factors of 6 are 2, 3, and 1, and there is only one shared prime factor between 6 and 6, which is 2)

Now, we add 4 and 1, which gives us 5.

llama-2-70b-chat,1,700,systemPrompt4,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: Sure! Let's evaluate the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the PEFMDASC order of operations.

Step 1: Evaluate the first operation, which is the prime factor counting (F).
8 # 2 = 8 # 2 = 0 (since there are no shared prime factors between 8 and 2)

Step 2: Evaluate the second operation, which is the prime factor counting (F).
6 # 6 = 6 # 6 = 1 (since there is only one shared prime factor, 3, between 6 and 6)

Step 3: Evaluate the addition (A/S) operation.
0 + 1 = 1

Step 4: Evaluate the concatenation (C) operation.
The result of the previous operation is 1, so we concatenate 8 and 1 to get 81.
