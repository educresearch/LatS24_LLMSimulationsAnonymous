Explanation:

In the expression 4#3 + 2, we need to follow the updated order of operations, PEFMDASC.

First, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) between 4 and 3, which gives us 1.

6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:

14+4 = 18

So, the problem becomes:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Next, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting:

2#3 = 1

6 @ 18 = 108

108 + 12 = 120

120 - 1 = 119

The answer is 119."
