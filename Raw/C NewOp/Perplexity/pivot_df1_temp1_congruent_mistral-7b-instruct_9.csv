mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem using the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to identify which operations are involved. In this case, we have addition (A), concatenation (C), and no parentheses or exponents.

Since addition is before concatenation in the order of operations, we should evaluate the addition first:

5 + 2 = 7

Now we have the result of the addition, which is a number (7). Concatenation is the last operation to be performed, so we concatenate the digits of the numbers obtained from the addition:

The answer is 7. (Note that no further concatenation is needed since only one number, 7, is involved in the problem.)"
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: The given expression is 8#2 + 6#6. According to the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to perform prime factor counting:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
   For 8 (|8| = 8), prime factors are 2, 2, 2, and 2 (2 ^ 3).
   For 2 (|2| = 2), the prime factor is 2.

   So 8 # 2 = 3 (the number of shared prime factors between 8 and 2, which is 2).

   For 6 (|6| = 6), prime factors are 2 and 3 (with count 2 for each, 2 ^ 2).

   So 6 # 6 = 2 (the number of shared prime factors between 6 and 6).

Now, we can perform the addition as the next step (since addition comes before concatenation):

2. Addition (A): 3 (the result of prime factor counting for the first term) + 2 (the result of prime factor counting for the second term) = 5.

So the answer is: The answer is 5."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression 4 # 3 + 2 according to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to perform the prime factor counting operation, then addition.

1. Prime factor counting:
The prime factors of 4 are 2 x 2.
The prime factors of 3 are 3.
Since there is no shared prime factor, the result of # operation is 0.

2. Addition:

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: Based on the new order of operations PEFMDASC, let's solve the given expression step by step:

1. Parentheses: 
   We have one pair of parentheses in the given expression, i.e., (14 + 4). Therefore, we will evaluate this expression first as per the new order of operations.

2. Inside the parentheses:
   We have addition inside the parentheses, i.e., 14 + 4. We will perform addition before any other operation as per the new order of operations.

3. Addition:
   We will add 14 and 4.

   = 18

4. Prime Factor Counting:
   Since we have only two numbers, i.e., 6 and 18, we will compute the count of unique prime factors shared by them using the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation.

5. Prime Factors of 6: 
   The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.

6. Prime Factors of 18:
   The prime factors of 18 are 2, 2, and 3. Since there are two 2's, we will count them separately.

7. Shared Prime Factors:
   We will count the number of shared prime factors between 6 and 18.

   = 1 (Only one instance of prime factor 2 is shared).

8. Order of Operations:
   Now that we have evaluated the expression inside the parentheses and computed the prime factor count, it's time to apply the other operations in the order specified by the new order of operations.

9. Multiplication and Division (MD):
   Concatenation operation comes before Multiplication and Division in the new order of operations, but there is no multiplication or division here, so we skip this step.

10. Addition and Subtraction (AS):
    Since there is only one addition and one subtraction here, we perform these operations in their given order from left to right.

    First, we will perform addition, i.e., 6 @ 18.

    = 65

    Now, we will perform subtraction, i.e., subtract 2 from 12.

    = 10

11. Concatenation (C):
    Finally, we will perform concatenation, i.e., 65 and 10.

    = 6510

The answer is 6510."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to perform the prime factor counting operation before addition.

Given expression: 5 + 3#2

Since prime factor counting operation comes before addition in the order of operations, we need to find the common prime factors between |5| and |3| and |2|.

The prime factors of 5 are 5, since it is a prime number.
The prime factors of 3 are 3, since it is a prime number.
The prime factors of 2 are 2.

Since there is only one common prime factor between 5 and 3 (none with 2), the prime factor counting operation results in 0.

Now we can perform the addition operation with the result of the prime factor counting operation.

So, the final answer is:

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem utilizing the newly introduced mathematical operations and the revised order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow the rules as follows:

1. Parentheses: No parentheses present.
2. Exponents: No exponents present.
3. Prime factor counting (F):
   In this step, we find the prime factor count for each number separately:
   a) 8 # 2 = 2 (since prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2, and 2; we have two '2' in common).
   b) 6 # 6 = 2 (since prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and we have two '2' in common).

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D):
   We don't have any multiplication or division in this expression. So we move to the next step.

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S):
   In this step, we add the prime factor counts:
   a) 8 # 2 = 2
   b) 6 # 6 = 2
   c) 2 (from step 3a) + 2 (from step 3b) = 4

6. Concatenation (C):
   Since we don't have any numbers in original form to concatenate, we'll move to the next and final step.

The answer is: 

The answer is 4.

We cannot provide an answer with the symbol '@' since the instruction did not ask for a concatenated result. Instead, we can only provide the prime factor counts summation answer."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression 4 # 3 + 2 according to the revised order of operations PEFMDASC, we first evaluate the prime factor counting operation between 3 and 2, which results in 0 as there are no shared prime factors. Then we perform the addition operation before the concatenation operation, which gives us the result as 1 (3 + 2). Finally, since the concatenation operation comes last in the order of operations, we concatenate the digits of the result 1 and 4. Therefore,

The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the newly introduced mathematical operations and updated order of operations, follow the steps below:

1. Parentheses: Solve the expression inside the parentheses first, i.e., 14 + 4:
   = 18

2. Prime Factor Counting (#): Perform the prime factor counting between the digits of the numbers on the right side of the operation (since # is before addition and subtraction in the order of operations):
   = 1 (since there is only one unique prime factor, 2, that appears in the absolute values of 6 and 18, and it appears only once in each number)

3. Multiplication and Division (M/D): Since there is no multiplication or division symbol in the given expression, we can skip this step.

4. Concatenation (C): Carry out the concatenation between the digits of the numbers obtained in step 1:
   = 6 @ 18

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Perform addition and subtraction from left to right:
   = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2
   = 6 @ (18 + 12 - 2)
   = 6 @ (20 - 2)
   = 6 @ 18

6. Finally, perform the concatenation:
   = 114 (We have 1 as a leading digit because of the concatenation of 6 and 18.)

So, the answer is 114."

In the given expression, 3#2, the prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since there is only one shared prime factor, 2, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 1.

Now, we perform the addition operation: 5 + 1 = 6.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the problem with the new mathematical operations and order of operations, we need to follow the PEFMDASC rule. In this given expression, the symbol "">@<"" represents concatenation, and the ""+"" symbol represents addition.

According to the order of operations, we need to first evaluate additions and subtractions inside parentheses, then exponents, prime factor counting, multiplication and division, and lastly concatenation.

Since we don't have any addition inside parentheses, we can skip the first P (Parentheses) step.

Now, let's evaluate the additions in the expression. There is only one addition, ""+"", so we apply the A/S rule (Addition and Subtraction).

Our problem: 5 + 2 > 4

With the new order of operations: PEFMDASC, conceptually we have:

1. Concatenation (C) doesn't apply since there are no @ symbol present in the problem.
2. Prime Factor Counting (F) doesn't apply since there are no # symbol present in the problem.
3. Exponents (E) don't apply since there are no exponents in the expression.
4. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Perform the addition (5 + 2), which equals 7.
5. Multiplication and Division (M/D): We don't have any multiplication or division symbols in the problem, so we can skip this step.
6. Concatenation (C) still doesn't apply, so we can move on to the final step.

The answer is: The answer is 7."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression with the new mathematical operations and the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), first, we need to apply prime factor counting (F) to find the unique prime factors common to |8| and |2| and |6| and |6|:

(1) Prime Factor Counting: 8 # 2 = 2 and 6 # 6 = 2. Since both a and b have the same prime factor 2, the result will be 2 (according to the examples, since there is only 1 shared prime factor 2).

Next, we'll apply addition (A) since it has a lower precedence than prime factor counting (F):

(2) Addition: 2 + 6 = 8.

So, the final step is to concatenate (C) the result obtained in the previous step:

(3) Concatenation: 8.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations, which is PEFMDASC. In this case, prime factor counting (F) comes before addition and concatenation (A/S and C), so we need to find the prime factors of each number and count the shared prime factors before performing addition and concatenation.

Given: 4 and 3

To find the prime factors of each number:

1. Find the prime factors of 4: 2 x 2 x 2 = 8
2. Find the prime factors of 3: 3

Now, find the number of shared prime factors: Since 8 and 3 do not have any common prime factors, the prime factor counting operation (#) results in 0.

Next, follow the order and perform the addition and concatenation:

Since we've already done prime factor counting, we now perform addition: 0 + 3 = 3

Since we haven't performed concatenation yet, perform that next: Place the digits of 4 and 3 next to each other: 4 _ 3

Since there is no concatenation symbol, we assume it is left to right, resulting in 43.

1. Parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18

Now we have 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2. Since multiplication and division come before concatenation, we will evaluate 12 - 2 first to get 10.

So, the problem now is 6 @ 18 + 10. Here we can now apply concatenation:

6 @ 18 = 186

Finally, we add the results we have obtained so far:

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 5 + 3#2, according to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we should first focus on prime factor counting (F). Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. Evaluate prime factor counting (3#2):
Since 3's prime factors are just 3, and 2's prime factors are 2, there's no shared prime factor in the pair 3 and 2. So, prime factor counting (F) will result in 0.

2. Move on to addition (A):

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the given order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to identify which operation to perform based on the order of precedence:

1. Parentheses: None
2. Exponents: None
3. Prime Factor Counting:  Both sides of the expression have the # sign. We will perform Prime Factor Counting (F) operation for each side separately and keep that in mind for the later steps.
   a) For 8 # 2: Prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2, and 2, i.e., four 2s. Prime factors of 2 are all 2, so the number of unique shared prime factors between 8 and 2 is 1.
   b) For 6 # 6: Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Prime factors of 6 itself are repeated; however, since prime factor counting determines the _number_ of shared prime factors, we have 2 shared prime factors here.

Now, we have the information of shared prime factors for each side. Let's proceed with the actual calculations following the order of operations:

1. Prime Factor counting (F): Done
2. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There is no multiplication or division.
3. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We need to add 8 # 2 and 6 # 6. Since we determined that there is one shared prime factor between 8 and 2 and 2 shared prime factors between 6 and 6, we can now add the results of the Prime Factor Counting operations for each side.

   4 has prime factors 2 and 2.
   3 has prime factors 3.

2. Addition (A): Perform the addition operation: 0 + 2 = 2.

3. Concatenation (C): Since concatenation has a lower precedence than addition, perform the concatenation: 2 @ 3 = 23.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F): Calculate the count of shared unique prime factors between |6| and |18| and between |6| and |3|.
   a) 6 # 18 = 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and prime factors of 18 are 2, 2, and 3. 2 and 3 are shared prime factors, so F(6, 18) = 2.
   b) 6 # 3 = 0: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and prime factors of 3 are only 3. Since there are no common prime factors, F(6, 3) = 0.

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): Perform multiplication and division from left to right
   We don't have any multiplication or division signs in the expression.

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Perform addition and subtraction from left to right
   a) Solve 6@(18 + 4) (Note that we combine it with the previous result as none of the operations we have encountered so far take precedence over the concatenation)
     = 6@22
     = 622

   b) Solve 622 + 12 - 2

Step 2: Perform the addition (A):
Now, we complete the addition with the result from the previous step:
5 + 3 = 8
