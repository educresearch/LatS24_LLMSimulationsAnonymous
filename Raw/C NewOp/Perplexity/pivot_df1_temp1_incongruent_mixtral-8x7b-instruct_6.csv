mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8 # 2+6 # 6,GPT Response: For the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: Following the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first evaluate the prime factor counting operation. The prime factors of 4 are 2 and the prime factors of 3 are 3, so they don't have any shared prime factors, thus 4 # 3 equals 0.

So, the expression becomes:

0 + 2

Now, we follow the order and perform addition, which gives us:

The answer is 2."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Let's go through the given expression and solve it step by step, following the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

First, perform the operation inside the parentheses:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, calculate the prime factor counting operation:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 3 # 2, we need to follow the new order of operations PEFMDASC.

First, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation, which is the third operation in the order. However, in this case, there is no prime factor counting operation to perform, as there are no absolute values involved in the expression.

Therefore, we move on to the next operation in the order, which is addition, the fifth operation in the order. We add 5 and 3 to get 8.

So, the answer is 8."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 2@4, we need to follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC). According to this order, concatenation (C) should be done after addition (A). So, we first evaluate 2@4 which gives us 24 (since the absolute values of 2 and 4 are 2 and 4, and the concatenation of 2 and 4 is 24).

Then, we perform the addition and get 5 + 24 = 29.

Therefore, the answer is 29."

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Let's go step by step according to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. Parentheses: Calculate the expression inside the parentheses first: 14 + 4 = 18
2. Concatenation (C): Now, perform the concatenation operation: 6 @ 18 = 618
3. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Then, perform addition and subtraction from left to right: 618 + 12 = 630
4. Prime Factor Counting (F): Next, do the prime factor counting: 2 # 3 = 1 (since 2 and 3 have only one shared prime factor, which is 2)
5. Subtraction (S): Finally, perform the remaining subtraction operation: 630 - 1 = 629

The answer is 629."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations, we first evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F) inside the parentheses:

5 + 1 (since the prime factors of 2 are 2 and 1 is the count of unique prime factors shared by 2 and 3)

Next, we perform the addition operation (A):

5 + 1 = 6

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 6."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), which means we should perform the addition and concatenation from left to right, but only after handling any parentheses, exponents, prime factor counting, and multiplication or division.

In this case, there are no parentheses, exponents, prime factor counting, or multiplication/division, so we just need to follow the order of addition and concatenation (A/S and C).

So, to solve the problem:

5 + 2@4

First, we evaluate the concatenation:

2@4 = |2|@|4| = 2@4 = 24

Next, we perform the addition:

5 + 24 = 29

The answer is 29."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: For the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6, we need to follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, which includes Prime Factor Counting (F) before Addition and Subtraction (A/S). So, we first calculate the Prime Factor Counting operations:

8 # 2 = 2 (since 8 has prime factors 2, 2, 2 and 2 has prime factor 2, there is 1 shared prime factor)

6 # 6 = 1 (since 6 has prime factors 2, 3 and 6 has prime factors 2, 3, no shared prime factors)

Then, the expression becomes:

2 + 1

And finally, perform the Addition operation:

The answer is 3."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC).

First, we perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation:

4 # 3 = 1 (since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3, so there is no shared prime factor.)

Next, we perform the Addition (A) operation:

1 + 2 = 3

So,

The answer is 3."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: First, according to the new order of operations, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:

14 + 4 = 18

Next, we perform concatenation:

6 @ 18 = 618

Now, we have:

618 + 12 - 2#3

We perform addition and subtraction from left to right:

618 + 12 = 630

2#3 = 0 (since prime factors of 2 are 2 and prime factors of 3 are 3, there is no shared prime factor)

Finally, subtract 0 from 630:

The answer is 630."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: First, according to the new order of operations, we need to perform Prime Factor Counting (F) before Addition (A).

5 + 3 # 2
= 5 + 0 (since the only prime factor of 2 is 2, and 2 is not a factor of 3)
= 5

So,

The answer is 5."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: Let's solve the problem using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. There are no Parentheses, Exponents, nor Prime Factor Counting (F) in this expression, so we move on to Multiplication and Division (M/D). However, there are no multiplication or division operations in this expression.
2. Next is Addition and Subtraction (A/S). Here, we have the addition operation: 5 + 2@4
3. Before performing the addition, we need to calculate the Concatenation (C). The expression 2@4 means to concatenate the digits of 2 and 4 and results in 24.
4. Now replace 2@4 with the result of the Concatenation: 5 + 24
5. Finally, perform the Addition (A). The answer is 29.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. First, perform the operation inside the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18
2. Next, use the newly calculated value to perform the Concatenation operation with 6: 6 @ 18 = 618
3. Now, perform the Subtraction operation: 618 + 12 = 630
4. Lastly, perform the Prime Factor Counting operation with 2 and 3 (which is 1 since they share a single prime factor of 2) and subtract that value from the previous result: 630 - 1 = 629

The answer is 629."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: Let's calculate the expression step by step, following the PEFMDASC order:

1. There are no parentheses or exponents in the expression, so we move on to Prime Factor counting (F). However, there is no Prime Factor counting involved in this expression.
2. The next operations are Multiplication and Division (M/D), but there are no multiplication or division in the expression.
3. The next operations are Addition and Subtraction (A/S). Addition is present in our expression.

So, the first step is simply 5 + 3, which equals 8.
Now, we have a Prime Factor counting step:

1. The expression now is 8 # 2. The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and there are no prime factors of 2. Hence, there are no shared prime factors to count.

Therefore,

The answer is 0."
