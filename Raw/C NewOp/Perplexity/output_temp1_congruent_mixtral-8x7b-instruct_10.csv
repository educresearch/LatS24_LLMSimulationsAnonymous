1. Parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18
2. Exponents: There are no exponents in the expression.
3. Prime Factor counting: We'll perform this operation when we have two numbers to compare.

Now, we evaluate the expression from left to right, taking into account the previous steps:

6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 (concatenation, multiplication, subtraction; from left to right)

Perform the concatenation:

618 + 12 - 2

Then, the subtraction:

618 + 10

Since there are no more multiplication, division, addition, or subtraction operations, we perform the prime factor counting operation:

618 # 10 = 0, since there are no shared prime factors between them.

The answer is 628."

                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)

                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

systemPrompt3_userPrompt2_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: For the expression 8#2 + 6#6, we need to follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC. In this case, there are no Parentheses (P), Exponents (E), or Multiplication/Division (M/D), so we proceed directly to Prime Factor Counting (F).

First, calculate 8#2:

8 has prime factors of 2*2*2
2 has prime factors of 2

Shared prime factors between 8 and 2: 2
So, 8#2 = 1

Next, calculate 6#6:

6 has prime factors of 2*3
6 has the same prime factors of 2*3

Shared prime factors between 6 and 6: 2, 3
Since we need to count unique prime factors, 2 and 3 are separate factors. So, 6#6 = 2

Finally, when combining the Prime Factor Counting (F) results with Addition (A), the expression becomes:

1 + 2

The answer is 3."

1. Consider the expression: 5 + 2 @ 4
2. Since there are no parentheses or exponents, we proceed to the next operation in the order, which is Prime Factor Counting (F). However, in this case, there is no need for prime factor counting since neither 5 nor 2 contains any shared prime factors with 4. So, we move on to the next operation.
3. The next operation is Multiplication and Division (M/D), but there are no multiplication or division operations in the expression. So, we move on to the next operation.
4. The next operation is Addition and Subtraction (A/S). Now, we have 5 + 2. Perform the addition: 5 + 2 = 7.

4 # 3 + 2

First, we calculate the prime factor counting (F) of 4 and 3.

Prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, hence only one unique prime factor 2.
Prime factors of 3 are 3, hence no unique prime factors shared with 4.
Therefore, 4 # 3 = 1.

Now the expression becomes:

1 + 2

Next, we perform addition (A) since no other operations of higher precedence remain.

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.
