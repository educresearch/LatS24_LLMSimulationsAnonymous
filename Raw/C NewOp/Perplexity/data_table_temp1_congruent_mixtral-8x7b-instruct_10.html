      <td>GPT Response: Let's solve this problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations, focusing on the new operations and their placement:<br><br>1. Consider the expression: 5 + 2 @ 4<br>2. Since there are no parentheses or exponents, we proceed to the next operation in the order, which is Prime Factor Counting (F). However, in this case, there is no need for prime factor counting since neither 5 nor 2 contains any shared prime factors with 4. So, we move on to the next operation.<br>3. The next operation is Multiplication and Division (M/D), but there are no multiplication or division operations in the expression. So, we move on to the next operation.<br>4. The next operation is Addition and Subtraction (A/S). Now, we have 5 + 2. Perform the addition: 5 + 2 = 7.<br>5. We are left with the expression: 7 @ 4<br>6. Since Concatenation (C) is the next operation in the order, and it is not inside any parentheses, perform the concatenation operation: 7 @ 4 = 74<br><br>The answer is 74.</td>
