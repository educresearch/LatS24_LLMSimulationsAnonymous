mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we start by performing the concatenation operation since it comes after addition in the order.

5 + 2@4
= 5 + 24 (since 2@4 = 24)

Now that we have evaluated the concatenation, we are left with a simple addition.

5 + 24 = 29

Therefore, the answer is 29.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to perform the concatenation operation before the addition.

Therefore, the answer is 29.","GPT Response: First, we need to evaluate the concatenation operation before addition according to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC). The number 2 concatenated with 4 is 24. Then, we add this result to 5.

The answer is 5 + 24 = 29.","GPT Response: Let's solve this problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. Since there are no parentheses or exponents, we proceed to prime factor counting (F). However, in this expression, there is no need to perform prime factor counting because there are no multiplication, division, absolute value, or numbers to which we can apply this operation.
2. Next, we evaluate the concatenation (C). The number 2 is concatenated to the result of 4 @ 5 (in that order, because according to the order of operations, concatenation is last to be evaluated):
   4 @ 5 = 45 (since the digits of both numbers are 4 and 5)
   2 @ 45 = 245 (result of the concatenation)
3. Now, we evaluate the addition (A). We add 5 to the result of the above step:
   5 + 245 = 250

The answer is 250."

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Let's go through the problem step by step, following the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Parentheses: Calculate the expression inside the parentheses first.
  14 + 4 = 18

2. Prime Factor counting (F): 
  Since there are no negative numbers left, we can proceed with the calculation.
  There are no shared prime factors between 6 and 18, so 6 # 18 = 0.

3. Concatenation (C):
  Now, we can proceed with concatenation.
  6 @ 18 = 618

4. Addition and Subtraction (A and S):
  There are addition and subtraction operations left. We calculate them from left to right.
  618 + 12 = 630
  630 - 2 = 628

Now we can see that there are no more operations left. So:

The answer is 628.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC).

First, calculate the expression in the parentheses:

6 @ (14 + 4) = 6 @ 18

Then, perform the concatenation operation:

6 @ 18 = 618

Now, calculate the expression in the second set of parentheses:

2 # 3 = 0 (since 2 and 3 don't have any common prime factors)

Finally, perform subtraction:

618 + 12 = 630

So, the answer is 630.

The answer is 630.","GPT Response: To solve the expression using the new order of operations PEFMDASC, first, we need to solve the operation inside the parentheses:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2#3
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Next, calculate the prime factor counting (F) since it comes before addition (A):

18 # 2 = 0 (since 18 has prime factors 2 and 3, and 2 has a prime factor 2. There are no common prime factors between them, therefore, 0.)

Now, we do the addition (A):

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Then, concatenation (C):

618 + 12 - 0

Now, perform subtraction (S):

618 + 12 - 0 = 630

Finally, there are no more operations left.

The answer is 630.","GPT Response: Step 1: According to the order of operations, we first evaluate the expression in parentheses. 

14 + 4 = 18

So, the expression becomes:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Next, we perform the Concatenation operation (C). 

6 @ 18 = 618

So, the expression becomes:

618 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 3: Then, we perform the Prime Factor Counting operation (F).

2 # 3 = 1 (since the only prime factor of 2 is 2 and of 3 is 3, and they don't have any common prime factors)

So, the expression becomes:

618 + 12 - 1

Step 4: Next, we perform Addition and Subtraction (A/S) from left to right.

618 + 12 = 630
