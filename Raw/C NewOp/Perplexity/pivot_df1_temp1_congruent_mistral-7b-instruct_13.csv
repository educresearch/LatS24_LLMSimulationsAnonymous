mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem with the new operations and order of operations, we need to follow the expanded PEMDAS rule, which is now PEFMDASC.

Given expression: 5 + 2 @ 4

First, we need to evaluate the concatenation operation since it is the last operation in the expanded PEMDAS rule.

2 @ 4 = 24 (concatenating the digits of 2 and 4)

Now, we need to evaluate the addition operation since it is the second last operation in the expanded PEMDAS rule.

5 + 24 = 29

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 29."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: The solution to this problem following the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC) would be as follows:

1. Prime factor counting (F): We first calculate the prime factor counts for each number:
   - 8: 2 # 2 # 2 # 1 = 3
   - 2: 2 # 1 = 1

2. Addition (A): Now, we perform the addition as per the updated order of operations:
   - 3 (from step 1 for 8) + 1 (from step 1 for 2) = 4

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 4."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: According to the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation. In this case, the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 and 2 are 2 and 2, respectively. Since there are no unique shared prime factors, the prime factor counting operation results in 0.

However, in the given expression, 4 # 3+2, there seems to be a mistake since the prime factor counting operation can only be applied to the absolute values of two integers. In the current context, it doesn't make sense to perform prime factor counting on the sum of an integer and a binary operation result. Therefore, the given expression cannot be solved with the new defined operations and order of operations as presented.

Hence, we cannot provide a solution or final answer to the given Mathematics problem in the given context. We encourage checking the problem statement for any potential errors or missing information, or consult the source to ensure the applicability of the newly introduced operations and order of operations."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the expanded order of operations (PEFMDASC), first, we will deal with the operation inside the parentheses:

1. Calculate the expression inside the parentheses, following the standard order of operations (PEMDAS):
   = 14 + 4
   = 18

Next, we will perform concatenation:

2. Concatenate 6 and the result from the previous step:
   = 6 @ 18
   = 618

Now, we will perform prime factor counting:

3. Find prime factors common to the absolute values of the operands in the last operation, i.e., 6 and 18. Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3; prime factors of 18 are 2 and 3. Since we have 2 common, the prime factor counting operation results in 2.

Finally, we will perform addition and subtraction:

4. Add the result from the concatenation and the result from prime factor counting:
   = 618 + 2
   = 620

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 620."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: Based on the new order of operations, we first evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F) between the numbers 3 and 2. Since prime factors of number 2 are 2 itself and there are no common prime factors between 3 and 2, the result is 0.

Next, we perform the addition operation (A) between the numbers 5 and the result of the prime factor counting operation 0, which simply equals 5.

The answer is 5."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematical expression with the new operations and order of operations:

1. Evaluate prime factor counting (F) first: Since both the numbers 5 and 2 are positive, we have 5 # 2 = 1.

2. Perform addition (A) and subtraction (S) (left to right): Since there is only addition in the expression, we perform it directly:

3. Concatenation (C): Since we have reached the last operation to be performed in the order of operations, we perform concatenation:

Therefore, the final answer is: The answer is 51 (from 5 + 1, and then 1 @ 4 = 14, and finally the concatenation of 5 and 14)."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem based on the new mathematical operations and updated order of operations, follow the given steps:

1. Perform prime factor counting (F) for each number:
   For 8: 2³ × 2
   For 2: 2

2. Calculate the prime factor counting (F) of the given expression:
   Since we are comparing two numbers, we need to find their prime factors separately and then check the shared prime factors.
   In this case, prime factor counting of 8 = 1 (3 unique prime factors: 2³, and 2) and prime factor counting of 2 = 1 (1 unique prime factor: 2).
   Since there is only one shared prime factor, the prime factor counting (F) of the given expression, 8#2, is 1.

3. Perform prime factor counting (F) for the remaining expression:
   For 6: 2³ × 3

4. Calculate the prime factor counting (F) of 6#6:
   For 6: 2³ × 3
   For 6: 2³ × 3
   There are 2 unique prime factors (2³) shared between the two terms, so the prime factor counting (F) of 6#6 is 2.

5. Since prime factor counting (F) has higher precedence than addition (+), we need to calculate the prime factor counting (F) of the given expression first: The answer is 1.

So, the final answer is 1."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression 4 # 3 + 2 following the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to identify which operation to perform next based on the order.

Since there are no parentheses, we evaluate sets of operations in the following order:
- Prime Factor Counting (F)
- Exponents (E)
- Multiplication and Division (M/D)
- Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
- Concatenation (C)

In the given expression 4 # 3 + 2, there are no exponent or prime factor counting operations, and there is no need for parentheses.

Thus, we start evaluating addition and subtraction (A/S), which comes third in the new order of operations. So we evaluate 3+2 = 5. Now we have 4 # 5.

Next is concatenation (C), which comes last in the new order of operations. So, we perform the concatenation operation on the given digits, i.e., 4 and 5.

Hence, the answer is 45.

The answer is 45."

1. First, we apply the parentheses:
   = 6 @ (14 + 4)

2. Next, we perform the addition inside the parentheses:
   = 6 @ (18)

3. Now, we apply the concatenation operation:
   = 6 @ 18

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: According to the revised order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to evaluate prime factor counting before addition. In this given problem, 3 shares no prime factors with 2 (the prime factors of 3 are 3 and 3, and the prime factors of 2 are 2), so their prime factor counting operation results in 0. thus, the final answer is:

The answer is 5."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem with the new operations and order, we need to follow the updated order of operations: PEFMDASC. Since there are no parentheses or exponents involved, we can skip those steps.

The problem is 5 + 2 @ 4.

1. Addition (A): Calculate 5 + 2 = 7.
2. Concatenation (C): Since we need to perform concatenation before addition, but there is no overlap between the operands of the addition and the concatenation signs, we can perform them separately without influencing the result. So, 7 @ 4 = 74.

The answer is 74."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated mathematical operations and the given order of operations PEFMDASC, we first perform the prime factor counting (F) for both numbers 8 and 6.

The prime factorization of 8: 2³ x 2⁴
The prime factorization of 6: 2² x 3²

Since there's no common prime factor in their prime factorizations (shared prime factors are 2³, 2⁴, and 3²), prime factor counting results in 0. We continue to the next operation, which is addition (A/S).

So, 8#2 + 6#6 = 0 + 6#6

Now we perform concatenation (C) on the last term 6#6.
Since 6 is a positive number:
1#6 = 0 because there's no common prime factor (no shared prime factors between 1 and 6).
So 6#6 = 6#(6#1) = 6#0 = 6

Therefore, the answer is 0 + 6 = 6."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 4 # 3 + 2, we need to follow the updated order of operations: PEFMDASC. This means we first need to perform prime factor counting (F) and then addition (A).

Prime factor counting (F):
We find the unique prime factors common to |4| and |3|: 2 and 2, respectively. Therefore, 4 # 3 = 1.

Now we can perform the addition (A):
1 + 2 = 3

1. Parentheses: First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18.
2. Concatenation: Now, perform the concatenation operation between the result (18) and the number (6): 18 @ 6 = 186.
3. Prime Factor Counting: Since this operation involves only single digits, there are no shared prime factors. Therefore, the prime factor counting operation (#) between 3 and 2 results in 0.
4. Subtraction: Perform subtraction before addition and concatenation: 12 - 2 = 10.
5. Addition: Finally, perform the addition and concatenation: 186 + 10 = 196.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 5 + 3#2 using the newly introduced operations and order of operations, we first need to identify which operations need to be performed first based on the PEFMDASC order.

Given expression: 5 + 3#2

Since prime factor counting (#) has a higher precedence than addition (+), we need to calculate the prime factor counting first:

3#2 = 0 (since the prime factors of 3 are 3 and those of 2 are 2, and there are no shared prime factors between them)

Now that we have the result of the prime factor counting operation, we can perform the addition:

Answer: 5."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 2 @ 4 using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow these steps:

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in this expression, so we skip this step.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents, so we skip this step.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We cannot apply this operation directly to this expression, as it involves concatenation (C) and addition (+). Prime Factor Counting (F) comes before Addition and Subtraction (AS), so we move on to the next step.
4. Multiplication and Division (MD): There is no multiplication or division in this expression, so we skip this step.
5. Addition and Subtraction (AS): In this step, we perform the addition operation (+). We cannot perform concatenation (@) inside the addition operation. So, we first evaluate the addition part.

5 + 2 = 7 (The addition part evaluates to 7)

6. Concatenation (C): In this step, we perform the Concatenation operation (C) since it comes after Addition and Subtraction (AS) in the updated order of operations.

Since we have the result 7, we cannot concatenate it with anything in this expression, so the concatenation part is not relevant in this case. However, if we had an expression like 5 + 2 @ 4 or 5 @ (2 + 4), we would need to solve these parts separately before concatenating.

Final answer: szThere is no final answer in this expression as concatenation is not applied. Instead, this expression could be part of a larger expression that would be solved eventually using the PEFMDASC order.

Instead, the focus should be on understanding how to properly apply each step of the updated order of operations, as demonstrated here with the provided 5+2 @ 4 expression."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: Step 1: Prime factor counting (#)
First, we need to calculate the prime factor count for each pair of numbers:

a) For 8 and 2: 8 # 2 = 3 (since the prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2, 2, and 2, and the prime factors of 2 are just 2)
b) For 6 and 6: 6 # 6 = 2 (since the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and they are both shared, making the count 2)

Step 2: Addition (A)
Now we add the results of the prime factor counting:

The answer is 3 + 2 = 5

So the outcome of the entire expression ""8 # 2 + 6 # 6"" follows the PEFMDASC order as:

1. Prime factor counting: 3, 2

Step 1: Parentheses (P):
  Solve the expression inside the parentheses first: 14 + 4 = 18

Step 2: Exponents (E):
  Since there are no exponents present in the expression, we can move on to the next step.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F):
  First, let's calculate the prime factor counting for 6 and 18:
  6 # 18 = 3 (since the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, prime factors of 18 are 2, 3, and 3, and 2 and 3 are shared twice)

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D, from left to right):
  Next, perform the multiplication operation: 6 @ 18 = 618

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S, from left to right):
  First, do the subtraction: 12 - 2 = 10
  Then, perform the addition: 618 + 10 = 628

Now, let's proceed with the second part of the expression, which is # 3:

Step 1: Parentheses (P):
  There are no parentheses present in this part of the expression.

Step 2: Exponents (E):
  Since there are no exponents present in the second part of the expression, we can move on to the next step.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F):
  3 # 3 = 1 (since prime factors of 3 are only 3 and there is only one shared prime factor, hence count = 1)

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D, from left to right):
  Since there are no multiplication or division operations present in this expression, we can proceed to the next step.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S, from left to right):
  0 (since the prime factor counting for 3 is 1, and for 0 is 0)

Step 6: Concatenation (C):
  Since there is no concatenation operation present in this part of the expression, we don't need to perform this step.

The answer is 628."
