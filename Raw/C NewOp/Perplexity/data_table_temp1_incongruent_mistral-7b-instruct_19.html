      <td>GPT Response: According to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), the first step is to perform the prime factor counting operation (F), so we calculate 4 # 3 = 0, since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 2 and 3, with no shared prime factors.<br><br>Then, since addition comes before prime factor counting in the new order of operations (A), we perform the addition, so the answer is 0 + 2 = 2.<br><br>The answer is 2.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Based on the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, prime factor counting (#) should be performed before addition (+). Therefore, let's focus on finding the unique prime factors common to |3| and |4|. The prime factors of 3 are 3, and the prime factors of 4 are 2. Since there is only one common prime factor "2," we have 3#4 = 1. Following the order of operations, the addition (+) is performed next: 1 + 2 = 3.<br><br>So, the solution to the problem 4#3 + 2 is:<br><br>The answer is __.<br>The answer is 3.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve the expression 4#3 + 2 using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), follow these steps:<br><br>1. Prime Factor Counting (F): First, find the prime factor count of 4 and 3. In this case, they share no prime factors: 4 = 2Â² * 2 * 7, 3 = 3. So, the prime factor count of 4 and 3 is 0.<br><br>2. Addition and Subtraction (AS): Since there's an addition sign, evaluate it next in the order. But in this case, it doesn't directly interact with the prime factor counting, so the sum can be calculated as 4 + 2 = 6.<br><br>3. Concatenation (C): Lastly, we have the concatenation operation. Since only addition has been performed, we simply have the number 6 from the previous step. Concatenating it with the number 3 (remember that 2 was subtracted in the addition step), we get 63.<br><br>The answer is 63.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Step 1: Identify the operations and their priorities based on the revised order of operations (PEFMDASC). In this expression, we have addition (A) and concatenation (C). According to the order, concatenation (C) comes before addition (A).<br><br>5 + 2@4<br><br>Step 2: Perform the concatenation operation (represented by @ symbol).

      <td>GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem using the new operations and the revised order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow the order of the operations as follows:<br><br>1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Since there are no parentheses or exponents in this expression, we can directly move to the next operation. However, since there are only two numbers involved, prime factor counting operation does not contribute to the final answer to this expression. So, the result of this operation is 0.<br>2. Addition and Subtraction (AS): Since there are only additions involved with no subtraction or negatives, we can simply perform the addition from left to right. So, the addition of 5 and 3 results in 8.<br>3. Concatenation (C): Since there is no multiplication, division or any other operation left to perform, we can directly evaluate the concatenation operation. As per the definition of concatenation, we need to concatenate the digits of the absolute values of the numbers involved. Since both the numbers are positive, we have |5| = 5 and |3| = 3. So, the concatenation of the digits of 5 and 3 is 53.<br><br>Therefore, the final answer to this problem, according to the newly updated order of operations, is:<br><br>The answer is 53.</td>
