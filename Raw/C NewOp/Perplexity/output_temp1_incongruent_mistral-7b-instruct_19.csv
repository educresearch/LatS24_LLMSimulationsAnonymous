systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression using the newly updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to identify which operations to perform first.

The expression is: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Since parentheses have the highest precedence, we will start by evaluating what's inside the parentheses:

1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18

Now, the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we have exponents, but there are no exponents in the expression, so the next operation is prime factor counting:

2. Evaluate prime factor counting: There are no common prime factors between 6, 18, 12, and 3, so the result is 0.

Now, we have multiplication and division, none in the expression, so we move on to addition and subtraction:

3. Evaluate addition and subtraction from left to right:
3.1. Subtract 2 from 12: 10
3.2. Concatenate 6 and 18: 618
3.3. Add the result with 6 @ 18 (which is 618): 626

So the final answer is:

The answer is 626."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

So, 2@4 = 24 (we concatenated the digits 2 and 4).

systemPrompt3_userPrompt2_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the new operations and order of operations, we need to follow the PEFMDASC rule.

First, let's deal with the prime factor counting operation (#):

Since we need to evaluate prime factor counting before addition, we'll find the prime factors for each number first and count how many shared prime factors they have:

* For 8: Prime factors: 2 × 2 × 2
* For 2: Prime factor: 2

Both numbers 8 and 2 share 1 prime factor, but since prime factors are unique in this context, this results in a prime factor counting operation of 0.

Now, let's perform the addition operation (+) with the results:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 0 + 6 # 6 = 6 (since we evaluate prime factor counting before addition)

Having determined that the prime factor counting operation and the first addition operation come out to be 6, the next operation we need to perform is the last concatenation operation (@).

Since we need to concatenate the results of the addition operation (6) with the last number (6), we apply the concatenation operation to the result:

Result = 6 @ 6 = 66

The final answer, in the form ""The answer is __,"" is:

The answer is 66."

In this case, we have addition (A) and prime factor counting (F). Since prime factor counting comes before addition, we first need to do the prime factor counting operation.

Given: 5 + 3 # 2

First, we perform the prime factor counting:

3 # 2 = 1 (since 3 and 2 each have only one prime factor: 3 for 3 and 2 for 2)

Now, we have 5 + 1. According to the updated order of operations, we perform the addition (A) operation:

5 + 2@4

Step 2: Perform the concatenation operation (represented by @ symbol). But first, calculate the absolute values of the operands (2 and 4), since concatenation is defined for absolute values only.

|2| @ |4|

Step 3: Apply the concatenation operation, which in this case, is simply the string combination of its absolute values. The absolute values of 2 and 4 are 2 and 4, respectively. So, 2@4 = 24.

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
Calculate the prime factor count for each pair:
a) 8 and 2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2, 2. The prime factors of 2 are 2. So, the count of shared unique prime factors is 2.
b) 2 and 6: The prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 6 are 2, 2, 3. Since there are 2 twos, the count is 1.
c) 6 and 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2, 2, 3. Since all are present in both 6s, the count is 3.

So, the calculation of prime factor counting is: 8 # 2 = 2, 2 # 6 = 1, 6 # 6 = 3.

2. Concatenation (C):

systemPrompt4_userPrompt3_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 4#3 + 2 using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), follow these steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): First, find the prime factor count of 4 and 3. In this case, they share no prime factors: 4 = 2² * 2 * 7, 3 = 3. So, the prime factor count of 4 and 3 is 0.

2. Addition and Subtraction (AS): Since there's an addition sign, evaluate it next in the order. But in this case, it doesn't directly interact with the prime factor counting, so the sum can be calculated as 4 + 2 = 6.

3. Concatenation (C): Lastly, we have the concatenation operation. Since only addition has been performed, we simply have the number 6 from the previous step. Concatenating it with the number 3 (remember that 2 was subtracted in the addition step), we get 63.

The answer is 63."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.
