mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC). According to this order, we should perform concatenation after addition. So, we first evaluate 2 @ 4, which is 24 (since the concatenation operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level), and then we add it to 5.

Therefore, the expression 5 + 2@4 becomes 5 + 24, which simplifies to 29.

The answer is 29."

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow the rules step by step.

The expression is: 5 + 3 # 2

First, we perform the prime factorization of the positive integers involved:
- Prime factors of 2: 2

Next, we count the number of unique prime factors shared by the numbers:
- 5 and 2 have no shared prime factors, so 5 # 2 = 0

Then, we substitute the result back into the original expression:
5 + 0

Lastly, we perform addition:
5 + 0 = 5

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve the expression $5 + 2@4$, we need to follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, which means we need to evaluate the concatenation operation before addition. The expression $2@4$ evaluates to $24$ because the concatenation of the digits of |2| and |4| is $24$. Therefore, the expression becomes $5 + 24$. Finally, we evaluate the addition to get $29$.

Therefore, the answer is 29."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the expression `8 # 2 + 6 # 6` with the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation, then the Addition (A) and finally the Concatenation (C).

The prime factors of `8` are `2` and `2`, and the prime factors of `2` are `2`. Therefore, `8 # 2 = 2`.

The prime factors of `6` are `2` and `3`, and the prime factors of `6` are `2` and `3`, so `6 # 6 = 2`.

Now, we substitute back the results and perform the addition:

`8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 2 + 2`

Finally, we do the Concatenation:

`2 + 2 = 22`

1. Parentheses: Calculate 14 + 4, which equals 18.
2. Prime Factor Counting (F): We now evaluate 2 # 3, which is the number of shared prime factors between 2 and 3. Since 2 only has one prime factor (itself), and 3 is a different prime number, there are no shared prime factors, so 2 # 3 equals 0.
3. Concatenation (C): Now, calculate 6 @ 18. Concatenation combines the digits of the absolute values, so this equals 618.
4. Subtraction (S): Perform 12 - 0 (from the previous step), resulting in 12.
5. Addition (A): Finally, add 618 + 12, resulting in 630.

The answer is 630."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we start by performing Prime Factor Counting (F) since it comes before Addition (A).

5 + 3 # 2

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: Let's break down the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the revised order of operations PEFMDASC.

Step 1: Calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) for the first part of the expression, 8 # 2:
8 # 2 = 3 (since the prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2 and the prime factors of 2 are 2, i.e., there is 1 shared prime factor 2)

Step 2: Calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) for the second part of the expression, 6 # 6:
6 # 6 = 1 (since the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 and the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, i.e., there is 1 shared prime factor 2 and 3)

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: Let's solve this step by step using the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Since both 4 and 3 are already prime numbers, so calculating their prime factors, we get that the count of unique prime factors shared between 4 and 3 is 0. Hence, 4 # 3 = 0.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Let's solve the given expression step by step, following the revised order of operations PEFMDASC:

The expression is: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

First, perform the operation inside the parentheses:

14 + 4 = 18, so the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Now, calculate the prime factor counting (F) operation:

2 # 3 = 1, since the shared prime factor between 2 and 3 is 1 (strictly speaking, there are no shared prime factors, so the result is 0; but as given in the problem description, 0 should be treated as 1).

So, the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

Next, perform the concatenation (C) operation (it is placed after F in the order and must be computed before addition and subtraction):

6 @ 18 = 618

So, the expression becomes: 618 + 12 - 1

Finally, perform addition and subtraction (A/S) from left to right:

618 + 12 = 630
630 - 1 = 629

The answer is 629."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: Let's solve the problem using the revised order of operations, PEFMDASC.

5 + 3 # 2

First, we should note that there are no parentheses or exponents in this expression, so we can skip those steps and move on to the prime factor counting (F).

Unfortunately, we cannot apply the prime factor counting operation, because it requires two numbers as operands, and currently both operands (3 and 2) are integers, not an operation. This expression seems to omit the prime factor counting operation. It can be assumed that the original expression is either ""5 + (3 # 2)"" or ""(5+3) # 2"", to ensure the correct placement of the prime factor counting operation.

I'll provide solutions for each possibility:

Expression 1: 5 + (3 # 2)

1. Calculate the prime factor counting operation:
   3 # 2 = 0 (there are no shared prime factors between the numbers 3 and 2)
2. Proceed to addition:
   5 + 0 = 5

Answer for Expression 1: The answer is 5.

Expression 2: (5 + 3) # 2

1. Perform the addition:
   5 + 3 = 8
2. Calculate the prime factor counting operation:
   8 # 2 = 1 (the number 2 is a prime factor for both 8 and 2)

Answer for Expression 2: The answer is 1.

You should double-check the original expression to find the proper placement of the prime factor counting operation and apply the correct solution accordingly."
