llama-2-70b-chat,1,700,systemPrompt1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations: PEFMDASC.

1. First, we need to evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses: 2 @ 4 = 24 (concatenation)
2. Next, we need to evaluate the exponents (none in this case)
3. Then, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting: 5 # 24 = 1 (since the shared prime factor between 5 and 24 is 5)
4. After that, we need to evaluate the multiplication and division (none in this case)
5. Then, we need to evaluate the addition and subtraction: 5 + 1 = 6 (since we need to add 1 to 5 for the shared prime factor)
6. Finally, we need to evaluate the concatenation: 5 + 24 = 29 (concatenation)

Explanation:

1. First, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting operations:
8 # 2 = 1 (since the prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 1, and the prime factors of 2 are 2, 1)
6 # 6 = 1 (since the prime factors of 6 are 2, 3, and the prime factors of 6 are 2, 3)
