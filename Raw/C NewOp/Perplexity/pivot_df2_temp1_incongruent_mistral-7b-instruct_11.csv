mistral-7b-instruct,1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: According to the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to perform prime factor counting before addition. Since the prime factor counting of 4 and 3 is 0 (as they have no shared prime factors), and since addition is commutative, the final answer without the parentheses would be the same if we had performed addition first. Thus:

The answer is 0.","GPT Response: According to the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to perform prime factor counting before addition. In this case, since 4 and 3 have no shared prime factors (their prime factorizations are 2^2 and 3, respectively), the prime factor counting operation (denoted as #) results in 0. Therefore, the final answer for the given expression ""4#3 + 2"" is:

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Given the new mathematical operations and the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), let's solve the problem step by step:

First, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation (#). In this case, we have 4 and 3 as operands:

4 # 3 = 1 (since both 4 and 3 have prime factors 2 and 2, but only one common prime factor, the answer is 1)

Now that we have evaluated the prime factor counting operation, we move on to the addition operation (A). But we also need to consider that concatenation (C) has a lower precedence than addition, so we have to perform 4 # 3 before the addition:

4 # 3 = 1

So, the operands for the addition operation are now 1 and 2:

1 + 2 = 3

Therefore, the solution to the problem is:

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 4#3 + 2, we following the updated order of operations, PEFMDASC:

1. Prime factor counting (F): 
   First, we perform prime factor counting for both numbers, 4 and 3. The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2. The prime factors of 3 are 3. Since there is no shared prime factor between 4 and 3, their prime factor counting result is 0.

2. Addition and Subtraction (A/S):
   Since there is no addition or subtraction within parentheses or involving exponents, we move on to the next step.

3. Concatenation (C):
   We now proceed with performing the concatenation operation. However, since there is no concatenation within parentheses or involving exponents, we move on to the next step.

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D):
   There are no multiplication or division operations present in our current expression, so we skip this step.

5. Exponents (E):
   There are no exponents in our current expression, so we move on to the next step.

6. Parentheses (P):
   There are no operations within parentheses in our current expression, so we move on to the final step.

Since we didn't find any operations to perform in any of the steps above (F, A/S, C, M/D, E, P), the answer is simply 0.

1. Concatenation (C): 2 @ 4
2. @ is the concatenation operation, so we join the digits of 2 and 4: 24

Now the problem becomes: 5 + 24

3. Addition (S): The addition operation is now last in the order of operations, so we perform addition:

Given expression: 5 + 2 @ 4

Given order of operations: PEFMDASC

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
There are no parentheses in the expression, so we move on to the next operation.

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents in the expression, so we move on to the next operation.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
There are no numbers given with negative signs or complex numbers, so prime factor counting is not applicable to this expression. We move on to the next operation.

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
The only sign of multiplication in the expression is ""@"" representing concatenation. But since concatenation is considered an operation separate from multiplication and division in the given order, we move on to the next operation.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
There are no parentheses in the expression, but we still need to check if any subtraction needs to be performed before addition. In this case, there is no subtraction, so we can directly perform the addition.

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
Now, we check for concatenation, denoted by ""@"" sign. In this case, the "" @ "" is between the numbers 2 and 4. So, we need to perform concatenation before addition.

Therefore, the given expression should be solved as follows:

5 + 2 @ 4 = 5 + 26 = 27

So, The answer is 27.","GPT Response: To solve the given mathematical expression under the newly introduced mathematical operations and updated order of operations, we need to follow the PEFMDASC rule:

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in the expression, so we move on to the next operation.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents in the expression, so we move on to the next operation.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We do not have enough information to determine the prime factors of the given numbers, so we move on to the next operation.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): The given expression contains an infix operation ""@"" which represents concatenation, but it looks like an incorrect symbol for multiplication. To resolve this, we should assume it to be addition (""+"") or subtraction (""-"") instead, as per the traditional mathematical notation. However, since there is no apparent addend or subtrahend, we cannot definitively determine which operation it should be. Therefore, we cannot apply the multiplication and division operation, and we need to move on to the next operation.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We are unable to determine whether it is an addition or subtraction operation based on the available information. Therefore, we cannot apply the addition and subtraction operation, and we need to move on to the next operation.
6. Concatenation (C): The given expression contains the symbol ""@"" which represents concatenation. Since the addends for addition or subtractands for subtraction are not provided, we have to assume that the given expression is a concatenation problem. However, since neither of the operands (5 and 2@4) is specified in the form ""|a|"" and ""|b|,"" we cannot perform concatenation yet. Concatenation is a binary operation and we require two operands to perform it. Let us assume that there was a missing ""at-sign"" between the numbers in the expression, such as ""5 @ 2 @ 4,"" and we should interpret ""2 @ 4"" as two separate operands to concatenate with ""5"" rather than an infix notation for multiplication or subtraction.

4. Multiplication and Division (MD): We don't have any multiplication or division present, so we move to the next step.
5. Addition and Subtraction (AS): We have an addition operation (+) present. Addition must be performed after prime factor counting (F). Hence, we have 5 + 1 = 6.

Therefore, 3 # 2 equals 1 as per the key examples provided.

Next, we move to the addition operation (A). Since 5 and 1 are addends, and 1 is the result of the prime factor counting operation, we perform the addition. The sum of 5 and 1 is 6.

1. Prime factors of 5: 5
2. Prime factors of 3: 3
3. Prime factors of 2: 2

Since 5 and 3 have no shared prime factors and 2 is a shared prime factor of both 5 and 3, the prime factor count is 1.

5 + 3 = 8

   The prime factors of 3 are 3.
   The prime factors of 2 are 2.

2. Since there is no common prime factor between 3 and 2, the prime factor count is 0 (according to the key examples provided, prime factor counting 0 for 1 and 0 has no shared prime factor).

3. Multiplication and Division (MD): Since there are no multiplication or division operations, we move to the next operation.

4. Addition and Subtraction (AS): Perform the addition operation.

4. Multiplication and Division (left to right): Nothing to perform in this step as there is no multiplication or division.
5. Addition and Subtraction (left to right): We have an addition sign (+) between 6 and the expression inside parentheses (18), so we perform that operation next.

Given expression: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Using the key examples, for the prime factor counting (#), we need to find the count of unique prime factors shared between two numbers.

First, let's find the prime factors for 8 and 2:
- Prime factors of 8: 2, 2, 2, 2
- Prime factors of 2: 2

Since there is only one prime factor '2' that is common between 8 and 2, so 8 # 2 = 1.

Next, let's find the prime factors for 6:
- Prime factors of 6: 2, 2, 3

There is no common prime factor between the prime factor sets of 6 and the previous result (1), which means 1 # 6 = 0.

Now, following the new order of operations, we need to perform addition (A) before concatenation (C). Since the prime factor counting (F) operation comes before addition (A) in the new order of operations, we made an error in handling the operations according to the order. We should have first done the prime factor counting operations for both numbers before performing the addition.

To correct this problem, let's find the prime factor set for 2 and 6 again:
- Prime factors of 2: 2
- Prime factors of 6: 2, 2, 3

Since there is only one prime factor '2' that is common between 2 and 6, we have 2 # 6 = 1.

Since prime factor counting is before addition, let's first find the prime factor counting for each term.

For 8 and 2, their prime factors are 2 (appearing twice) and 2, respectively. There is only one shared prime factor, so 8 # 2 = 1.

For 6 and 6, their prime factors are 2 (appearing twice) and 3, respectively. There is no shared prime factor, so 6 # 6 = 0.

   Since there is no # operation between the digits in 8 # 2, their prime factorization results can be directly concatenated: 8 # 2 = 8 (since it's equal to the prime factorization result), so the concatenation becomes: 8 @ 6 = 86.

So the answer is: The answer is 86.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the revised order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to follow these steps:

1. Prime factor counting (#):
   With the given expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6, since we need to perform prime factor counting (#) before addition and concatenation, let's calculate the prime factor count for each term individually:

   a. For 8 and 2: 8 = 2³ and 2 = 2, so 8 # 2 = 3 (since 2 and 2 are both 2).
   b. For 6 and itself: 6 = 2³ * 3. Thus, 6 # 6 = 2 (since 2 is a shared prime factor between both 6 and 6).

2. Addition and Subtraction (A/S):
   Since both terms 3 and 2 have gone through prime factor counting, we can proceed with the addition: 3 + 2 = 5.

3. Multiplication and Division (M/D):
   Since there is no multiplication or division in this expression, we move on.

4. Exponents (E):
   There are no exponents present, so nothing to calculate here.
