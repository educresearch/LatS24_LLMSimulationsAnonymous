In the first step, we use the Concatenation operation to join the digits of 6 and 18 together, resulting in 186.<br>2. In the second step, we use the Addition operation to add 12 to 186, resulting in 198.<br>3. In the third step, we use the Prime Factor Counting operation to subtract the number of shared prime factors between 198 and 3. Since 198 has 2 and 3 as prime factors, and 3 has only 3 as a prime factor, there is only one shared prime factor, which is 3. Therefore, 198 - 2 # 3 = 198 - 1 = 197.<br><br>I hope this step-by-step explanation helps clarify how to apply the new operations and updated order of operations in mathematics!</td>
