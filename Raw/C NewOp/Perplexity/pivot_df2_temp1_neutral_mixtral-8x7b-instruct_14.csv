Given expression: 4 # 3 + 2

First, calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) for 4 and 3:
Prime factors of 4: 2, 2
Prime factors of 3: 3

Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, the result of 4 # 3 is 0.

Now, we have a new expression: 0 + 2

The expression is: 5 + 3 # 2

First, we need to evaluate the prime factorization, which is step (F) in the order of operations:

3 # 2 = 1 (since the only prime factor of 3 is 3 and of 2 is 2, and they have no shared prime factors)

So, the expression becomes: 5 + 1

The answer is 6.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we start by evaluating the prime factor counting operation (F) inside the addition (A).

According to the prime factor counting definition (F), we need to find the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 3 and 2:

3 # 2 = 0

Since 3 and 2 have no shared prime factors, their prime factor counting (F) value is 0. Now, the given equation becomes:

5 + 0

1. Identify the operations in the given expression: addition (5 + 3) and prime factor counting (3 # 2).
2. Determine the order of operations to find the answer. Prime factor counting (F) comes before addition (A), so let's calculate the prime factor counting first.
3. Calculate the prime factorization of the numbers provided: 3 and 2. The prime factors of 3 are 3, and the prime factors of 2 are 2.
4. Observe that the shared prime factors between 3 and 2 is 0, since none of these numbers share a prime factor.

The answer is 629.","GPT Response: Let's break down the expression using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. Parentheses: Calculate the expression within the parentheses first, which is 14 + 4.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this expression.
3. Prime Factor counting (F): Now, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation, which is 2 # 3. Since 2 and 3 have no shared prime factors, the result is 0.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There are no multiplication or division operations in this expression.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Evaluate addition and subtraction from left to right. Calculate the concatenation operation first: 6 @ 18 (since it appears before subtraction). 6 @ 18 = 618. Then, subtract 2 from 618: 618 - 2 = 616.

3. Next, we apply the Prime Factor Counting operation (F) between 2 and 3: 2 # 3 = 0 (since they have no common prime factors)
4. Finally, we perform Subtraction (S): 618 - 0 = 618

The answer is 618.","GPT Response: Step 1: Follow the order of operations and perform the operation in the parentheses first.
14 + 4 = 18

Step 2: Now, we have (18) next to the concatenation operation. So, we perform the concatenation operation.
6 @ 18 = 618

Step 3: We now have 618 next to the addition operation. So, we perform the addition operation.
618 + 12 = 630

Step 4: Next is the subtraction operation. We subtract 2 from 630.
630 - 2 = 628

Step 5: Next is the prime factor counting operation. We count the shared prime factors between 628 and 3.
However, in this case, 3 is a prime number itself and does not share any prime factors with 628. So, 2 # 3 = 0.

Step 6: We now have 628 next to the prime factor counting operation with an output of 0. So, we perform the prime factor counting operation.
628 # 0 = 0

Step 7: We now have 0 next to the addition operation with an output of 628. So, we perform the addition operation.
628 + 0 = 628

For this problem, we only need to consider prime factor counting and concatenation.

8 # 2 = 1 (since the only prime factor of both 8 and 2 is 2, which is shared once)
6 # 6 = 2 (since the only prime factor of both 6 and 6 is 2 and 3, which are shared once each)

Therefore, the answer is 3, since concatenation is not necessary in this problem.

Answer: The answer is 3.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we must follow the new order of operations, PEFMDASC. In this case, there are no parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, or subtraction, so we start with the prime factor counting (F) operation:

Next, we have another prime factor counting operation:

6 # 6 = 2 (since 6 has the prime factors 2 and 3, and 6 has the prime factors 2 and 3, so there is 1 shared prime factor, 2)

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F) for the first pair of numbers, 8 and 2.
Prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2. Prime factors of 2 are 2. Therefore, the shared prime factor is 2. So, 8 # 2 = 1.

Step 2: Addition for the first pair of numbers, 8 # 2.
So, 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 6 # 6.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F) for the second pair of numbers, 6 and 6.
Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Prime factors of 6 are also 2 and 3. Therefore, the shared prime factors are 2 and 3. So, 6 # 6 = 2.
