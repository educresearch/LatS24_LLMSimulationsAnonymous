First, count the prime factors for `8` and `2`:
Prime factors of `8`: `2 * 2 * 2`
Prime factors of `2`: `2`

They share one `2` as a prime factor, so `8 # 2 = 1`.

Next, move to the right side of the addition sign:
First, count the prime factors for `6`: `2 * 3`

Now, count the prime factors for the second `6`: `2 * 3`

They share the same prime factors (`2` and `3`), so `6 # 6 = 2`.

For Prime Factor Counting (F) of 4 and 3:

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
The prime factors of 3 are 3.

There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, therefore, 4 # 3 = 0.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: Let's break down the expression using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. Parentheses: Calculate the expression inside the parentheses first. 14 + 4 = 18.
2. Prime Factor Counting (F): We don't have any shared prime factors yet, so nothing changes.
3. Concatenation (C): Still need to evaluate the addition before concatenation.

Now, the expression looks like this: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

4. Concatenation (C): Calculate the concatenation of 6 and 18, which is 618.

Now, the expression looks like this: 618 + 12 - 2 # 3

5. Addition: Calculate the addition, 618 + 12 = 630.

Now, the expression looks like this: 630 - 2 # 3

6. Subtraction: Calculate the subtraction, 630 - 2 = 628.

Now, the expression looks like this: 628 # 3

7. Prime Factor Counting (F): 3 is a prime number; thus, it only has one unique prime factor, itself. Clearly, 628 and 3 don't have any shared prime factors.

So, the final expression that needs to be calculated is just 0 (no shared prime factors).

1. P: Parentheses
   Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first:
   14 + 4 = 18
2. F: Prime Factor Counting (we do this before addition and subtraction)
   There are no prime factor counting operations left, so we proceed to the next operation in the order.
3. E: Exponents
   There are no exponents in this expression, so we proceed to the next operation in the order.
4. M/D: Multiplication and Division (left to right)
   There are no multiplication or division operations in this expression, so we proceed to the next operation in the order.
5. A/S: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: Let's solve the problem using the revised order of operations, PEFMDASC:

1. Check for parentheses: There are no parentheses in the expression, so we can move on to the next step.
2. Calculate exponents: There are no exponents in the expression, so we can move on to the next step.
3. Perform Prime Factor counting (F):
   a # b calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b.

   In this case, we have 3 # 2. So we need to find the prime factors of |3| and |2| first, which are 3 and 2 respectively. Then we look for shared prime factors between them and count how many there are. In this case, 3 and 2 have no shared prime factors, so the count is 0.

4. Perform Multiplication and Division (if any) from left to right, and then Addition and Subtraction (if any) from left to right: However, in this problem, since there are no multiplication, division, addition, or subtraction between the prime factor counting, we don't need to do steps 4-6 anymore.
5. Perform Concatenation (C) from left to right: There are no other concatenation operations left in the expression.

The answer is 5 + 3 # 2 = 5 + 0 = 5."
