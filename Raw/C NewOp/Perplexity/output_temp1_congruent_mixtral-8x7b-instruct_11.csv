First, there are no parentheses or exponents in this problem, so we move on to the prime factor counting operation (F). However, neither 5 nor 2 have any shared prime factors (since neither is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself), so 5 # 2 = 0.

The problem now simplifies to:

5 + 2 @ 4

We calculate the concatenation of 2 and 4, which is 2 @ 4 = 24.

The problem now simplifies to:

5 + 24

                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)

1. First, we evaluate the expression in the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18
2. Next, we calculate the Concatenation (C) of 6 and the result from step 1: 6 @ 18 = 618
3. Then, we perform the Subtraction (S) of 12 and 2: 12 - 2 = 10

5. Lastly, we perform the Addition (A) of the results from steps 2 and 3, and concatenate (C) that result with the result from step 4 (left to right): (618 + 10) @ 1 = 628@1 = 6281

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.
