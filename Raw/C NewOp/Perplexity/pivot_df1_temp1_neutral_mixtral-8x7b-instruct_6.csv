mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: For the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6, we need to follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, where # (Prime Factor Counting) has higher precedence than + (Addition).

First, let's find the Prime Factor Counting (F) for each component:

8 # 2 = 4 (since 8 has prime factors 2 and 2, while 2 has prime factor 2, so there is one shared prime factor 2. 4 is the result.)

6 # 6 = 2 (since both 6 and 6 have prime factors 2 and 3, but they share only one common prime factor 2. The result is 2.)

Now that we've calculated the Prime Factor Counting (F) for the components, let's proceed with the Addition (A).

4 + 2 = 6

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: Step 1: Calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) for the first pair of numbers, 8 and 2.
 The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2.
 The prime factors of 2 are 2.
 Since they share one common prime factor (2), the calculation of 8 # 2 is 1.

Step 2: Perform the addition operation for the first pair of numbers, 8 # 2 + 6.
 Now the equation becomes 1 + 6.

Step 3: Perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) for the second pair of numbers, 6 and 6.
 The prime factors of 6 are 2, 3.
 The prime factors of 6 are 2, 3.
 Since they share two common prime factors (2 and 3), the calculation of 6 # 6 is 2.

Step 4: Now, continue from where we left off in Step 2, which was an addition operation, 1 + 6 # 6.
 Now the equation becomes 1 + 2, as we just calculated that 6 # 6 is 2.

First, we solve the operation inside the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18

The expression now becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we perform the Prime Factor Counting operation: 2 # 3 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor is 2 once in both 2 and 3)
