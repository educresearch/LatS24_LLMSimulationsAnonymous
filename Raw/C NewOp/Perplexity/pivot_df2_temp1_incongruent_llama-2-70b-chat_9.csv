There are no parentheses in this expression, so we can move on to the next step.
2. E: Exponents
There are no exponents in this expression, so we can move on to the next step.
3. F: Prime Factor Counting
We need to calculate the prime factor counting of 5 and 2 first.

First, we need to evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses:

(14+4) = 18

Next, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting:

18 # 3 = 1

Now, we can evaluate the concatenation:

6 @ 18 = 6 @ 1800 = 10800

Next, we need to evaluate the addition:

10800 + 12 = 10812

Finally, we need to evaluate the subtraction:
