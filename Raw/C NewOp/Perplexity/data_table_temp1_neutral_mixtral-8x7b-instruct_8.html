We encounter addition (A) before concatenation (C), but since we cannot perform addition with a number and a concatenation, we need to evaluate the concatenation first.<br>4. In the concatenation (2 @ 4), we are simply combining the digits of 2 and 4, so 2 @ 4 = 24.<br>5. Now, our expression becomes 5 + 24.<br>6.
