      <td>GPT Response: To solve the problem 5 + 2@4, we need to follow the updated order of operations, PEFMDASC:<br><br>1. Parentheses: None in this equation, so we move on to the next step.<br>2. Exponents: None in this equation, so we move on to the next step.<br>3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We don't have absolute values or negative numbers, which is required for prime factor counting. Therefore, this operation doesn't apply.<br>4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): We have @ symbol which represents concatenation but it looks similar to multiplication symbol. However, since we are following the updated order of operations, we need to evaluate concatenation before multiplication and division. So, consider 2@4 as a single entity.<br>5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We now have 5 and 2@4. According to the order, we should evaluate addition before concatenation. However, since 2@4 is a single entity due to concatenation, addition doesn't make sense in this context.<br><br>Given that we cannot apply the operations as per the updated order, it seems that the given problem contains an error, or the newly introduced operations and order of operations are not compatible or well-defined for the given arithmetic expression 5 + 2@4.

In this problem, we don't have the values of 'a' and 'b' to perform Prime Factor Counting, so we move on to the next operation in the order.<br><br>Step 4: Multiply and divide from left to right (M/D). In this problem, we don't have any multiplication or division, so we move on to the next operation in the order.<br><br>Step 5: Add and subtract from left to right (A/S). Our first operation is @ which is concatenation and it comes after addition and subtraction in the given order of operations. Since there's no need to perform addition and subtraction currently, we move on to the next operation in the order.<br><br>Step 6: Perform the Concatenation (C). In this problem, we have '5 + 2@4'. The '@' symbol represents the Concatenation operation. We perform concatenation on the numbers that are right next to it, which are '2' and '4'.
