      <td>GPT Response: To solve the given Mathematics problem 4 # 3 + 2 using the newly introduced mathematical operations and updated order of operations, we'll follow the revised order: PEFMDASC.<br><br>First, let's handle the parentheses and exponents (in this problem, there are none). Next, we proceed with prime factor counting (F):<br><br>4 # 3<br>Since there are no negative numbers or shared prime factors, the result is 0 (as per the example (d)).<br><br>Now, we move to multiplication and division (M/D): there are none in this problem.<br><br>Next, addition and subtraction (A/S): we only have an addition operation (3 + 2).

      <td>GPT Response: Based on the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, for the given expression 4 # 3 + 2, we first need to perform prime factor counting before addition:<br><br>1. Perform prime factor counting with 4 and 3: 4 # 3 = 0 (since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3).<br>2. Since there is no prime factor counting involved between 4, 3, and 2 in the addition part of the expression, we directly perform the addition: 0 + 2 = 2.<br>3. Finally, since concatenation is the last operation in the order, we perform the concatenation of "0" and "2": "0" @ "2" = "02".<br><br>But we've made a mistake here since concatenation of two digits doesn't affect the numerical value. To rectify this, let's just show the numerical value of the solution instead of the concatenation:<br><br>The answer is 2. (This is the correct numerical value of the given expression.)<br><br>Keep in mind that the new concatenation operation can be ignored while performing arithmetic computations since it only represents the merging of digits, without any actual effect on the numerical value.

      <td>GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, follow the steps below:<br><br>1. Prime Factor Counting (F): First, we need to find the prime factor count for 4 and 3. Since 4 = 2² * 2 * 1 and 3 = 3, we only have one shared prime factor which is 2 with a count of 2. So the result of the prime factor counting operation is 2.<br>2. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Next, we evaluate the addition part of the expression, 3 + 2. The answer to this operation is 5.<br>3. Concatenation (C): Since we have the results of prime factor counting and addition, we can now perform the concatenation operation. In this case, we concatenate the results 2 and 5.

      <td>GPT Response: To solve the given problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow the given sequence:<br><br>1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Since there is a # (Prime Factor Counting) operation present between the addition (+) symbols, we need to perform prime factor counting first.<br>2. In this problem, the prime factor counting operation is between the numbers 3 and 2, so we need to find the unique prime factors shared by |3| and |2|. The prime factor of 3 is 3, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. There is only one shared prime factor, 2. So, 3 # 2 = 1.<br>3. Addition (A): After performing the prime factor counting, we need to add the numbers 5 and 3 (from the original problem), which were kept aside before performing the prime factor counting.<br><br>So, the final calculation is: 1 + 5 = 6.<br><br>The answer is 6.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: According to the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to perform prime factor counting before addition. Since the prime factor counting operation between 3 and 2 results in 0, there are no shared prime factors. Therefore, we move on to the addition operation. The addition of 5 and 3 results in 8. So the solution is:<br><br>The answer is 8.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Given problem: 5 + 3#2<br><br>Solution:<br><br>According to the updated order of operations, we need to follow the sequence: Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting, Multiplication & Division (from left to right), Addition & Subtraction (from left to right), and Concatenation (from left to right).<br><br>However, in this problem, there are no parentheses, exponents, or multiplication involved. So our sequence simplifies to: Prime Factor Counting (F), Addition & Subtraction (A/S), Concatenation (C).<br><br>Let's evaluate Prime Factor Counting first:<br>3#2 = 3 (as per the examples, the count of unique prime factors shared between 3 and 2 is 0).<br><br>Since there is no multiplication or division, let's go directly to Addition & Subtraction:<br>5 + 3 = 8<br><br>Lastly, there's no need for Concatenation either.<br><br>So, we have 3 (from prime factor counting) + 8 (from addition) which equals 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Step 1: Evaluate prime factor counting (F). In this case, the prime factor counting operation is applied to the numbers 3 and 2. Three prime factors for 3 are 3, and for 2 is 2. Since there is only one prime factor that is common between 3 and 2, the result of this operation is 1. So, 3 # 2 = 1.<br><br>Step 2: Evaluate addition and subtraction (A/S). Here we have 5 + 1 (from step 1, the result of 3 # 2). We follow the left-to-right rule as per the updated order, so we first evaluate the number inside the parentheses: 1. Then we perform the addition: 5 + 1 = 6.<br><br>So, following the PEFMDASC order of operations, the intermediate steps for the given problem would be as follows:<br><br>1.

Exponents: None.<br>3. Prime Factor counting (F): Again, there are no exponents or parentheses that need to be evaluated before prime factor counting. So we proceed to the next step. Since the operands of the concatenation operation ' @ ' are integers 5, 2 and 4. Prime factor count of 5, 2 and 4 are {2, 1, 2}, {2, 1} and {2, 2} respectively. The count of unique prime factors shared by any pair of numbers is the Intersection of their prime factor lists counted with multiplicity. Since Intersection of {2,1,2}, {2,1} and {2,2} is an empty set. Therefore, prime factor counting operation returns 0.<br>4. Multiplication and Division (M and D): None in the expression.<br>5. Addition and Subtraction (A and S): The expression contains only addition and concatenation operations. Since addition should be done before concatenation as per PESMDASC rule, we will perform the addition first.<br>6.
