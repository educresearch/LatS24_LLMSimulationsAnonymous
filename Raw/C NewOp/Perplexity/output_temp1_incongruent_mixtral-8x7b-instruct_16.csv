systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: Let's go through the problem step by step, following the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Parentheses: Calculate the expression inside the parentheses first.
  14 + 4 = 18

2. Prime Factor counting (F): 
  Since there are no negative numbers left, we can proceed with the calculation.
  There are no shared prime factors between 6 and 18, so 6 # 18 = 0.

3. Concatenation (C):
  Now, we can proceed with concatenation.
  6 @ 18 = 618

4. Addition and Subtraction (A and S):
  There are addition and subtraction operations left. We calculate them from left to right.
  618 + 12 = 630
  630 - 2 = 628

Now we can see that there are no more operations left. So:

The answer is 628."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

1. Since there are no parentheses or exponents, we proceed to prime factor counting (F). However, in this expression, there is no need to perform prime factor counting because there are no multiplication, division, absolute value, or numbers to which we can apply this operation.
2. Next, we evaluate the concatenation (C). The number 2 is concatenated to the result of 4 @ 5 (in that order, because according to the order of operations, concatenation is last to be evaluated):
   4 @ 5 = 45 (since the digits of both numbers are 4 and 5)
   2 @ 45 = 245 (result of the concatenation)
3. Now, we evaluate the addition (A). We add 5 to the result of the above step:
   5 + 245 = 250

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: Step 1: According to the order of operations, we first evaluate the expression in parentheses. 

14 + 4 = 18

So, the expression becomes:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Next, we perform the Concatenation operation (C). 

6 @ 18 = 618

So, the expression becomes:

618 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 3: Then, we perform the Prime Factor Counting operation (F).

2 # 3 = 1 (since the only prime factor of 2 is 2 and of 3 is 3, and they don't have any common prime factors)

So, the expression becomes:

618 + 12 - 1

Step 4: Next, we perform Addition and Subtraction (A/S) from left to right.

618 + 12 = 630

So, the expression becomes:

630 - 1

Step 5: Finally, we perform the last Subtraction operation.

630 - 1 = 629

So,

The answer is 629."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.
                    It's crucial to get this right for accurate calculations.

Given expression: 5 + 3 # 2

First, we perform the Prime Factor Counting (F): find the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 3 and 2.

3 # 2 = 0, as there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2.

So, the given expression becomes: 5 + 0

Next, we perform Addition (A):

5 + 0 = 5

Therefore,
