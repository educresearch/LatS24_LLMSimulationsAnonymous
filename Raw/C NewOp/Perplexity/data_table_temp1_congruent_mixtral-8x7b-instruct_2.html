Parentheses: There are no parentheses in this problem, so we move on to the next operation.<br>2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this problem, so we move on to the next operation.<br>3. Prime Factor Counting (F): There are no prime factor counting operations in this problem, so we move on to the next operation.<br>4. Multiplication and Division (M and D, from left to right): There are no multiplication or division operations in this problem, so we move on to the next operation.<br>5. Addition and Subtraction (A and S, from left to right): We have an addition operation: 5 + 2. We perform this operation first.<br>   - 5 + 2 = 7<br>6. Concatenation (C, from left to right): We now have a concatenation operation: 7 @ 4. However, since there is no absolute value sign around 7, we must preserve its sign.

      <td>GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations:<br><br>1. Since there are no parentheses or exponents in the expression, we proceed to the next operation in the order, which is Prime Factor Counting (F). However, in this particular expression, there are no appearances of the prime factor counting operation (#).<br>2. The next operation in the order is Multiplication and Division (M/D), but neither of these operations appears in the expression.<br>3. We now move on to Addition and Subtraction (A/S), and we see that there is an addition operation (5 + 2). So, let's perform this operation first:<br>   - 5 + 2 = 7<br>4. The next (and final) operation in the order is Concatenation (C). We see that there is a concatenation operation (2 @ 4) in the expression. Now, we should perform this concatenation:<br>   - 2 @ 4 = 24<br>5. As the final step, replace the original expression with the calculated value:<br>   - The answer is 7 @ 24 (or 724 after concatenation is performed).<br><br>The answer is 724.</td>
