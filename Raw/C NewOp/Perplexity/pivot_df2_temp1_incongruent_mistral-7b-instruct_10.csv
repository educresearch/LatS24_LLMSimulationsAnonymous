Therefore, the addition operation is performed next on the results of prime factor counting, which is 0 and 2. Hence, the final answer is:

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), prime factor counting (F) should be performed before addition (A). However, in this specific problem, none of the numbers involve any negative signs or exponents, so both prime factor counting and addition can be directly applied to the given numbers. In this case, we don't need to apply parentheses, exponents, or multiplication/division since they are not involved in the given operation.

Given expression: 4#3 + 2

First, calculate prime factor counting for 4 and 3:
- Prime factors of 4: 2, 2
- Prime factors of 3: 3

Since there's only one common prime factor (2), the prime factor counting result is 1.

Next, perform the addition:
1 (from prime factor counting) + 2 = 3

Given expression: 5 + 2@4

Since ""@"" is the concatenation operation, which comes after addition in the given order of operations, we need to first perform the addition operation.

5 + 2 = 7

Now that we have the value of the addition, we can perform the concatenation operation. Since both operands are single digits, we simply concatenate them to get:

7@4 = 74

So, the answer is 74.

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: Based on the newly updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to evaluate the concatenation operation before addition. Therefore, the problem 5 + 2@4 should be solved as follows:

1. Evaluate 2@4 (Concatenation operation): 2@4 = 24
2. Perform addition: 5 + 24

The answer is 29. Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations, PEFMDASC. In this case, we only have addition and concatenation. Since concatenation takes precedence over addition, we need to perform the concatenation first.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: Given expression: 5 + 3 # 2

Since the order of operations has been expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, we need to follow the new sequence:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Prime Factor Counting
4. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
5. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)
6. Concatenation

In the given expression, there are no parentheses, exponents, or concatenation involved. However, there are prime factor counting and addition.

First, let's examine the prime factor counting operation (#). To perform this operation, we need to identify the unique prime factors shared by the numbers being compared.

The prime factors of 5 are 5.
The prime factors of 3 are 3.
The prime factors of 2 are 2.

Since there is only one number (2) that is a prime factor for both 5 and 3, the prime factor counting operation (#) results in 1.

Now, let's evaluate the addition operation (+):

The sum of 5 and the result of 3 # 2 (which is 1) is:

5 + 1 = 6

To solve the problem, we need to apply the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. Parentheses: None in this problem
2. Exponents: None in this problem
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): 3 and 2 are integers, and their prime factorizations are 3 = 3 and 2 = 2. W▓e have one common prime factor (2), so 3 # 2 = 1.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): None in this problem
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We first need to perform the prime factor counting (step 3) for the given integers. So, 3 # 2 = 1.

Therefore, The answer is 6.","GPT Response: Step 1: Identify the operations in the expression and their respective priorities based on the revised order of operations (PEFMDASC). In the given input, we have addition (A) and prime factor counting (F). Since prime factor counting has a higher priority than addition, we will perform prime factor counting first.

Step 2: Perform the prime factor counting operation. Since there is only one prime factor shared between 3 and 2, let's denote it as p, the prime factor.

3 has the prime factors 3
2 has the prime factors 2

Since both 3 and 2 share the prime factor '2', we have 1 unique prime factor shared between them.

Step 3: Perform the addition operation using the result of the prime factor counting step.

   (14 + 4) = 18

Now, we apply the new operations according to their priority as expressed in PEFMDASC:

2. Prime factor counting: 
   2#3 = 0 (no shared prime factors)

mistral-7b-instruct,1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the expanded order of operations PEFMDASC, we first focus on the prime factor counting (F) operation:

1. Find the prime factors for |8| which is 2³ and |2|, same for |6| which is 2 × 3. Since both numbers share the prime factor 2, the prime factor counting operation # results in 1. So 8 # 2 = 2 # 6 = 1.

The prime factor counting has been completed, so the next operation is multiplication and division (M and D). Since we don't have any exponents, multiplication or division, we move on to the next operation, addition and subtraction (A and S).

However, there are no addition or subtraction signs in our given expression, so the only remaining operation is concatenation (C). Since we don't have any parentheses or exponents either, we follow the left-to-right rule for concatenation and join the digits of 8 (1000) and 2 (0010) to get 1000010 for the final answer.

The answer is 10,00010.","GPT Response: To solve the given expression using the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to handle the prime factor counting (F) and concatenation (C) operations, which are performed from left to right.

1. Evaluate # operation:
   - Find the prime factors for the absolute values, count the shared prime factors, and determine the result.
   - For 8 and 2: 8 has prime factors 2³, 2, and 2 and 2 has prime factors 2. Since 2 is a common prime factor, it is counted only once. Thus, the result is 1.
   - For 6 and 6: 6 has prime factors 2 and 3 twice, therefore the result is 2.

2. Perform concatenation:
   - Concatenate the results of the # operation (which are digits) to form the final result.
   - Since 1 and 2 are digits, the final result is 12.

So, the solution to the given expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the new order of operations PEFMDASC is:

The answer is 12.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations, PEFMDASC. Since there are no parentheses, we begin with prime factor counting (F).

First, let's find the prime factors of 8 (2² × 2³) and 2 (2), then compare them:

8 # 2 = 1 (since there's only one prime factor '2' in 8 and no common prime factors in 2)

Now, we move on to the addition (A). Since there's only one addition sign, we don't need to worry about evaluating addition from left to right. So, we can proceed to the next operation, which is concatenation (C).

Since there's only one concatenation sign, and no parentheses, we can execute concatenation last.

1. Prime factor counting (8 # 2): 1
2. Concatenation: Since there is no operation left, we'll have the final result as 1.

The answer is 1.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, follow these steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
   For 8 # 2:
   Prime factors of 8: {2, 2, 2, 2}
   Prime factors of 2: {2}
   They have 1 common prime factor 2, so 8 # 2 = 1.

   For 6 # 6:
   Prime factors of 6: {2, 3}
   Prime factors of 6: {2, 3}
   They have 2 common prime factors 2 and 3, so 6 # 6 = 2.

2. Multiplication and Division (M/D):
   Since there is neither multiplication nor division, we proceed to the next operation.

3. Exponents (E):
   Since there are no exponents in the expression, we proceed to the next operation.

4. Concatenation (C):
   We can perform concatenation now:
   1: 1 (from step 1 with 8 # 2)
   2: 2 (from step 1 with 6 # 6)
   Concatenation of 1 and 2 is 12.
