mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC). According to this order, we need to perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation before Addition and Subtraction (A, S).

First, let's find the prime factors of the numbers 8 and 2. The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Therefore, the shared prime factors of 8 and 2 are 2, so 8 # 2 = 1.

Similarly, let's find the prime factors of the numbers 6 and 6. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and since 6 is repeated twice, the prime factors of 6 are still 2 and 3. Therefore, the shared prime factors of 6 and 6 are 2 and 3, so 6 # 6 = 2.
