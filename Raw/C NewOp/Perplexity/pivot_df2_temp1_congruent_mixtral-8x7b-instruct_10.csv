mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC). According to this order, we need to perform prime factor counting (F) before addition (A).

So, we first calculate 4 # 3, which is the count of unique prime factors shared by 4 and 3. Since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3, there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3. Therefore, 4 # 3 = 0.

Next, we perform addition (A) and add 2 to 0. Therefore,

4 # 3 + 2 = 0 + 2 = 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we must follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), which includes Prime Factor counting (F) before Addition/Subtraction (A/S).

First, calculate the Prime Factor counting (F) for 4 # 3:

Prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, while prime factors of 3 are 3. There are no shared prime factors.
Therefore, 4 # 3 = 0.

Now, perform the addition: 0 + 2 = 2.

So, the answer is:

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: First, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation. The prime factors of 4 are 2 and the prime factors of 3 are 3. They have no common prime factor, so 4 # 3 equals 0.

Then, the expression becomes: 0 + 2

Next, we evaluate the addition operation:

0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Let's solve the problem 4 # 3 + 2 using the revised order of operations PEFMDASC.

4 # 3 + 2

First, we calculate the prime factor counting (F) of 4 and 3.

Prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, hence only one unique prime factor 2.
Prime factors of 3 are 3, hence no unique prime factors shared with 4.
Therefore, 4 # 3 = 1.

Now the expression becomes:

1 + 2

Next, we perform addition (A) since no other operations of higher precedence remain.

The answer is 3."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: To solve this expression using the new order of operations, we need to follow the steps PEFMDASC.

Given expression: 5 + 3#2

First, we evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation:

3#2 = 2 (since the prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2)

So, the expression becomes: 5 + 2

Next, we perform the addition (A) operation:

5 + 2 = 7

Therefore, the answer is 7.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first perform the prime factor counting operation:

3 # 2 = 0, since the only prime factors of 3 are 3 and 2 has no prime factors.

Next, we perform addition:

5 + 0 = 5

Therefore,

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, according to the new order of operations, we need to perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) and then the Addition (A).

5 + (3 # 2)

First, calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) of 3 and 2:
3 # 2 = 1

Then, plug this result back into the expression and perform the Addition (A):
5 + 1 = 6

The answer is 6.","GPT Response: Step 1: Evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation.
5 # 2 = 0 (since the prime factors of 5 are 5 and the prime factors of 2 are 2, and there are no shared prime factors, i.e., 0).

Step 2: Perform the Addition (A) operation.
5 + 0 = 5

The answer is 5."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations, we need to follow the rules PEFMDASC.

First, we do the addition inside the parentheses:

5 + 2 @ 4

This simplifies to:

7 @ 4

Now, we can perform the concatenation operation:

7 @ 4 = 74

So, the answer is:

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first evaluate the expression inside the parentheses, which is just the addition:

5 + 2 @ 4
= 7 @ 4 (since addition before concatenation)
= 74 (since concatenation of 7 and 4)

So, the answer is 74.","GPT Response: First, we need to evaluate the concatenation operation since it comes before addition in the order of operations (PEFMDASC). The concatenation of 2 and 4 is 24.

So, the expression becomes:

5 + 24

Lastly, we need to perform addition:

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: Let's solve this problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations, focusing on the new operations and their placement:

1. Consider the expression: 5 + 2 @ 4
2. Since there are no parentheses or exponents, we proceed to the next operation in the order, which is Prime Factor Counting (F). However, in this case, there is no need for prime factor counting since neither 5 nor 2 contains any shared prime factors with 4. So, we move on to the next operation.
3. The next operation is Multiplication and Division (M/D), but there are no multiplication or division operations in the expression. So, we move on to the next operation.
4. The next operation is Addition and Subtraction (A/S). Now, we have 5 + 2. Perform the addition: 5 + 2 = 7.
5. We are left with the expression: 7 @ 4
6. Since Concatenation (C) is the next operation in the order, and it is not inside any parentheses, perform the concatenation operation: 7 @ 4 = 74

The answer is 74."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: Let's go step by step with the given expression, following the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18
2. Exponents: There are no exponents in the expression.
3. Prime Factor counting: We'll perform this operation when we have two numbers to compare.

Now, we evaluate the expression from left to right, taking into account the previous steps:

6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 (concatenation, multiplication, subtraction; from left to right)

Perform the concatenation:

618 + 12 - 2

Then, the subtraction:

618 + 10

Since there are no more multiplication, division, addition, or subtraction operations, we perform the prime factor counting operation:

618 # 10 = 0, since there are no shared prime factors between them.

The answer is 628.","GPT Response: First, we need to follow the order of operations and evaluate what is inside the parentheses:

6 @ (14 + 4) = 6 @ 18

Next, we do the concatenation:

6 @ 18 = 618

Then, we perform the subtraction:

618 + 12 - 2

Followed by the addition:

630 - 2 = 628

Now, we perform the prime factor counting (F) operation:

628 # 3

The prime factors of 628 are 2 and 157, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since there are no shared prime factors, the result is:

628 # 3 = 0

So, the answer is:

The answer is 0.","GPT Response: First, according to the new order of operations, we need to evaluate what's inside the parentheses:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

14 + 4 = 18, so now the expression becomes:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we evaluate the concatenation operation:

618 @ 12 + 10 # 3

There are no other operations to do within the parentheses, so now it's just:

618 + 10 # 3

Evaluating the prime factor counting operation gives us:

618 + 10 # 3 = 618 + 0 = 618

Therefore,

The answer is 618.","GPT Response: Step 1: Evaluate the expression in the parentheses.
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 (since 14 + 4 = 18)

Step 2: Perform the Concatenation operation (C).

Step 3: Perform the Addition operation (A).
= 630 - 2 # 3

Step 4: Perform the Subtraction operation (S).
= 628 # 3

Step 5: Perform the Prime Factor Counting operation (F).

First, let's calculate 8#2:

The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Therefore, they have one shared prime factor, 2. So,

8#2 = 1

Next, let's calculate 6#6:

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 6 are also 2 and 3. Therefore, they have two shared prime factors, 2 and 3. So,

6#6 = 2

Finally, add the results of 8#2 and 6#6:

8#2 + 6#6 = 1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: For the expression 8#2 + 6#6, we need to follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC. In this case, there are no Parentheses (P), Exponents (E), or Multiplication/Division (M/D), so we proceed directly to Prime Factor Counting (F).

First, calculate 8#2:

8 has prime factors of 2*2*2
2 has prime factors of 2

Shared prime factors between 8 and 2: 2
So, 8#2 = 1

Next, calculate 6#6:

6 has prime factors of 2*3
6 has the same prime factors of 2*3

Shared prime factors between 6 and 6: 2, 3
Since we need to count unique prime factors, 2 and 3 are separate factors. So, 6#6 = 2
