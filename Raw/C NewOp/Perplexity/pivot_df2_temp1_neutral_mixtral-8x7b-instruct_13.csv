mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow these steps:

1. Parentheses: there are no parentheses in this problem, so we can skip this step.
2. Exponents: there are no exponents in this problem, so we can skip this step.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): we need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation between 2 and 4. The prime factors of 2 are 2 and the prime factors of 4 are 2. Therefore, the prime factor counting operation between 2 and 4 is 1 (since there is one shared prime factor, 2).
4. Multiplication and Division (L to R): there are no multiplication or division operations in this problem, so we can skip this step.
5. Addition and Subtraction (L to R): we need to evaluate the addition operation between 5 and the result of the prime factor counting operation, which is 1. Therefore, the addition operation between 5 and 1 is 6.
