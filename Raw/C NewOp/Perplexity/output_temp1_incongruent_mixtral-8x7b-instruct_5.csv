1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in this problem, so we move to the next step.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this problem, so we move to the next step.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We count the number of unique prime factors shared by 2 and 4. Since 2 and 4 share one prime factor (which is 2), we have 1 as the result of this operation. However, based on the order of operations, we must wait to perform this step until addition is done.
4. Multiplication, Division: There are no multiplication or division operations in this problem, so we move to the next step.
5. Addition, Subtraction (A): We perform the addition operation first: 5 + 2. The result is 7.

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

In this case, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we start with prime factor counting (F):

8 # 2

The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and the prime factor of 2 is 2. Since they share one prime factor, the result is 1.

8 # 2 = 1

Next, we perform the addition:

1 + 6 # 6

First, calculate 6 # 6:
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since they share a prime factor of 2, the result is 1.

The prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since there are no shared prime factors, 3 # 2 = 0.

Next, we perform addition (A) since there are no other operations with higher precedence according to the PEFMDASC order of operations.

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

14 + 4 = 18

Step 2: Perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation.
6 @ 18 = 6 @ (2 x 3^2) = 6 @ 2 @ 3^2 = 623 (since we need to evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operation before Concatenation)

Step 3: Perform the Multiplication and Division operations (if any) from left to right. In this case, there are no Multiplication or Division operations.

Step 4: Perform the Addition and Subtraction operations (if any) from left to right.
623 + 12 = 635

Step 5: Perform the Concatenation (C) operation from left to right.
635 - 2#3 = 635 - 0 = 635 (since there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3, so 2#3 = 0)

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): We start by evaluating the prime factor counting operation, which is represented by the ""#"" symbol. The expression we need to evaluate is 3 # 2.

2. Prime Factors of 3 and 2: The prime factors of 3 are 3, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, the prime factor counting operation will result in 0.

3. Addition (A): The next operation in the order is addition, represented by the ""+"" symbol. The expression we need to evaluate is 5 + 0.

4. Addition Result: Adding 5 and 0, we get 5.

Therefore,

The answer is 5."
