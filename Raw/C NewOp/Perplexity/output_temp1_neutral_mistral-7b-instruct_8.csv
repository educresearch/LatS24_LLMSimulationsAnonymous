Presenting the given expression as 8 # 2 + 6 # 6:

Since prime factor counting must be performed before addition, we calculate the prime factor counts of 8 and 2 separately:

1. Prime factor count of 8: 2Â³ * 2 * 7
2. Prime factor count of 2: 2

Since there's only one prime factor (2) that appears in both counts, we can now evaluate the prime factor counting operation:

8 # 2 = 1

Now, we can perform the addition:

Since the result of the prime factor counting operation is 1, the addition operation becomes 1 + 6 # 6.

We already calculated 6 # 6 = 0 in a provided example (the reason being no prime factors are common between 6 and 6, so the count is 0).

Now, the expression becomes 1 + 0 = 1.

Hence, the final answer is:

systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: According to the expanded order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to handle the parentheses:

(14 + 4) = 18

Now, the expression becomes:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we evaluate addition before concatenation:

6 @ 20 (since 18 + 12 = 20)

Then, we perform prime factor counting before subtraction:

6 # 20 = 2 (since 6 has prime factors 2 and 3, and 20 has prime factors 2 and 5. We only have 1 prime factor 2 in common, so the prime factor counting is 2.)

Now we can perform the remaining subtraction:

6 @ 20 - 2 = 620 - 2 = 619

Finally, we perform conccatenation:

619

The answer is 619."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

Performing the prime factor counting operation on the numbers 2 and 3, we have:
1. Determine the prime factors of each number: prime factors of 2 are 2, and prime factors of 3 are 3.
2. Count the shared prime factors: in this case, there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3, as their prime factor sets {2} and {3} have no common elements.
3. Therefore, the result of 2 # 3 is equal to 0.

systemPrompt3_userPrompt2_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem using the updated mathematical operations and order, we need to follow the PEFMDASC rule:

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in the given expressions, so we move on to the next operation.
2. Exponents: None present.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F):
   The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. They share one prime factor, 2, so the prime factor counting (#) operation results in 1.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): None present.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S):
   We have two expressions: 8 # 2 and 6 # 6. By the property of prime factor counting (#), we need to find the prime factors of each number and determine how many unique prime factors they share.

    Prime factors of 8: 2, 2
    Prime factors of 2: 2

    They share one prime factor, so the prime factor counting operation (#) results in 1 for both expressions.

6. Concatenation (C):
   We combine the results of the prime factor counting operations: 1 and 1, resulting in 11.

So, following the updated order of operations, PEFMDASC, our final calculation is:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): 1 (for both 8 and 2)
2. Prime Factor Counting (F): 1 (for 6 and 6)
3. Concatenation (C): 11

The answer is 11."

In this case, we have addition (A) and prime factor counting (F) as the first two operations.

First, we perform prime factor counting (F) on the given numbers:
- For 2: prime factors are 2
- For 3: prime factors are 2 and 3
- For the concatenation of 2 and 3 (denoted as @): no shared prime factors, so the prime factor count is 0.

Next, we perform the addition (A). Since we have the number 5 along with the result of the prime factor counting (the number 0), we simply add 5 to 0:

The answer is 5."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:

                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)

systemPrompt4_userPrompt3_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the PEFMDASC order, follow these steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): 
Calculate the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 4 and 3. Since prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and prime factors of 3 are 3, there is no shared prime factor. So, 4 # 3 = 0.

2. Concatenation (C):
Since we have the result of the prime factor counting operation, we can now perform the concatenation. Since 0 and any other number (in this case, 3) do not share any prime factors, the concatenation of 0 and 3 is just the number 3.

3. Addition (A):
Perform the addition operation with the outcome of the concatenation as the addends. Add 2 to the result obtained in the previous step (3):

The answer is 5."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

1. The '+' symbol represents addition.
2. The '#' symbol represents Prime Factor Counting (F).
3. The '+' sign and the '3' and '2' are operands for the Prime Factor Counting operation (they are the two numbers being compared for shared prime factors).
4. The '5' is an operand for the addition operation.

Under the PEFMDASC order, we first perform Prime Factor Counting (F) on the operands 3 and 2:

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F):
Since both 3 and 2 are positive integers, their prime factors are all positive as well. From the key examples given, we see that prime factors for 2 are 2, and the prime factors for 3 are 3. As we discussed before, since there is no shared prime factor between these two numbers, their prime factor count is 0 (as in example (c)).

Step 2: Addition (A/S): Now that we have the Prime Factor Counting performed, we can move on to the addition operation: Add 5 to the result of the prime factor counting step.

Step 3: The answer is: 5 + 0 = 5.

Therefore, the answer to the expression 5 + 3 # 2, using the PEFMDASC order, is 5."
