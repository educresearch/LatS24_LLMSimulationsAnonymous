llama-2-70b-chat,1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: Using the updated order of operations, we first evaluate the prime factor counting operation:

4 # 3 = 1

Next, we evaluate the addition operation:

4 # 3 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3

Therefore, the final answer is 3.","GPT Response: Using the revised order of operations, PEFMDASC, we have:

1. Parentheses: none
2. Exponents: none
3. Prime Factor Counting: 4 # 3 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor between 4 and 3 is 1)
4. Multiplication and Division: none
5. Addition and Subtraction: none
6. Concatenation: none

Therefore, 4#3 + 2 can be simplified as follows:

4 # 3 = 1
+ 2 = 3

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (4#3) before adding 2.

4#3 = 4#(3) = 1 (since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3 and 1, and there is only 1 shared prime factor, which is 2)

So, the equation becomes:
4#3 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step, following the PEFMDASC order of operations.

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): 4 # 3 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor between 4 and 3 is 1)
2. Addition (A): 1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3.

Now, let's try another example:

123 # 456 - 78

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): 123 # 456 = 3 (since the shared prime factors between 123 and 456 are 3, 3, and 1)
2. Subtraction (S): 3 - 78 = -75

The answer is -75.

I hope these examples help illustrate how to use the new operations and updated order of operations. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!"
