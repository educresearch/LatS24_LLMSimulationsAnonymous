Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Perform the addition operation.<br>   Since the prime factor count was 0, there is no change in the value, so the expression remains 4 # 3 + 2 = 4.<br><br>However, it is important to note that since the prime factor count operation did not change the value of the expression, it is unnecessary in this particular expression. Technically, the problem becomes 4 + 2 = 6, but since there is no need to use the new operations or the updated order of operations in this case, it is simpler to just perform the addition directly.<br><br>When solving more complex expressions that involve the new mathematical operations, make sure to follow the correct order: Parentheses (P) > Exponents (E) > Prime Factor Counting (F) > Multiplication and Division (M/D) > Addition and Subtraction (A/S) > Concatenation (C). This will ensure that the problem is solved correctly according to the new rules.</td>
