First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 2 @ 4 = 2(4) = 8<br>2. Next, we need to calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation: 5 # 8 = 5(8) = 40<br>3. Then, we need to calculate the Multiplication/Division (M/D) operation from left to right: 5(40) = 200<br>4. After that, we need to calculate the Addition/Subtraction (A/S) operation from left to right: 200 + 5 = 205<br>5. Finally, we need to concatenate the remaining digits: 205 @ 8 = 205(8) = 1640<br><br>The answer is 1640.<br><br>It's important to note that we need to follow the PEFMDASC order to ensure accuracy in our calculations.
