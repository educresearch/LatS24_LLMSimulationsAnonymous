      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow the rules step by step.<br><br>1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in this problem, so we can move on to the next step.<br>2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this problem, so we can move on to the next step.<br>3.

Addition and Subtraction (L to R): We have an addition operation (5 + 2), but we still need to evaluate the concatenation operation (2@4) first, since it comes before addition in the order of operations.<br>6. Concatenation (C): 2@4 = 24. So, the problem becomes 5 + 24.<br>7. Addition and Subtraction (L to R): Now, we can evaluate the addition operation 5 + 24, which equals 29.<br><br>The answer is 29.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve the expression $5 + 2 @ 4$, we need to follow the updated order of operations, which is PEFMDASC.<br><br>In this expression, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we can skip those steps. The next operation is prime factor counting (F), but there are no prime factor counting operations in our expression. Therefore, we move on to multiplication and division (M/D), but there are no multiplication or division operations in our expression either.<br><br>Next, we have addition and subtraction (A/S), and there is an addition operation in our expression, $5 + 2$. However, since concatenation (C) is listed after addition and subtraction (A/S) in the order of operations, and there is a concatenation operation in our expression, $2 @ 4$, we must perform the concatenation operation before the addition operation.<br><br>Therefore, we first calculate $2 @ 4$. The result is $24$, since the digits of $|2|$ and $|4|$ are $2$ and $4$, which are concatenated to form $24$.<br><br>Next, we perform the addition operation $5 + 24$, which gives us $29$.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{29}$.</td>

Look for Multiplication and Division (M/D), but there are none in this expression.<br>3. Now, let's look for Addition and Subtraction (A/S). We see an addition operation: 5 + 2@4. We need to perform the Concatenation (C) before continuing with the addition.<br>4. To perform Concatenation (C), join the digits of 2 and 4 together: 2 @ 4 = 24.<br>5. Now, replace the original expression 2@4 with the result 24 and continue with the Addition step: 5 + 24.<br>6. Finally, perform the Addition: 5 + 24 = 29.<br><br>The answer is 29.</td>
