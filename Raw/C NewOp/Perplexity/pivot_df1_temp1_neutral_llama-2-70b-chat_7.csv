llama-2-70b-chat,1,700,systemPrompt1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: The answer is 6.

Explanation:

1. Evaluate the prime factor counting operations from left to right:
8 # 2 = 4 (since the prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 1, and the prime factors of 2 are 2 and 1, so there are 4 shared prime factors)
6 # 6 = 6 (since the prime factors of 6 are 2, 3, and 1, and the prime factors of 6 are the same, so there are 6 shared prime factors)
2. Evaluate the addition operation:
4 + 6 = 10

Therefore, the final answer is 10."
