      <td>GPT Response: To solve the given expression 4#3 + 2 according to the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to perform prime factor counting:<br><br>1. Prime Factor Counting (F):<br>The prime factors of 4 are 2 (appears twice) and 2.<br>The prime factors of 3 are 2 and 3.<br>There is only one prime factor 2 that is common to both 4 and 3, so the prime factor counting (#) operation results in 1.<br><br>Now, since addition comes before prime factor counting in the order of operations, we can perform the addition:<br><br>The answer is 1 + 2 = 3.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Given operation: 4 # 3 + 2<br><br>Explanation:<br><br>1. Prime Factor Counting (#):<br>   Since we are performing the prime factor counting operation first, we need to find the common prime factors of |4| = 2²² and |3| = 3. Since the prime factors of 4 are 2²² and the prime factors of 3 are 3, there is no common prime factor, so the result of the prime factor counting is 0.<br><br>2.

Concatenation (C):<br>   Since we still have one more operation left to perform, which is concatenation (@), we need to evaluate the sum (2) before concatenating it with the first number (4). But in this case, since there are no more mathematical operations left, we don't need to perform concatenation at all.<br><br>In summary, since there was no need to concatenate in the given problem, our final answer does not involve any concatenation operation.
