Identify and solve any operations inside parentheses (P): In this expression, there are no operations inside parentheses.\n2. Perform exponentiation (E): In this expression, there is no exponentiation.\n3. Perform prime factor counting (F): Let's find common prime factors for the absolute values of 8 and 2 (2 and 8) and 6 and 6 (both 2 and 3). Prime factors of 2 are common in both pairs, so their count is 1.\n   - For 8 and 2: 8 # 2 = 1\n   - For 6 and 6: 6 # 6 = 1\n4. Perform division and multiplication from left to right (M/D): In this expression, there is no division or multiplication.\n5. Perform addition and subtraction from left to right (A/S): In this expression, there are two concatenation operations, but we cannot perform them yet as we still need to complete addition and subtraction. So, let's just move to the next step.\n    - There is no addition or subtraction in this expression.\n6. Perform concatenation from left to right (C): Now, we can perform the concatenation operations.\n   - For 8 # 2: The result of prime factor counting is 1, which does not affect the concatenation of the digits.

Combine the results: Since we cannot perform addition between these results directly (we must follow the order), just combine the results and leave the addition for the next step. The combined result is 82 and 66.\n8. Perform addition and subtraction from left to right (A/S): Now, we can perform the addition operation.\n   - For 82 and 66: Add the digits one by one in the sequences.\n      - Carry over 2 from the addition of 2 and 1, making it 3.\n      - Add 6 and 2, making it 8.\n      - Add 6 and 8, making it 14. With carries, it becomes 15.\n      - Subtract 1 (the number of common leading digits) from the final carry number (which is 1), giving us 0.\n9.

In this case, we have addition (A) and prime factor counting (F) in the expression. Since prime factor counting (F) comes before addition (A) in the order of operations, let's perform the prime factor counting operation first.\n\nStep 1: Perform prime factor counting (F)\n- Find unique prime factors of the absolute values of 3 and 2, which are 2 and 2, respectively.\n- Since prime factor 2 is common in both numbers, the prime factor counting operation results in 1 (since there is only 1 shared prime factor).\n\nNow that we have the result of the prime factor counting operation, we can proceed with the addition operation.\n\nStep 2: Perform addition (A)\n- Add the values of 3 and 1 (obtained from prime factor counting).\n\nThe answer is 4."}]}]
