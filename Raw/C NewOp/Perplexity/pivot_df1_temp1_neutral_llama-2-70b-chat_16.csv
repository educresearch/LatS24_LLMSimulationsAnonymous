llama-2-70b-chat,1,700,systemPrompt3,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: The given problem is 5 + 2 @ 4.

According to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses first, then the exponents, followed by the prime factor counting, multiplication and division, addition and subtraction, and finally, the concatenation.

In this case, we have 2 @ 4, which is a concatenation operation. However, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first.

The expression 2 @ 4 can be simplified as follows:

2 @ 4 = 2 @ (3 + 1)

We need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first:

3 + 1 = 4

Therefore, we have:

2 @ 4 = 2 @ 4

Now, we can proceed with the concatenation operation:

2 @ 4 = 24

Explanation:

In the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting operations first, then the addition.

8 # 2 = 0, since there are no shared prime factors between 8 and 2.
6 # 6 = 1, since there is only one shared prime factor, 3, between 6 and 6.

Therefore, the expression becomes:

0 + 1 = 1
