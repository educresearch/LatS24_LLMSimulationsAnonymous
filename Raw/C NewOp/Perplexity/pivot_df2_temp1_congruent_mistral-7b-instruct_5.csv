mistral-7b-instruct,1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: According to the expanded order of operations PEFMDASC, the first step is to perform prime factor counting (F):

Since the given expression is 4 # 3 + 2, we need to find the unique prime factors shared by |4| and |3|, and |4| and |2| separately.

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, which is shared between 2 instances in 4 and once in 2. So the count is 2.

The prime factors of 3 are 3 and 3 (since 3 is a prime number), and it is shared once in both 3 and 1 instance in 2. So the count is 1.

Thus, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 2, and we can now proceed to the addition part (S):

2 + 2 = 4.

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 4.","GPT Response: To solve the given Mathematics problem 4 # 3 + 2 using the newly introduced mathematical operations and updated order of operations, we'll follow the revised order: PEFMDASC.

First, let's handle the parentheses and exponents (in this problem, there are none). Next, we proceed with prime factor counting (F):

4 # 3
Since there are no negative numbers or shared prime factors, the result is 0 (as per the example (d)).

Now, we move to multiplication and division (M/D): there are none in this problem.

Next, addition and subtraction (A/S): we only have an addition operation (3 + 2). We need to evaluate it before concatenation:

3 + 2 = 5

Finally, concatenation (C): since the result of the addition (5) is combined with 4 (the first number in the concatenation operation), we get:

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Based on the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, for the given expression 4 # 3 + 2, we first need to perform prime factor counting before addition:

1. Perform prime factor counting with 4 and 3: 4 # 3 = 0 (since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3).
2. Since there is no prime factor counting involved between 4, 3, and 2 in the addition part of the expression, we directly perform the addition: 0 + 2 = 2.
3. Finally, since concatenation is the last operation in the order, we perform the concatenation of ""0"" and ""2"": ""0"" @ ""2"" = ""02"".

But we've made a mistake here since concatenation of two digits doesn't affect the numerical value. To rectify this, let's just show the numerical value of the solution instead of the concatenation:

The answer is 2. (This is the correct numerical value of the given expression.)

Keep in mind that the new concatenation operation can be ignored while performing arithmetic computations since it only represents the merging of digits, without any actual effect on the numerical value. In practice, we focus on the numerical value rather than the digits converted by concatenation.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, follow the steps below:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): First, we need to find the prime factor count for 4 and 3. Since 4 = 2Â² * 2 * 1 and 3 = 3, we only have one shared prime factor which is 2 with a count of 2. So the result of the prime factor counting operation is 2.
2. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Next, we evaluate the addition part of the expression, 3 + 2. The answer to this operation is 5.
3. Concatenation (C): Since we have the results of prime factor counting and addition, we can now perform the concatenation operation. In this case, we concatenate the results 2 and 5. The answer is 25.

So the calculation goes as follows:
```
2 (prime factor count of 4 and 3)
5 (result of addition part of the expression 3 + 2)
```
The answer is 25."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow the given sequence:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Since there is a # (Prime Factor Counting) operation present between the addition (+) symbols, we need to perform prime factor counting first.
2. In this problem, the prime factor counting operation is between the numbers 3 and 2, so we need to find the unique prime factors shared by |3| and |2|. The prime factor of 3 is 3, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. There is only one shared prime factor, 2. So, 3 # 2 = 1.
3. Addition (A): After performing the prime factor counting, we need to add the numbers 5 and 3 (from the original problem), which were kept aside before performing the prime factor counting.

So, the final calculation is: 1 + 5 = 6.

The answer is 6.","GPT Response: According to the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to perform prime factor counting before addition. Since the prime factor counting operation between 3 and 2 results in 0, there are no shared prime factors. Therefore, we move on to the addition operation. The addition of 5 and 3 results in 8. So the solution is:

The answer is 8.","GPT Response: Given problem: 5 + 3#2

Solution:

According to the updated order of operations, we need to follow the sequence: Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting, Multiplication & Division (from left to right), Addition & Subtraction (from left to right), and Concatenation (from left to right).

However, in this problem, there are no parentheses, exponents, or multiplication involved. So our sequence simplifies to: Prime Factor Counting (F), Addition & Subtraction (A/S), Concatenation (C).

Let's evaluate Prime Factor Counting first:
3#2 = 3 (as per the examples, the count of unique prime factors shared between 3 and 2 is 0).

Since there is no multiplication or division, let's go directly to Addition & Subtraction:
5 + 3 = 8

Lastly, there's no need for Concatenation either.

So, we have 3 (from prime factor counting) + 8 (from addition) which equals 11.

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Step 1: Evaluate prime factor counting (F). In this case, the prime factor counting operation is applied to the numbers 3 and 2. Three prime factors for 3 are 3, and for 2 is 2. Since there is only one prime factor that is common between 3 and 2, the result of this operation is 1. So, 3 # 2 = 1.

Step 2: Evaluate addition and subtraction (A/S). Here we have 5 + 1 (from step 1, the result of 3 # 2). We follow the left-to-right rule as per the updated order, so we first evaluate the number inside the parentheses: 1. Then we perform the addition: 5 + 1 = 6.

So, following the PEFMDASC order of operations, the intermediate steps for the given problem would be as follows:

1. Prime factor counting: 3 # 2 = 1
2. Addition (5 + 1): 5 + 1 = 6

Therefore, the answer is 6."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression with the new order of operations, we need to follow the PEFMDASC rule:

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in the expression.
2. Exponents: None.
3. Prime Factor counting (F): Again, there are no exponents or parentheses that need to be evaluated before prime factor counting. So we proceed to the next step. Since the operands of the concatenation operation ' @ ' are integers 5, 2 and 4. Prime factor count of 5, 2 and 4 are {2, 1, 2}, {2, 1} and {2, 2} respectively. The count of unique prime factors shared by any pair of numbers is the Intersection of their prime factor lists counted with multiplicity. Since Intersection of {2,1,2}, {2,1} and {2,2} is an empty set. Therefore, prime factor counting operation returns 0.
4. Multiplication and Division (M and D): None in the expression.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A and S): The expression contains only addition and concatenation operations. Since addition should be done before concatenation as per PESMDASC rule, we will perform the addition first.
6. Concatenation (C): The addition operation '+' between 5 and 2 gives us a result of 7. The concatenation operation '@' between 7 and 4 is then performed to get the final answer.

So, following the new order of operations, the expression 5 + 2 @ 4, is equal to:

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: In order to solve this problem using the newly introduced mathematical operations and the updated order of operations, follows these steps:

1. Identify the operations: The given expression has two operations: concatenation (@) and addition (+).

2. Determine the order of operations: According to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to evaluate addition before concatenation.

3. Solve the addition first: 5 + 2 = 7

4. Now, perform concatenation: Since we have the result of the addition, we can perform concatenation. 7 @ 4

5. The final answer: The answer is 74.

So the expression 5+2 @ 4 equals 74.","GPT Response: To solve the problem 5 + 2 @ 4, we first need to follow the updated order of operations: PEFMDASC.

1. Parentheses: None in this problem.
2. Exponents: None in this problem.

   Therefore, the final answer is 7@4.

So, The answer is 74.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 5+2 @ 4 using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), follow these steps:

3. Prime Factor Counting (F): Since this operation is not applicable to the given expression, we move on to the next operation.

4. Multiplication and Division (M): There is no multiplication or division in this expression, so we move on to the next operation.

5. Addition and Subtraction (A): Addition is present in the expression (5 +), so we will perform that operation first.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: Based on the newly updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to deal with the operations inside the parentheses:

1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: (14 + 4) = 18

Now we can proceed with the given mathematical problem:

1. Concatenation (C): 6 @ 18
= 618 (concatenating the digits of 6 and 18)

2. Prime Factor Counting (F): # 6, 18
Since the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and those of 18 are 2, 2, and 3, we have 2 shared prime factors. So, the prime factor counting operation is 2.

3. Addition (A): 0 + 12
= 12

4. Subtraction (S): 618 - 12
= 606

5. Concatenation (C): 606 @ 3
= 60603 (concatenating the digits of 606 and 3)

The final answer is 6182 (since the result of Step 1 was 18, and the result of Step 5 was 61803, we need to concatenate these two results):

The answer is 6182.","GPT Response: According to the revised order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to resolve any operations inside parentheses (P). In this case, we have (14 + 4). We perform addition inside the parentheses (M), so we get 18.

Next, we move on to prime factor counting (F), but since both operands (6 and 18) are single digits, their prime factorizations are already known. The number 6 has a prime factor count of 1 since its only prime factor is 2 (which appears twice), and 18 has a prime factor count of 2 since its prime factorization consists of the prime numbers 2 and 3 (which appear multiple times, thus counted as two). Since 6 and 18 do not share any prime factors, the prime factor counting (#) results in a value of 0.

Finally, we perform the concatenation (C) operation. We follow the left-to-right concatenation rule, so we first concatenate 6 and the result from prime factor counting (0), getting 6. Then we concatenate 6 and the result from addition (18), which gives the final answer:

The answer is 60.","GPT Response: To solve the given expression with the updated mathematical operations and order of operations, follow these steps:

1. First, apply the order of operations (Parentheses (P) come first):
   (14 + 4) => 18

2. Next step is Prime Factor Counting (F), but in this case, since there is no common factor between the numbers 6 and 18, the result of the prime factor count is 0.

3. Now move on to Multiplication and Division (M/D) from left to right:
   6 @ 18 = 618

4. Then come Addition and Subtraction (A/S) from left to right:
   618 + 12 = 629

5. Lastly, we apply Concatenation (C):
   629

So the answer is 629.","GPT Response: Step 1: Parentheses
We have parentheses in the expression, so we'll evaluate them first:

14 + 4 = 18

Step 2: Exponents
We don't have any exponents in the expression, so we'll move on to the next operation.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
To calculate the prime factor counting (F), we need to find the common prime factors of |6| and |18|, which are 2 and 3. Since there are 2 unique shared prime factors, the prime factor count is 2.

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D, left to right)
We don't have any multiplication or division signs in the expression yet, so we'll move on to the next operation.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S, left to right)
We have two addition and one subtraction signs. We'll evaluate them from left to right:

a) Evaluate 6 @ 18
Since we need to evaluate addition before concatenation, we'll first calculate 18 + 6 = 24.

b) Now, we can perform the concatenation: 6 @ 24 = 624.

c) Now, let's evaluate subtraction: 12 - 2 = 10.

Step 6: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Since we've completed all other operations, we can now perform the prime factor counting between |6| and |3|, but they were already provided in the problem: |6| = 2 Ã 2 Ã 3 and |3| = 3. Since they share the prime factor 3, the prime factor count is 1.

Step 7: Concatenation (C)
Now that we've completed all the necessary operations in the given order, we can perform the final concatenation: 624 # 1 = 624.
