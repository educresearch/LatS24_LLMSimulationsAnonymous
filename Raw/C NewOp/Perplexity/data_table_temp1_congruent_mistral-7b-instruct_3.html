      <td>GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, follow these steps:<br><br>1. First, perform the prime factor counting (F) between the absolute values of the numbers 4 and 3:<br>   Since prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 and prime factors of 3 are 3, there are no shared prime factors. So, the prime factor counting is 0.<br><br>2. Next, since there is neither multiplication nor division in this expression, we move on to addition and subtraction (AS):<br>   We have 2 operations in the order given: '+' and '#'. According to the order of operations given (PEFMDASC), we should perform concatenation (C) before addition (AS). However, in this case, both operations are different, so we cannot directly follow the order, and we should break the rule, as the expression uses addition and not concatenation.<br><br>3. So, we perform the addition (AS): <br>   4 + 2 = 6<br><br>4. Now that we have the result of the addition, we perform the concatenation (C) operation:<br>    Since we added 2 and 4 to get 6, we have 6. However, according to the rules of concatenation given (there is no number '6' representation in the given examples), the digits of the numbers 4 and 3 are concatenated together, which is 43.<br><br>5. Finally, since there are no more operations left, the answer using the PEFMDASC order is: The answer is 43.<br><br>Note: Although we had to break the rule of performing concatenation before addition in this specific problem due to the nature of the given expression, the main idea behind following PEFMDASC order is to ensure a consistent and clear evaluation order throughout any mathematical expression.</td>

Prime Factor Counting (F): To find the prime factors common to 6 and 14, we have {2, 2, 2, 7} and {2, 7}, so we have one shared prime factor, 2, which gives us a count of 1.
