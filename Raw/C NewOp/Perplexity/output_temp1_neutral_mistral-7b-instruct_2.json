Prime factor counting (F): If we calculate the prime factor count for 2 (only prime factor is 2, so count is 1), then for 3 (only prime factor is 3, so count is 1), and then for their product 2 # 3: since there is no shared prime factor between 2 and 3, the prime factor count is 0. However, we will encounter this operation later in the expression, so for now, we record the result, which is 0.\n2. Multiplication and Division (M/D): We don't have any multiplication or division operations.\n3. Exponents: None present.\n4. Parentheses (P): We don't have any parentheses.\n5.
