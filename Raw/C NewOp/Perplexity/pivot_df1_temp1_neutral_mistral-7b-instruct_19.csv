mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression with the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to identify which operations need to be performed before the others:

1. Concatenation (C) comes last since it's a combining operation.
2. Prime Factor Counting (F) comes before multiplication and division (M and D).
3. Addition (A) and subtraction (S) come before concatenation (C).

Considering the given expression as 5 + 2 @ 4, we have the following steps:

1. Addition (A): Since this is before concatenation, evaluate 5 + 2 = 7.
2. Concatenation (C): Now calculate 7 @ 4 = 74.

So, the answer is 74.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression with the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to identify which operations fall into each category. In this expression, we have prime factor counting (#) and concatenation (@) operations.

Given expression: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Now, let's apply the order of operations:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): We calculate the prime factor counts for each number individually before performing any addition or concatenation.

a. For 8: The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2, 2.
b. For 2: The prime factor of 2 is 2.
c. For 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2, 3.

2. Addition (A): Since there is no explicit parentheses or exponentiation in this expression, we directly evaluate the addition without considering any preceding operations.

So, now we have 0 + prime factor count of 8 + prime factor count of 6. Based on our examples and calculations above:

1. Prime factor count of 8: Since the prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2, 2, there is a total of 4 unique prime factors, so prime factor count of 8 is 4.
2. Prime factor count of 6: Since the prime factors of 6 are 2, 3, there are 2 unique prime factors, so prime factor count of 6 is 2.
3. Addition: Adding the prime factor counts: 4 + 2 = 6.

So, the final answer is:

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem using the expanded order of operations (PEFMDASC), we follow these steps:

1. Parentheses: Solve what is inside the parentheses first:
   = 14 + 4
   = 18

2. Prime Factor Counting (F): Calculate the count of unique prime factors shared by the digits of 6 and the result of the addition (18):
   For number 6, the unique prime factors are 2 and 3.
   For number 18, the unique prime factors are 2, 3, and 3.
   Since there are two prime factors '3' among them, they have 1 shared prime factor.
   So, the result of the prime factor counting operation (F) is 1.

3. Concatenation (C): Since we don't have any exponentiation, exponents, or division/multiplication at this moment, we can directly perform the concatenation operation:
   = 6 @ 18
   = 618

4. Addition and Subtraction (AS): Previously we calculated the addition inside the parentheses, but now we need to perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
   = 618 + 12

In this expression, we first encounterWith the given expression is 5 + 2 @ 4, we see that there are no parentheses, so we move on to the next operation:

1. Exponents (none in this expression)
2. Prime Factor Counting: None, as we only have numbers and the @ symbol in this expression.
3. Multiplication and Division (MD): None, as there is no multiplication or division sign in this expression.
4. Addition and Subtraction (AS): We have an addition sign (+) and two numbers, but no other arithmetic operations, so we evaluate the addition: 

5 + 2 = 7.

5. Concatenation (C): The last symbol we encounter in the expression is the @ symbol, which represents concatenation. Since we have already evaluated all other operations, we now perform the concatenation:

Since there are no digits before the @ symbol, we take the digits of both 2 and 4 and concatenate them as follows:

4 @ 2 = 42.

1. Parentheses: None in this problem, so we move to the next operation.
2. Exponents: None in this problem, so we move to the next operation.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): Since there are no negative numbers or complex expressions, we can directly calculate the prime factor counting operations. We have two pairs of numbers: 8 and 2, and 6 and 6. Let's calculate the prime factor counts for each pair:
   a. For 8 and 2, the prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2 (twice), and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since there is at least one shared prime factor, we have 1 for the prime factor count (F) for the first pair.
   b. For 6 and 6, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 (twice), and the prime factors of 6 are also 2 and 3 (twice). Since we have two shared prime factors, we have 2 for the prime factor count (F) for the second pair.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): We don't have any multiplication or division operations, so we move to the next operation.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Since there are no parentheses or exponents, we can directly perform the addition operation (since prime factor counting is done before addition). We have two addition operations: adding the prime factor counts (F) from each pair and adding the numbers that did not undergo the prime factor counting operation. First, we calculate the prime factor counts for both pairs (1 + 2 = 3 and 0 + 2 = 2), then we add the numbers (8 and 6) that did not undergo the prime factor counting operation.

1. Prime Factor Counting (#): There is no prime factorization involved since both numbers are single digits, and there are no negative numbers.

2. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There is no multiplication or division in the expression at the moment.

3. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): The only operators left are addition (+' ) and concatenation ( '@'). In this case, since there is an addition sign, A/S comes before concatenation (C).

So the order of operations for the calculation becomes A > C.

Let's apply this order of operations to the expression: 5 + 2 @ 4

1. Perform addition (A): 5 + 2 = 7
2. Apply concatenation (C): The result will be a single value due to no prime factors overlapping; however, based on the problem's structure, I'd interpret this as 7 and then '2' concatenated. So the value becomes 72.

3. Prime Factor Counting: 4 has two 2's as prime factors, and 3 has no common prime factors with 4, so the prime factor counting operation results in 0.

4. Multiplication and Division: We don't have any multiplication or division operations in this problem, so we move on to the next step.

5. Addition and Subtraction: We have only addition and subtraction in the problem. Since `+` operates before `@`, we first perform the addition operation:

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
First, we'll perform the prime factor counting (#) operation between the given numbers. In this case, we have 8 and 6.

8 = 2³ * 2
6 = 2² * 2 * 3

To find the shared prime factors, we'll identify the common prime factors in the prime factorizations of both numbers:

1. Both 2 is present in both prime factorizations.
2. No other common prime factors exist.

Since there is 1 shared prime factor, the result of performing 8 # 6 will be 1.

Step 2: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Now, since we have two results of the prime factor counting operation, we'll perform addition between these results: 1 + 1 = 2.

Finally, we'll add the prime factor counting results to the 6 from the original expression: 1 + 1+ 6 = 8.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: Step 1: Parentheses
The first step in the PEFMDASC order is to deal with any expressions inside parentheses. In this problem, we have (14 + 4). So, let's calculate that first:

14 + 4 = 18

Step 2: Prime factor counting (#)
The second step is prime factor counting (#). However, since the given numbers are in the range of small integers, it is easy to see that none of the numbers have common prime factors. So, prime factor counting will result in 0 for each calculation. In other cases, you should calculate the unique prime factors of the absolute values and count their occurrences to find the result. In this case, since the result of each step is 0, we can easily move on to the next step.

Step 3: Exponents (No exponents in this problem)

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
No multiplication or division operations are present in this problem.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
We now have addition and subtraction operations: 6 @ (18) + 12 - 2. Since addition comes before subtraction:
