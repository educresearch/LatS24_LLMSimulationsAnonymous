Parentheses: There are no parentheses, so we move on to the next step.<br>2. Exponents: None present, so we move on to the next step.<br>3. Prime Factor counting (F): 2@4 is a concatenation operation, not a multiplication. Prime factor counting does not apply here.<br>4. Multiplication and Division (M and D): None present, so we move on to the next step.<br>5. Addition and Subtraction (A and S): <br>We are at the addition sign (+). However, before performing the addition, we need to evaluate 2@4 which is a concatenation operation.<br><br>6. Concatenation (C): 2@4 = 25<br><br>Now, we go back to the step for addition:<br><br>5 + 25<br><br>The answer is 30.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve the problem 5 + 2@4, we need to follow the revised order of operations, which is PEFMDASC:<br><br>1. Parentheses: In this case, there are no parentheses, so we move on to the next operation.<br>2. Exponents: There are no exponents, so we move on to the next operation.<br>3. Prime Factor Counting (F): This is not applicable as we are dealing with addition and concatenation.<br>4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): We see that there is no multiplication sign but there is a "@" symbol for concatenation, which is a newer operation. Concatenation is the operation below multiplication in the order of operations. Therefore, we move on to the next operation.<br>5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We here have an addition sign and one digit 2 and the "@" symbol representing concatenation with the digit 4. Since addition is the operation below concatenation, we need to first perform the addition: 5 + 2 = 7.<br>6.

      <td>GPT Response: To solve the given expression with the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to identify which operations need to be performed first.<br><br>1. Since there are no parentheses or exponents, we move on to the next steps.<br>2. Prime factor counting (F) comes before any arithmetic operations, so let's find the common prime factors of the given numbers:<br>   - Prime factors of 5: 5<br>   - Prime factors of 3: 3<br>   - Prime factors of 2: 2<br>3. However, prime factor counting (#) is an operation that only yields zeros or natural numbers as results. In this case, 5 and 3 share no common prime factors; hence, their prime factor counting is zero (0).<br>4. Now, we have two arithmetic operations, and since both multiplication and division have the same precedence (L to R), and addition and subtraction also have the same precedence (L to R), we move on to the next operation based on their positions, which is:<br>   - Addition (A) comes before concatenation (C).<br>5. Therefore, we evaluate 5 + 3 before concatenating the digits of the absolute values of the numbers.<br><br>So, the calculation is: 5 + 3 = 8 (since 5 and 3 do not have any common prime factors, there is no need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation before addition).<br><br>The answer is 8.</td>

Identify the order of operations: Parentheses (none), Exponents (none), Prime Factor Counting (#), Multiplication and Division (M/D), Addition and Subtraction (A/S), Concatenation (C)<br>2. Perform Prime Factor Counting (#): Since there is only one # symbol, perform this operation first:<br><br>- The prime factorization of 2 is just 2. The prime factorization of 3 is 3, and of 5 is 5.<br>- Since 2 and 3 share 1 prime factor (2), the count is 1. So, 5 # 3 = 1.<br>- The prime factorization of 2 is 2.<br>- The prime factorization of 5 is 5.<br>- Since there are no shared prime factors, the count for 2 and 5 is 0. Therefore, 2 # 5 = 0.<br><br>3. Perform Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Since there are no parentheses, operation symbols or =, the A/S part is empty for this expression.<br><br>4. Perform Multiplication and Division (M/D): Since there are no multiplication or division symbols, the M/D part is empty for this expression.<br><br>5. Perform Concatenation (C): Since there are no @ symbols, the C part is empty for this expression.<br><br>6. Perform the remaining operations in their original order:<br>- In our given expression, we only have the addition (5 + 3) and the prime factor counting operation (#). However, we cannot perform addition until after we've done prime factor counting according to the order of operations. Since the prime factor counting has already been done and the result is 1, we can now add 5 and 3:<br><br>The answer is 8.</td>
