The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Hence, they share one prime factor, so 8 # 2 = 1.

Similarly, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 6 are all 2, 3. Hence, they share two prime factors, so 6 # 6 = 2.

                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

Since there is no shared prime factor between 4 and 3, 4 # 3 = 0.

According to this order, we should perform Prime Factor Counting (F) before Addition (A).

First, let's calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) for 8#2:

The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2.
The prime factors of 2 are 2.
Since these expressions share 1 prime factor (2), 8#2 equals 1.

Next, let's calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) for 6#6:

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
These expressions share 2 prime factors (2 and 3), so 6#6 equals 2.

Finally, add the results of Prime Factor Counting (F):

1 (8#2) + 2 (6#6) = 3

The answer is 3."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:

                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1.

2. We now look for Addition and Subtraction (A/S) operations. There is an addition operation in the given expression: 5 + 2. We perform this operation first:

5 + 2 = 7

1. After performing the addition, we now have the original expression with only the Concatenation (C) operation remaining:

7 @ 4

Concatenation (C) means joining the digits of the two numbers together. In this case, we simply attach the digit 4 to the number 7, since there is no digit to be attached to the right side of 4.

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2

Step 2: Perform the Concatenation operation (C).
(Note: Concatenation is done from left to right.)

6 @ 18 = 618
So, 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 = 618 + 12 - 2

Step 3: Perform the Addition and Subtraction operations (A/S).
(Note: They are performed from left to right.)
618 + 12 - 2 = 630 - 2

Step 4: Continue with the Addition and Subtraction operations (A/S).
630 - 2 = 628

Step 5: The final step is to perform the Prime Factor Counting operation (F) with #.
However, there are no instances of the Prime Factor Counting operation (#) in the given expression. So, you don't need to perform any further calculations.

The answer is 628."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together.

                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
