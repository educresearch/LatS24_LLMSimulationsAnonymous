In this case, there are none.\n\n1. Prime Factor Counting (F): We start with the prime factor counting operation since it comes before multiplication and division. For the first number, 8, the prime factors are 2 and 2. For the second number, 2, it already is a prime number, so the count of unique prime factors is 1. Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1.\n\n2. Prime Factor Counting (F): Now we perform the prime factor count for the second operator, #, between the results of the previous step, 1, and 6. The prime factors of 1 are empty since 1 is a prime number. For 6, the prime factors are 2 and 2 and 3. Since there are no common prime factors (2 and 3 are not the same), the count of unique prime factors shared between 1 and 6 is 0. Therefore, 1 # 6 = 0.\n\n3. Concatenation (C): Since there is a @ symbol, we perform the concatenation operation next. We have the results from the prime factor count steps: 1 and 0. Since we can only concatenate numbers with digits, we convert 1 and 0 into 1 and 0 with digits. So, 1 @ 0 = 01.\n\n4. Addition and Subtraction (AS): We now perform the addition operation since it comes before multiplication. Here we have: 6 # 6 # 1 @ 0 + 2. The addition of 6 and 0 is 6, and 6 # 6 equals 1 (as previously calculated). So, we have 1 @ 6 + 6 = 1 @ 12 = 12 (since there is no prime factor count operation between concatenation and addition).\n\n5. Multiplication and Division (MD): We perform the multiplication and division operations, being sure that we do them from left to right.
