First, there are no parentheses or exponents in this problem, so we proceed to prime factor counting. However, 2@4 is a concatenation, not a number, so we can't do prime factor counting on it. Therefore, we need to perform the concatenation first.

5 + 2@4 = 5 + 24 = 5 + 20 (because 2@4 = 24 by concatenating the digits of 2 and 4)

Now, we have addition and a number, so we can proceed to addition in the order of operations.

5 + 20 = 25

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 25."

6 # 6 = 2 (since the prime factors for 6 are 2 and 3, and it has 1 shared prime factor with itself)

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

First, perform the operation inside the parentheses:

Next, calculate the prime factor counting operation:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Now, handle the concatenation operation:

618 + 12 - 0

                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)

                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

The prime factors of the absolute values of 2 and 4 are:

So, first, we find the Prime Factor Counting (F) for both 8 # 2 and 6 # 6:

8 # 2 = 2 and 2 # 2 = 1 (since 8 has prime factors of 2 and 2 has one prime factor 2, thus shared prime factor is 1)
6 # 6 = 1 (since 6 has prime factors of 2 and 3, which are not common)

Now, replace 8 # 2 and 6 # 6 in the original expression, resulting in 2 + 1.
Following the LTR (left-to-right) rule of Addition (A), you get:

2 + 1 = 3

Therefore,

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

To do this, we first find the prime factors of the absolute values of the numbers involved, which are 5, 3, and 2.
The prime factors of 5 are 5.
The prime factors of 3 are 3.
The prime factors of 2 are 2.
There are no shared prime factors between 5 and 3, nor between 5 or 3 and 2. So, 5 # 3 = 0.
