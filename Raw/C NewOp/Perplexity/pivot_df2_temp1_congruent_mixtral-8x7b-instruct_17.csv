4. Multiplication and Division (left to right)
5. Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
6. Concatenation (C)

In this problem, there are no parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, or concatenation operations. So, we start with Prime Factor counting (F):

1. Calculate 2 # 4: The prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 4 are 2. So, there is 1 shared prime factor (2), and thus, 2 # 4 = 1.
