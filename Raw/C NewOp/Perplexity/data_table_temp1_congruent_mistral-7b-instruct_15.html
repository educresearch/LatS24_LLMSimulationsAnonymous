      <td>GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to perform prime factor counting (F). In this case, the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and there are no common prime factors between 4 and 3 or between 4 and 2. Thus, the result of 4 # 3 and 4 # 2 is both 0.<br><br>Now, we need to perform the addition operation (A). So, 3 + 2 equals 5.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is:<br><br>The answer is 0 (since 4 # 3 and 4 # 2 both equaled 0, and 0 is the result of performing the addition operation on those results).</td>
      <td>GPT Response: According to the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), prime factor counting (F) should be evaluated before addition (A). Therefore, we should first determine the result of the prime factor counting operation between the given numbers 4 and 3.<br><br>Since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3, there is no shared prime factor. So, the prime factor counting result is 0.<br><br>Now, we can evaluate the addition (A) operation. Since the numbers are small, we can simply add them directly: 4 + 3 = 7.<br><br>Applying the final operation, concatenation (C), between the result of the addition (7) and the original number 2, we get: 7 @ 2 = 72.<br><br>So, the final step in our calculation is the concatenation between the result of the previous operations (addition) and the last number provided in the original expression.<br><br>Thus, the solution to the problem 4 # 3 + 2 is 72.<br><br>The answer is __72__.</td>

In this case, there's no @ sign present, but we have to consider the hollow circles representing empty slots for the missing digits.<br><br>Since we don't have enough information to concatenate the current digits, the result is undefined for concatenation.<br><br>Therefore, we cannot provide a final answer for this problem. The expression 4 # 3+2 is undefined because prime factor counting has reulted in 0, and the expression cannot be concatenated without the provided digits to merge.</td>

However, since prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, prime factors of 3 are 3, and prime factors of 2 are 2, there is only one shared prime factor 2. So, 4 # 3 = 1.<br><br>So far, we have:<br>1 (result of the prime factor counting)<br><br>2. Addition (+):<br>Next, we perform the addition operation: 1 + 2 = 3.<br><br>The answer is 3.</td>
