According to the provided order of operations (PEFMDASC), the first operation to perform is prime factor counting.\n\nFirst, we calculate the prime factor counts for each number:\n8 = 2^3, 2 # 8 = 3\n2 is not a prime number, so its prime factors are 2 and 2 = 2, and since we're looking for unique prime factors in the shared count, we have 1 prime factor in common, i.e., a prime factor count of 1 for both numbers.\n\nNext is the concatenation operation. However, concatenation should be done only after addition has been completed. Company policy states that the addition in this problem must be done first. Thus, to comply, we will carry out the addition operation before concatenation.\n\nNow, we perform the addition: 6 # 2 = 1, 1 + 6 = 7.\n\nFinally, we apply concatenation to the result: 7 @ 8 = 78.\n\nThe answer is __.\n78."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt2_userPrompt3_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700", "model": "mistral-7b-instruct", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 700, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "Introduction of New Mathematical Operations and Updated Order of Operations\n                    Mathematics has recently introduced two novel operations:\n\n                    Concatenation (C): This operation, denoted as a @ b, represents the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. \n                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):\n                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.\n                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.\n                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.\n                    \n                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Represented as a # b, this operation counts the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of a and b. \n                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):\n                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1\n                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) \n                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. \n                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)\n                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. \n                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)\n                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.\n                    \n                    The order of operations has been revised to PEFMDASC, representing:\n\n                    P: Parentheses\n                    E: Exponents\n                    F: Prime Factor counting\n                    M/D: Multiplication and Division (left to right)\n                    A/S: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)\n                    C: Concatenation (left to right)\n                    \n                    Important Examples Demonstrating New Operations and Order:\n                    (i) 5 @ 3 + 6\n                    = 5 @ 9 (since we need to evaluate addition before concatenation)\n                    = 59\n\n                    (ii) 5 # 3 + 6\n                    = 0 + 6 (since we need to evaluate prime factorization before addition)\n                    = 6\n\n                    (iii) 5 - 3 @ 6\n                    = 2 @ 6 (since we need to evaluate subtraction before concatenation)\n                    = 26\n\n                    (iv) 5 - 3 # 6\n                    = 5 - 1 (since we need to evaluate prime factorization before subtraction)\n                    = 4\n\n                    (vi) (3 + 10 # 2) * 5 @ 42 \n                    = (3 + 1) * 5 @ 42 (we need to evaluate what is in the parenthesis first and prime factor counting is before addition)\n                    = 4 * 5 @ 42  (we need to evaluate multiplication before concatenation\n                    = 20 @ 42 = 2042.
