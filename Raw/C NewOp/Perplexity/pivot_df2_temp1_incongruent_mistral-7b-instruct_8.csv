mistral-7b-instruct,1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: Based on the updated order of operations, the solution to the problem 4#3 + 2 would be as follows:

First, we need to perform the prime factor counting operation between 4 and 3. Since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3, there is no shared prime factor, so the prime factor counting operation results in 0.

Therefore, according to the expanded order of operations PEFMDASC, since prime factor counting (F) comes before addition (S), the answer would be 0.

The answer is __0__.","GPT Response: According to the given order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to first perform prime factor counting, as it appears before addition (A) in the order. In this case, both the numbers 4 and 3 have only one prime factor, which is 2. Since there is only one shared prime factor, the prime factor counting operation (#) returns a value of 1.

Now that we have the value of the prime factor counting operation, we can move on to the addition (A) of the numbers 1 (the result of the prime factor counting between 4 and 3) and 2. So, the final answer is:

The answer is 1 + 2 = 3.","GPT Response: Given expression: 4 # 3 + 2

Explanation:
1. First, we need to perform prime factor counting (#), according to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:
   4: Prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2
   3: Prime factors of 3 are 3
   Common prime factors: None (since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3)
   Therefore, 4 # 3 = 0.

2. Since the expression has only addition (+), we can now proceed to perform addition, also according to the updated order of operations:
   We first add 4 and 3: 7
   We then add the result to 2: 9.

Answer: The answer is 9.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 4#3 + 2 using the PEFMDASC order, we follow these steps:

1. Prime factor counting (F): California the unique prime factors of the absolute values of 4 (2 x 2) and 3 (2 x 3). Since there is 1 shared prime factor, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 2.
2. Addition and Subtraction (AS): Since there is no addition or subtraction inside parentheses or in a higher priority operation, we proceed with performing the given addition.
So, the result of the addition operation is: 2 (from step 1) + 2 = 4.

The answer is 4."

The answer is 31.","GPT Response: To solve the given Mathematics problem using the newly introduced mathematical operations and the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), follow these steps:

1. Identify the operations: In this expression, we have the concatenation operation '@' between the number 2 and 4.

2. Apply the updated order of operations: Since 'P' (parentheses) is not applicable here, we move on to 'E' (exponents). We don't have any exponents in our expression.

3. Next in line is 'F' (prime factor counting), but there is no prime factor counting operation present in our expression.

4. Next comes 'M/D' (multiplication and division), but we don't have any multiplication or division operations here.

5. Followed by 'A/S' (addition and subtraction): Our final operation in the given expression is '+' (addition) and it operates on the numbers 5 and 2@4. Since 'C' (concatenation) has a higher precedence than 'A' (addition) according to the updated order of operations, we need to first perform the concatenation of 2 and 4. This results in the number 24.

6. Now, we can perform the '+' operation, which adds 5 to the number 24.

Therefore, the solution to the problem 5 + 2@4 is as follows:

First, perform the concatenation operation: 2@4 = 24
Then, perform the addition operation: 5 + 24 = 29

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: To solve the problem 5 + 2@4, we need to follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC. Since there are no parentheses or exponents, we start with the next operation in line, which is concatenation (C). But in this case, there is no need for concatenation as we are dealing with numbers and not digits.

Next, we have prime factor counting (F). When evaluating prime factors of 2 and 4, we can see that they both share the prime factor 2 with a count of 1 for each number. So, 2#4=1.

However, our operation now is addition (A), and sinceprime factor counting (F) comes before addition (A) in the updated order of operations, we cannot perform the addition (A) directly. So, we must perform the prime factor counting (F) first, and in this case, the result is 1.

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: Given expression: 5 + 3 # 2

Following the revised order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in the expression, so we move on to the next operation.

2. Exponents: None present, moving on.

3. Prime Factor counting (F): We have 3 numbers: 5, 3, and 2. To calculate, we find the prime factors of the absolute values of each number and count the number of shared prime factors.

For 5, prime factors are 5.
For 3, prime factors are 3.
For 2, prime factors are 2.

There is only one shared prime factor (2). So, the Prime Factor counting (F) operation results in 1.

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): None present, moving on.

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We have an addition operation and it comes before the concatenation operation according to the updated order.

1. Prime Factor Counting: 5 # 2
    Since the common prime factors for 5 (1, 5) and 2 (2) are not the same, the result is 0.

2. After performing Prime Factor Counting, we now have to deal with the addition operation: 5 + 3

The answer is 8.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 3 # 2 using the PEFMDASC order, we'll follow these steps:

 Before any calculations, let's determine the prime factors that the absolute values of the numbers have in common, following the order:

* For 3: Prime factors: 3.
* For 2: Prime factors: 2.

Since the prime factor 2 appears in both 3 and 2, we apply the prime factor counting operation #.

 Now, let's calculate the prime factor counting operation, which is 3 # 2 = 1 since they have one common prime factor, 2.

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
 Since there is an addition sign (+), the next operation is Addition. However, there is no addition at this moment, so we move on to the next operation.

Addition: 18

2. Prime factor counting: None in this step, so moving on to the next.

3. Exponents: None in this step, so moving on to the next.

4. Multiplication and Division (L to R): Concatenation (@) is not a multiplication or division, so we move on to the next.

5. Addition and Subtraction (L to R):
We have additions and subtraction here. However, performing subtraction before addition goes against the conventional order of operations (subtraction before addition, or SBA), which could lead to errors. To avoid this, make sure any subtraction in the expression is done inside the parentheses or as part of a more complex expression, like a negative integar. In our case, since there are no parentheses involved in our subtraction, we have an ambiguous situation. To comply with the updated rules, we need to treat concatenation as an operation lower than both subtraction and addition.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to identify which operations to apply next according to the rules.

First, we encounter # (Prime Factor Counting) and + (Addition). Since prime factor counting is before addition, we need to perform prime factor counting first.

Given numbers for prime factor counting are: 8 and 2; and 6.

For 8 and 2: prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2, and 2 (4 times). Prime factors of 2 are 2. Since 2 is a shared prime factor, the result is 1.

For 2 and 6: prime factors of 2 are 2. Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since there is only one prime factor 2 that is shared, the result is 1.

For 6 and 6: prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since no prime factor is shared, the result is 0.

Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 1 (result of 8 # 2) + 1 (result of 2+6 # 6), which equals 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the newly introduced mathematical operations and updated order of operations, we need to follow the given order: Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting (F), Multiplication and Division (M/D), Addition and Subtraction (A/S), and Concatenation (C).

Given expression: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

First, we solve the prime factor counting (F) part:
- For 8, its prime factors are 2 × 2 × 2.
- For 2, its prime factors are 2.

Since there's no shared prime factor between the prime factor sets of 8 and 2, the number of unique shared prime factors is 0 (according to the fourth key example).

Now, we move to the Addition and Subtraction (A/S) part:
- We have 0 + 6 # 6.

We cannot perform concatenation yet since we still have an addition operation to handle. Therefore, we first solve the prime factor counting operation between 6 and 6 using the third key example (since their prime factor sets are the same, the answer would be 1):

6 # 6 = 1.

Now, we proceed with the addition:
0 + 1 = 1.

So, the current state of the problem is: 8 # 2 → 0 (since there's no shared prime factor) and we now have 1.

Next, we move to the Multiplication and Division (M/D) part: we don't have any multiplication or division operations left.

Then, we perform the Concatenation (C) operation:
1 (result from A/S) @ 0 (result from F) = 10.

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 10.","GPT Response: To solve the problem with the new mathematical operations and order, we need to follow the updated order of operations: PEFMDASC.

First, let's handle the prime factor counting (#) operation:

8 # 2 = 2 (Since the prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2, 2, and the common prime factor between 8 and 2 is 2.)

6 # 2 = 0 (Since the prime factors of 6 are 2, 3, and the prime factors of 2 are just 2, and there are no shared prime factors between them.)

Now that we have handled the prime factor counting operation, we move on to the concatenation (C) operation as it follows the prime factor counting operation in the order of operations:

2 @ 6 = 26

Therefore, the solution to the problem 8 # 2 + 6 # 6, following the new updated order of operations is:

The answer is 26.","GPT Response: To solve the problem using the PEFMDASC order of operations, we first look for any parentheses. In this case, there are none.

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): We start with the prime factor counting operation since it comes before multiplication and division. For the first number, 8, the prime factors are 2 and 2. For the second number, 2, it already is a prime number, so the count of unique prime factors is 1. Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1.

2. Prime Factor Counting (F): Now we perform the prime factor count for the second operator, #, between the results of the previous step, 1, and 6. The prime factors of 1 are empty since 1 is a prime number. For 6, the prime factors are 2 and 2 and 3. Since there are no common prime factors (2 and 3 are not the same), the count of unique prime factors shared between 1 and 6 is 0. Therefore, 1 # 6 = 0.

3. Concatenation (C): Since there is a @ symbol, we perform the concatenation operation next. We have the results from the prime factor count steps: 1 and 0. Since we can only concatenate numbers with digits, we convert 1 and 0 into 1 and 0 with digits. So, 1 @ 0 = 01.

4. Addition and Subtraction (AS): We now perform the addition operation since it comes before multiplication. Here we have: 6 # 6 # 1 @ 0 + 2. The addition of 6 and 0 is 6, and 6 # 6 equals 1 (as previously calculated). So, we have 1 @ 6 + 6 = 1 @ 12 = 12 (since there is no prime factor count operation between concatenation and addition).

5. Multiplication and Division (MD): We perform the multiplication and division operations, being sure that we do them from left to right. We have: 1 @ 12 = 12 and 12 * 2 = 24.
