llama-2-70b-chat,1,700,systemPrompt4,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Sure, let's explore how to evaluate the expression 5+2 @ 4 using the updated order of operations, PEFMDASC.

Step 1: P (Parentheses)
There are no parentheses in this expression, so we can move on to the next step.

Step 2: E (Exponents)
There are no exponents in this expression, so we can move on to the next step.

Step 3: F (Prime Factor Counting)
We need to calculate the prime factor count of 5 and 2, which is 5 # 2 = 1 (since 5 has 5 as its prime factor, and 2 has 2 as its prime factor, and there is only 1 shared prime factor between them).

Step 4: M/D (Multiplication/Division, left to right)
We need to calculate 5 @ 4 = 20 (using the concatenation operation).

Step 5: A/S (Addition/Subtraction, left to right)
We need to calculate 5 + 2 = 7.

Step 6: C (Concatenation, left to right)
We need to concatenate 7 with 20, which gives us 720.

The answer is 720.

1. Parentheses: Inside the parentheses we have:

14 + 4 = 18

So, the expression inside the parentheses is 6@18.
2. Prime Factor Counting: We need to calculate 6 # 18.

6 # 18 = 6

Now, we have 6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3.
