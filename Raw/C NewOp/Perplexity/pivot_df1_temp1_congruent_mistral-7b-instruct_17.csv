4. Multiplication and Division (MD): there is no multiplication or division in this problem
5. Addition and Subtraction (AS): we need to evaluate addition and subtraction before concatenation. In this case, we only have addition.
6. Concatenation (C) : we need to perform the concatenation operation at the end.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression with the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow the given steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
   First, we need to find the number of unique prime factors shared by 8 and 2, and 6 and 6. Since 8 has prime factors 2 and 2, 2 is the only shared prime factor between 8 and 2, hence, the result of 8 # 2 is 1.
   Similarly, 6 has prime factors 2 and 3, and 2 is a shared prime factor between 6 and 6, so the result of 6 # 6 is 2.

2. Addition (A):
   Since the exponent operation (E) is not involved, we can proceed with the addition operation (A) directly: 1 + 2 = 3.

The answer is __.
So, the final answer is 3."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: The given expression is ""4 # 3 + 2"" according to the expanded order of operations PEMDASC, the first step is to perform the prime factor counting operation. In this case, the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since there is no shared prime factor, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 0.

Therefore, the expression ""4 # 3 + 2"" evaluates to 0 according to the given rules.

The answer is 0."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression using the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first focus on the operation inside the parentheses:

(14 + 4)

Now, we apply the concatenation operation to 6 and 18:

6 @ 18
= 618 (concatenation)

Next, let's perform the prime factor counting operation between 6 and 18:

6 # 18 = 1 (since the only prime factor shared between 6 and 18 is 2, but 2 is not unique and is counted as part of the absolute value representation of each number)

Finally, we perform the subtraction operation:

618 - 2 = 616

So, the answer is 616."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: Based on the expanded order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to first evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F) between the numbers 3 and 2. Since the only common prime factor between 3 and 2 is 1 (prime factor of 2 is 2 and 3 is 3, no shared prime factors), the prime factor counting operation results in 0.

Now that we have evaluated the prime factor counting operation, we are left with the addition operation (A). Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 5 + 0 = 5."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the given Mathematics problem using the newly introduced mathematical operations and the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, let's follow these steps:

1. Identify and evaluate any operations within parentheses (P), if present: In this problem, there are no parentheses.

2. Perform any exponentiation (E): There are no exponents in the given expression.

3. Perform any prime factor counting (F): There are no absolute values or fractional expressions in the given expression, so we do not need to perform prime factor counting in this case.

4. Perform any multiplication and division (M/D) from left to right: In the given expression, there is a multiplication symbol (@) between 5, 2, and 4. So, we need to find the result of 2 @ 4 before performing the addition.

5. Perform any addition and subtraction (A/S) from left to right: In the given expression, we have the addition symbol (+) between 5 and the resulting value of 2 @ 4. So, we need to calculate 2 @ 4 first, and then perform the addition.

 Using the given key examples of the concatenation operation, we have:

 2 @ 4 = 24

 Now, we need to perform the addition:

 5 + 24 = 29

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression with the new mathematical operations and updated order of operations, we need to follow the PEFMDASC order. In this case, we have prime factor counting (#) before addition (A).

Therefore, the solution would be as follows:

1. Find the prime factor counts of each number:
   a = 8, prime factors: 2, 2, 2, 2
   b = 2, prime factors: 2
   c = 6, prime factors: 2, 3, 3

2. Since prime factor counting comes before addition, compute the prime factor counts of both numbers:
   a # b = 1 (since there is only 1 shared prime factor, which is 2)

3. Now perform the addition:
   a = 8
   b = 2

4. Since the updated order of operations places addition (A) before concatenation (C), evaluate the addition first:

   The answer is: 10.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: According to the revised order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to perform prime factor counting (F), followed by addition and subtraction (AS).

For the given expression 4 # 3 + 2, we first calculate the prime factorization of the absolute values of the numbers involved: 4 = 2Â², 3 = 3, and 2 = 2. Since there are shared prime factors 2, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 2.

Next, we move on to addition and subtraction (AS). The addition part is 3 + 2 = 5.

Since concatenation (C) is the last operation in the revised order, we can now perform the concatenation of the digits of the numbers obtained during prime factor counting and addition, which is just the number 2, making the final answer:

Next, we perform prime factor counting (there are no shared prime factors between 30 and -2):

0.

(However, note that there seems to be a discrepancy in the input, as it shows 3 instead of 14 inside the parentheses. The solution would be different if that was the case.)"
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression 5 + 3#2 using the revised order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to identify which operations need to be performed before others.

Given expression: 5 + 3#2

According to the order of operations, prime factor counting (#) needs to be performed before addition (+).

So, we will first perform prime factor counting for 3 and 2:

3: The prime factors of 3 are 3.
2: The prime factors of 2 are 2.

Since there is only one shared prime factor (3) between 3 and 2, we will write the count of that prime factor, i.e., 1.

Now that we have the prime factor count for both 3 and 2, we can finally perform the addition operation:

2. Exponents: We don't have any exponents in this problem, so we'll move on to the next operation.

3. Prime Factor Counting: We have two numbers to check for prime factor counting: a = 18 and b = 3.
   = 1 (since the unique common prime factors between 18 and 3 are not present).

5. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right): We have subtraction and then addition operations. Let's evaluate the subtraction first:
   a - 2 = 16 (since 18 - 2 = 16).

6. Concatenation: Now we have numbers for concatenation: a = 16 and b = 3.
   a @ b = 163 (concatenating 16 and 3).

Putting these results together, using the new PEFMDASC order of operations, our answer would be:

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: Step 1: Prime factor counting (F)
To find the unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of |8| and |2|, and |6| and |6|:

For |8| (the absolute value of 8), prime factors are 2, 2, 2, and 2 (since 8 = 2Â³ * 2) -> # of unique prime factors is 1 (since 2 is the only prime factor).

For |2|, prime factors are 2 (since 2 = 2).

For |6|, prime factors are 2 and 3 (since 6 = 2 * 3Â²).

Since the prime factor 2 is shared between |8| and |6|, the value of 8 # 6 is 1.

Step 2: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
Now we have the values of 8#2 and 6#6; we can evaluate the multiplication:

1 * 36 (since 6#6 = 36)

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Now we have the values of 1 and 36, we can evaluate the addition:
