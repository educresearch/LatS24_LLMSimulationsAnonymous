llama-2-70b-chat,1,700,systemPrompt1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: The given expression is 8 # 2 + 6 # 6.

First, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting operations.

8 # 2 = 4 (since the prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 1, and the prime factors of 2 are 2 and 1, hence there are 2 shared prime factors)

6 # 6 = 1 (since the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and there is only one shared prime factor between 6 and 6, which is 2)

Now, we need to add the results of the prime factor counting operations.

4 + 1 = 5
