      <td>GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem using the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation. So, we calculate the unique prime factors shared by 3 and 2, but since there's only 1 prime factor (1 and 2 are both prime) and it appears only in the multiplicative factor 2, the count is 1.<br><br>Now, we move to the addition operation.

However, in this case, the prime factor counting operation only includes the digits 2, 3, and itself.  So the prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3.
