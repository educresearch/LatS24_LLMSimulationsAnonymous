mistral-7b-instruct,1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: We have been given an expression with the new mathematical operations and updated order of operations. Let's break it down and apply the operations step by step according to PEFMDASC:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
   Since the given expression is 4 # 3 + 2, we first need to find the unique prime factors shared by |4| and |3|.
   Prime factors of 4 are 2 x 2 and prime factors of 3 are 3. Since there is no shared prime factor (2 is not a prime factor of 3, and 3 is not a prime factor of 4), we have the result 0.

2. Addition and Subtraction (A, S):
   Now, we can move on to the addition part of the expression, i.e., 0 + 2, which equals 2.

So, the steps executed are: Prime Factor Counting -> Addition.
The answer is __.
Answer: 2.","GPT Response: According to the revised order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to perform prime factor counting (F) before addition (A). In this case, since 4 and 3 have no shared prime factors (prime factors for 4 are 2 and 2, and for 3 are 3), the prime factor counting result is 0. Therefore, the expression 4 # 3 is equal to 0. Now, since addition comes before concatenation (A and C), we evaluate the addition 0 + 2, which equals 2. The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Based on the updated order of operations, we first perform prime factor counting, then addition or subtraction (A/S), and lastly concatenation (C).

Given expression: 4 # 3 + 2

Let's evaluate this step by step:

1. Prime factor counting: We find the unique prime factors common to 4 and 3. Since 4's prime factorization is 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 and 3's prime factorization is 3, we have no shared prime factors (i.e., 0). According to the update, this results in 0 when performing prime factor counting (#) operation.

So, now our expression is: 0 + 2

2. Addition (A): Due to the updated order of operations, we perform addition before concatenation, so our expression now becomes: 0 + 2 = 2

Answer: The answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the PEFMDASC order, here are the steps:

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting
First, we need to calculate the prime factor count for the given expression:

4 # 3 + 2 = 0 + (3 # 2) + 2 (Since we need to perform prime factor counting before addition)

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting for 3 # 2
Now, we calculate the prime factor count for 3 # 2:

3 # 2 = 1 (Since prime factors of 3 are 3 and prime factors of 2 are 2, but there is only one shared prime factor 2)

Step 3: Addition
Now, we perform the addition as per the order:

0 + (3 # 2) + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3

So, the answer is 3."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression with the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to identify the operations that need to be performed. In this expression, we have addition (+) and concatenation (@). According to the new order of operations, we need to perform concatenation before addition.

So, the sequence of operations to solve the expression 5 + 2 @ 4 would be as follows:

1. Concatenation: Since we need to concatenate the digits of the numbers 2 and 4 first, the expression becomes 5 + 2 @ 4 = 5 + 26.
2. Addition: After performing concatenation, we need to add the numbers 5 and 26.

Hence, the solution to the given expression is:

The answer is 31.","GPT Response: To solve the given Mathematics problem with the newly introduced operations and updated order of operations, we need to follow the given sequence:

P: There are no parentheses in this expression, so we can move on to the next step.
E: There are no exponents in this expression, so we can move on to the next step.
F: There are no absolute values or prime factors involved in this expression, so we can move on to the next step.
M/D: Addition and subtraction are the only remaining operations in this expression. However, concatenation comes before addition and subtraction according to the updated order of operations, so we need to evaluate the concatenation first.
C: The expression consists of a single instance of concatenation, i.e., 2 @ 4. Therefore, we evaluate the concatenation as follows:

a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256 (This is not the case here, as a and b are just digits, 2 and 4)

However, since a and b are single digits, the result of concatenation would be the same as the sum of those digits. Thus, 2 @ 4 = 2 + 4 = 6.

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 6.","GPT Response: To solve the problem with the new mathematical operations and updated order of operations, we need to follow the PEFMDASC rule carefully:

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in this expression, so we move on to the next operation.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this expression, so we move on to the next operation.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): There are no prime numbers or negative numbers in this expression, so the outcome of this operation is 0.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There is only addition and concatenation in this expression. No multiplication or division.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We have only addition and concatenation in the expression. Let's start with addition:

5 + 2 = 7

Now, we have the result of Addition, which is 7. However, we still have a Concatenation operation left (a@b). Since 'a' is a number (7) and 'b' is also a number (4), we perform the concatenation by merging the digits of these numbers:

7 @ 4 = 74

So, our solution was to first perform the addition and get the sum (7), and then perform the concatenation to get the final answer.

Therefore, the answer is 74.","GPT Response: To find the answer using the PEFMDASC order, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Parentheses
There are no parentheses in the given expression. So we move on to the next operation.

Step 2: Exponents
None present, moving on to the next operation.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
We do not have any numbers given to find the prime factors for and calculate the count, so we proceed to the next step.

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M)
There is no multiplication or division sign present in the expression. So let's move on to the next step.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A)
We have only addition and concatenation in the expression. Since addition comes before concatenation, we'll evaluate the addition first and then perform the concatenation.

Step 6: Addition (A)
5 + 2 = 7

Step 7: Concatenation (C)
Now it's time to concatenate the numbers. Since 7 is a single digit, it stays the same when concatenated. However, we still need to adhere to the order of operations. Concatenation comes last, so the final answer is:

Step 8: Concatenation (C)
The answer is 7 (as is). But since concatenation comes last in our updated order of operations, we need to apply the concatenation operation now:

Step 9: Concatenation (C)
7 @ 4 = 74

The answer is 74."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: According to the expanded order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to evaluate prime factor counting before addition. In this case, since the number of unique prime factors in 3 and 2 are 1 (2) and 0 respectively, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 1.

Therefore, the solution to the problem would be:

The answer is 5 + 1 = 6.","GPT Response: To solve the given Mathematics problem with the newly introduced operations and updated order of operations, we need to follow the PEFMDASC rule:

1. Parentheses: None in this problem, so we move on to the next operation.
2. Exponents: Not applicable here, so we move on to the next operation.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We need to find the shared prime factors of the absolute values of 5 and 3, which are both 5. So, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 1.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): Not applicable here, as there is no multiplication or division sign in this problem, so we move on to the next operation.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We are asked to perform addition, so we'll evaluate it.
6. Concatenation (C): Not applicable here, as there is no ""@"" symbol in the problem, so we can directly move on to the final answer.

So, according to the PEFMDASC order of operations, we need to perform the addition before prime factor counting. Therefore, the solution to the given problem is:

5 + 3 = 8

Then, since prime factor counting (F) is before addition (A/S), we need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation after addition. However, since the result of the prime factor counting operation is only 1 for the given numbers, it doesn't affect the final answer at all. Therefore, the final answer, according to the new operations and updated order of operations, is:

The answer is 8.","GPT Response: To solve the given problem with the newly introduced mathematical operations and updated order of operations, we need to follow the orders as mentioned i.e., PEFMDASC.

Given expression: 5 + 3 # 2

First, we need to take care of the prime factor counting operation i.e., #. So, we evaluate it before addition.

Since prime factors of 3 are 3 and 3 (as 3 is a prime number), and prime factors of 2 are 2, the prime factor count of 3 and 2 is 2.

Now, it has come down to a simple addition problem: 5 + 2

So, the calculation is as follows:

5 + 3 # 2

= 5 + (prime factor count of 3 and 2)

= 5 + 2

= 7

Hence, the solution to the given problem is:

The answer is 7.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 3 # 2 using the revised order of operations PEFMDASC, we follow these steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Calculate the prime factor count of 3 and 2. Since 3 has only one unique prime factor 3 and 2 has only one prime factor 2, the result of this step is 1.

2. Concatenation (C): Since this operation comes after prime factor counting in the order of operations, we next concatenate the results of the prime factor counting step. However, since the result of step 1 is a number (1), and concatenation is a mathematical operation that combines digits, we cannot perform concatenation directly on it. Instead, we include a placeholder '0' to the left of the number obtained in step 1, and perform concatenation on the digits of the resulting number.

Since there is only one digit in the number obtained in step 1, there is no need to add a zero beforehand. So, we have:
-- Current result: 1

3. Addition/Subtraction (A/S): Now, we perform the addition part of this step. Since '+' is included in the Addition/Subtraction category in the order of operations, we add the numbers 5 and the result of the previous step (1).

The current result: 1
Add 5: 1 + 5 = 6

Now, we perform multiplication and division (M/D) from left to right:
18 @ 12 = 216 (since 18 has two digits, we perform concatenation between the two numbers with the same number of digits before moving to the next step)

We then perform prime factor counting (F):
216 # 3 = 0, since the prime factors of 216 and 3 have no common prime factors.

2. Exponents:
   There are no exponents, so move on.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F):
   For this step, calculate the prime factor counting (#) for the pair (18, 3) and (-2, 3) separately.
   a. For 18 and 3, the unique prime factors of absolute values 18 and 3 are 2 and 3. So, 18 # 3 = 2.
   b. For -2 and 3, since they are not negative numbers, this operation is not applicable. The prime factor counting for 2 # 3 is undefined.

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D):
   Multiply the results of the previous prime factor counting steps (if relevant): Since the prime factor counting for the pair (18, 3) is 2, and there is no calculation for the pair (2, 3), the result of this step is the result for the first pair.

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S):
   Perform the addition and subtraction operations in order from left to right. If there are parentheses, solve those first.
   Since the first operation is a concatenation (C), we cannot proceed until the concatenation is solved. Therefore, move on to the next operation, which is also a concatenation.

6. Concatenation (C):
   Now we have two concatenation operations in a row, 6 @ 18 and 18 @ 3.

1. Prime Factor Counting:
First, we perform prime factor counting for 8 and 2: 8 has prime factors 2³, 2cdots, 2 (three 2's), and 2; while 2 has prime factor 2. Since they both have the common prime factor 2, the prime factor counting operation (#) evaluates to 1.

2. Addition:
Next, we perform the addition operation (+) for the results of the prime factor counting of 6 and 6: 1 + 1 = 2.

3. Concatenation:
Finally, we concatenate the results of 8 and 2 (1 and 2, since we performed prime factor counting earlier), and then concatenate the results of thoseconcatenation and 6 (12 and 6).

While concatenating 1 and 12, we obtain 12.
Concatenating 12 and 6, we get the final answer: 126.

So, the answer is 126.","GPT Response: To solve the given expression under the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first focus on the prime factor counting (F) operation:

   a. For 8, we have 2³ (three 2s as prime factors, but since a count is desired, only one 2 is considered as a prime factor)
   b. For 2, we have 2

2. Count the shared prime factors and determine the result: # of unique shared prime factors = 1

Now, since addition (A) is before the concatenation (C), we evaluate the additions within the expression:

1. Evaluate 6 # 6: Prime factorization reveals two shared prime factors: 2. Since count is desired, only one 2 is considered, so the result is 1.
2. Evaluate 8 # 2: We already calculated it above as 1.
