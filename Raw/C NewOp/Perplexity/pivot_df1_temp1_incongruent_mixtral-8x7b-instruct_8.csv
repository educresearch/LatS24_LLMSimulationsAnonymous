mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the new order of operations PEFMDASC, first, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation:

8 # 2 = 2 (since the only shared prime factor is 2)
2 # 6 = 1 (since there is no shared prime factor)

Now, the expression becomes:

2 + 6 # 6

Next, perform the remaining prime factor counting (F):

6 # 6 = 2 (since the only shared prime factor is 2)

Now, the expression becomes:

2 + 2

Lastly, do addition (A):

2 + 2 = 4

So,

The answer is 4."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: Following the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F), then the addition (A).

4 # 3 = 0, because 4 and 3 have no shared prime factors.

0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2.

(Note: The operations of multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction are still performed from left to right in this new order of operations.)"
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Let's go through the problem step by step using the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Parentheses: Calculate 14 + 4, which equals 18.

5 + 24 = 29

The answer is 29."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the expression `8 # 2 + 6 # 6` according to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to perform prime factor counting (F) as it is next to the parentheses (P) in the order.

So,

8 # 2 = 0 (since 8 and 2 do not share any prime factors)

and

6 # 6 = 2 (since 6 has prime factors 2 and 3, and 6 has prime factors 2 and 3, they share 2 prime factors in total)

After evaluating the prime factor counting, the expression becomes:

0 + 2 (since the other operation is addition)

Finally, we add these two numbers:

The answer is 2."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow these steps:

1. Perform the Prime Factor Counting operation (F) inside the parentheses:
4 # 3 = 1 (since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3, so they share no prime factors)

2. Perform the addition operation (A):
1 + 2 = 3

Therefore, the answer is 3."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Let's break down the expression using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. Parentheses: Calculate the expression within the parentheses first (14 + 4)
2. Prime Factor Counting (F): Perform the # operation before addition and subtraction
3. Concatenation (C): Perform the @ operation last, after all other operations.

So,

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 (since there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3)
= 6 @ 18 + 12
= 618 + 12
= 630

The answer is 630."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation:

5 + 3 # 2
5 + 1 (since the prime factors of 2 are 2 and 1, and 3 has no prime factors, the result of 3 # 2 is 1)

Now, we are left with:

5 + 1

Finally, we perform addition (A):

The answer is 6."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: First, we need to evaluate the concatenation operation, as it comes before addition in the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC).

2 @ 4 = 24

Now, replace 2 @ 4 with the result 24 in the original expression:

5 + 24

Next, perform the addition operation:

5 + 24 = 29

The answer is 29."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: For the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6:

First, we need to perform Prime Factor Counting (F) for the first and second terms:

8 # 2 = 2 (since the prime factors of 8 and 2 are 2, and there is only 1 shared prime factor)

6 # 6 = 1 (since the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and there is no shared prime factor between 6 and 6)

After that, we do addition (A) since it is before concatenation (C) in the order of operations:

2 + 1 = 3

Lastly, there is no need to perform concatenation (C) as it remains the only operation left, but it applies to numbers, not results of previous operations.

So, the answer is 3."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 4#3 + 2, we need to follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC. In this case, P (parentheses) is not needed, so we proceed to F (Prime Factor Counting). The prime factors of 4 are 2 and of 3 are 3, and they don't have any common prime factor, so 4#3 = 0.

Now we are left with 0 + 2, which is an addition operation. Following the order A/S (Addition and Subtraction), we perform the addition.

The answer is 2."

6 @ (18) + 12 - 2#3

Next, we perform prime factor counting (F):

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

We can drop the prime factor counting operation since there are no shared prime factors between 6 and 18. Now, we perform multiplication and division (from left to right) (M/D):

108 + 12 - 0

Then, we perform addition and subtraction (from left to right) (A/S):

120 - 0

The answer is 120."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: First, we need to follow the order of operations and evaluate the prime factor counting (F) before addition (A).

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: Let's solve the problem using the revised order of operations PEFMDASC, focusing on illustrating each step clearly with the new operations and their placement in the order of operations.

1. Prime Factor counting (F)
   For the first part, 8 # 2, calculate the unique prime factors of 8 and 2. The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, while the prime factor of 2 is 2 itself, so they share one prime factor, 2. Thus, 8 # 2 = 1.
   For the second part, 6 # 6, find the unique prime factors of 6 and 6. They are 2 and 3 for both, so we count two unique prime factors; that is, 6 # 6 = 2.

2. Addition (A)
   Sum up the results from the first part: 1 + 2 = 3

Therefore, the answer is 3."

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations, making sure to highlight the new operations and their placement.

1. First, perform the operation inside the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18. So the expression becomes 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3.
2. Next, we handle the new operation Concatenation (C). However, there are no matching integers for Concatenation, so we skip this step and proceed.
3. Now, we perform the Prime Factor Counting (F): 2 # 3 = 1, since the only shared prime factor between 2 and 3 is 1 (which is not considered a prime number). So the expression turns into 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1.
4. Next, handle the operation of Addition (A): 6 @ 18 + 11. Again, there are no matching integers for Concatenation, so we skip this step and proceed.
5. Perform the Concatenation (C): 1836 + 11. Results in 183611.
6. The final operation is Subtraction (S): 183611 - 1. The answer is 183610.

The answer is 183610."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Let's solve the problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations.

1. First, we need to perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation:
   Calculate the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 5 and 2.

   The prime factors of 5 are 5, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since there are no shared prime factors between the two numbers, the result of this operation is 0.

2. Next, we need to perform Addition (A):
   Add the result of the Prime Factor Counting to the number 3.

   So, 0 (result of F) + 3 = 3.

Therefore, the answer is 3."
