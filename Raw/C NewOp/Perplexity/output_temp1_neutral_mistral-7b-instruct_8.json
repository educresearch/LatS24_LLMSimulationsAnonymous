The '+' symbol represents addition.\n2. The '#' symbol represents Prime Factor Counting (F).\n3. The '+' sign and the '3' and '2' are operands for the Prime Factor Counting operation (they are the two numbers being compared for shared prime factors).\n4. The '5' is an operand for the addition operation.\n\nUnder the PEFMDASC order, we first perform Prime Factor Counting (F) on the operands 3 and 2:\n\nStep 1: Prime Factor Counting (F):\nSince both 3 and 2 are positive integers, their prime factors are all positive as well. From the key examples given, we see that prime factors for 2 are 2, and the prime factors for 3 are 3. As we discussed before, since there is no shared prime factor between these two numbers, their prime factor count is 0 (as in example (c)).\n\nStep 2: Addition (A/S): Now that we have the Prime Factor Counting performed, we can move on to the addition operation: Add 5 to the result of the prime factor counting step.\n\nStep 3: The answer is: 5 + 0 = 5.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the expression 5 + 3 # 2, using the PEFMDASC order, is 5."}]}]
