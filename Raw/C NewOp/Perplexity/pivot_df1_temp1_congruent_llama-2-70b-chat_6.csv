llama-2-70b-chat,1,700,systemPrompt4,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: Sure, let's work through this problem step by step, using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
	* 8 # 2 = 8# 2 = 2 (since the prime factors of 8 are 1, 2, 2, and the prime factors of 2 are 1, 2)
	* 6 # 6 = 6 # 6 = 1 (since the prime factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and the prime factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3)

1. Concatenation (C): 6 @ (14 + 4) = 6 @ 18 = 6 @ 18 = 186
2. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): 186 + 12 = 198

The answer is 196.

Here's the breakdown of each step:

1. Concatenation (C): In this step, we concatenate the digits of 6 and 18. Since 6 is a single digit, we simply append it to the front of 18 to get 186.
2. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Next, we add 12 to 186. Since 186 is a positive number, we simply add 12 to get 198.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): In this step, we count the number of shared prime factors between 198 and 3. Since 3 is a prime number and 198 has a prime factor of 3, we increase the count by 1 to get 1.
4. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Finally, we subtract 2 from 198. Since 198 is a positive number, we simply subtract 2 to get 196.

Therefore, the final answer is 196."
