      <td>GPT Response: To solve the given Mathematics problem with the newly introduced operations and updated order of operations, we need to follow the PEFMDASC rule:<br><br>1. Parentheses: We don't have any in this problem, so we'll move on to the next operation.<br>2. Exponents: We don't have any exponents in this problem, so we'll move on to the next operation.<br>3. Prime Factor Counting (F): However, prime factor counting is not involved in this problem as there are no numbers given with negative signs or complicated absolute values. So, let's move on to the next operation.<br>4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): We don't have any multiplication or division sign in this problem, but we'll remember this step since it comes before addition and subtraction in the order of operations.<br>5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We have an operation @ which is defined as concatenation. In the given expression, 5 + 2@4, we have an addition operation and a concatenation operation. However, following the PEFMDASC order, we should perform the operation inside the parentheses (if any), exponents, primer factor counting, multiplication and division (from left to right), addition and subtraction (from left to right), and finally concatenation. But in our case, there are no parentheses, exponents, prime factor counting, or multiplication and division. So, the correct order of performing the operations here is addition and subtraction (from left to right), which means we should perform the addition operation before the concatenation operation.<br>6. Concatenation (C): Since we need to perform the addition operation before concatenation, we first add the numbers 5 and 2, which gives us 7. Now, we can perform the concatenation operation between the result (7) and the number 4. So, the final answer is 7@4.<br><br>The answer is 74.</td>

Prime Factor Counting (F): This operation is not involved in the problem, so we move on to the next step.<br>4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): We see that the @ symbol represents concatenation, but the problem presents multiplication and division symbols instead. We make the substitution as follows: 2@4 is equivalent to 2 · 4 = 8. Therefore, the problem reduces to 5 + 8.<br>5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We perform this operation from left to right:<br>   First, we add 5 and 8, which results in 13.<br>6.
