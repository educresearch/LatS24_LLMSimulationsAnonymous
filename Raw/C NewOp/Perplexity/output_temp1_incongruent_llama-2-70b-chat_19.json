We need to find the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 8 and 2. The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 1, and the prime factors of 2 are 2 and 1.

The prime factors of 6 are 2, 3, and 1, and the prime factors of 6 are the same, 2, 3, and 1. Therefore, the result of 6 # 6 is 2.\n3. The third operation is 2 + 2, which is an addition operation.
