mistral-7b-instruct,1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: The given expression is ""4#3 + 2."" According to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F). In this case, the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, their prime factor counting is 0 (as we've observed in examples (c) and (d)).

The next step is to perform the addition (S). Since the prime factor counting (F) was 0, we can directly add the numbers 4 and 2.

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 6.","GPT Response: According to the revised order of operations (PEFMDASC), prime factor counting (F) should be performed before addition (A). Therefore, let's first find the prime factor count for numbers 4 and 3.

For number 4, prime factors are 2 and 2. For number 3, prime factors are 3. Since there is no shared prime factor, the operation 4 # 3 results in 0.

Hence, the answer is:

The answer is 0.","GPT Response: In the given mathematical expression, we have prime factor counting (#) and addition (A) operations. According to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to evaluate prime factor counting before addition.

Given expression: 4 # 3 + 2

First, we will calculate the prime factor counting operation:

 Since 4 = 2^2 and 3 = 3^1, the unique prime factors common to both 4 and 3 are empty, so the result of the prime factor counting operation is 0.

Now, since we need to evaluate addition before concatenation, we will proceed with addition:

The addition operation is between 0 (the result of the prime factor counting operation) and 3

So, the sum of 0 and 3 is 3.

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the PEFMDASC order, follow these steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Find the prime factor count for 4 and 3. Since there is no shared prime factor between them, the prime factor count is 0.
   Therefore, 4 # 3 = 0.

2. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Perform the addition operation after the prime factor counting, which is 2 in this case.

   The answer is 2."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: Based on the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to first evaluate the concatenation operation between 2 and 4 before adding it to 5. So the solution would be:

The answer is 5 + 26 = 21.","GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to evaluate the concatenation operation between 2 and 4. so, the given expression becomes:

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 21.","GPT Response: To solve the given problem with the new mathematical operations and order of operations, we need to follow the PEFMDASC rule:

1. Parentheses: None in this problem
2. Exponents: None in this problem
3. Prime factor counting (F): None in this problem as neither a nor b are negative numbers and require finding prime factors.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There is concatenation (@) instead of multiplication or division, so the M/D step does not apply here.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): 5 + 2@4
6. Concatenation (C): Since there is an addition sign (+) before the concatenation, we need to evaluate the addition first and then the concatenation.

Solution:
Evaluate 2@4 first, as it is inside the concatenation: 2@4 = 24.
Now, evaluate the addition: 5 + 24 = 29.

So, the problem 5 + 2@4 is a concatenation of the results of the addition 5 + 2 (=29) and the concatenation 2@4 (=24): Result = 2924.

Final answer: The answer is 2924.","GPT Response: Step 1: Identify and handle any parentheses, if present. In this case, there are no parentheses, so we move on to the next operation.

Step 2: Perform any exponentiation. In this problem, there is no exponentiation, so we move on to the next operation.

Step 3: Carry out prime factor counting (#). In the given problem, there is no prime factor counting, so we will proceed to the next operation.

Step 4: Perform multiplication and division (M/D) from left to right. In the given problem, there is only multiplication and no division, so we will carry out the multiplication operation.

First, we need to take care of the @ symbol, which represents the concatenation operation. Since it is left-associative and has a lower precedence than multiplication (according to the PEFMDASC order), we have to first perform the concatenation operation between 2 and 4 to get 24, and then perform the multiplication between 5 and 24.

So, the given expression becomes: 5 + 2 @ 4 = 5 + 24.

Addition comes next in our order of operations, but since there are only addition and concatenation, and we've already accounted for the concatenation operation, we can directly perform the addition.

The answer is 29."

2. Exponents: None in this expression.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): Before performing addition.
   The prime factors of 5 are 5,
   The prime factors of 3 are 2, 3.

Since the prime factor counting operations are evaluated before addition, we will perform the prime factor counting for each part of the expression separately:

1) 8 # 2: The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 2 are no prime factors since 2 is a prime number itself. Since there are no common prime factors between 8 and 2, their prime factor counting is 0.

2) 6 # 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and since 6 is a perfect square of 2, it also has 2 as a prime factor. So, there is 1 unique prime factor, 2, that is common to both 6 and itself.

First, we have prime factor counting (F) which is applied to the given numbers before any other operations. So we evaluate:

8 # 2:
Since the only unique prime factors for 8 are 2 and 2, there's 2 shared prime factors, so the result of this operation is 2.

Next, we have multiplication and division (M/D), and we have multiple operations at this level in the equation. In this case, since we have multiple # operations, we should perform those first to find the results of each pair before applying addition or subtraction later.

Therefore, we perform 6 # 6:
Since the only unique prime factors for 6 are 2 and 3, each number has different prime factors, which means there's no shared prime factor. So the result of this operation is 0.

Now we have results for each pair of # operations, so we perform the addition:

   a. 8 = 2³ × 2
   b. 2 = 2
   c. 6 = 2² × 3

2. Multiplication and Division (M/D):
   Since there are no division operations in the given expression, we can skip this part.

3. Concatenation (C):
   Concatenating 2 with each number:
   a. 8 # 2 = 0 (no common prime factors, so the result is 0)
   b. 2 # 6 = 26 (the prime factors for both 2 and 6 are different, so concatenate them)
   c. 6 # 6 = 66 (prime factors for both numbers are the same, so concatenate them)

4. Addition and Subtraction (A/S):
   Adding the results from step 3:
   a. 0 + 26 = 26
   b. 26 + 66 = 92

5. Exponents (E):
   No exponents are present in the problem, so this step can be skipped.

7. Addition and Subtraction (A/S):
   Combine the results from Step 4:
   0 + (26 + 66) = 92

8. Concatenation (C):
