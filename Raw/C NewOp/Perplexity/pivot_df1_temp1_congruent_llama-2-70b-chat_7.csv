llama-2-70b-chat,1,700,systemPrompt3,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: The answer is 0 + 6 = 6.

Explanation:
In the updated order of operations, prime factor counting (F) comes before addition and subtraction (A/S). Therefore, we need to evaluate 8#2 and 6#6 separately before adding them.

8#2 = 8 # 2 = 0 (since there are no shared prime factors between 8 and 2)
6#6 = 6 # 6 = 6 (since there is only one shared prime factor, 3)

Now, we add 0 and 6, which gives us 6.
