mistral-7b-instruct,1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression 4 # 3 + 2 according to the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to perform prime factor counting:

1. Prime factor counting:
Since both 4 and 3 are positive numbers, their unique prime factors are shared as follows:
- Prime factors of 4: 2, 2
- Prime factors of 3: 3

The number of unique prime factors shared is the result of the prime factor counting operation: 1.

2. The final computation:
Since prime factor counting is the third operation in the expanded order of operations, now we can proceed with the given addition. Since there is only one digit in the result of prime factor counting, we can directly add that digit 1 to the second number 2:
- Addition: 1 + 2 = 3

Therefore, the final answer according to the updated order of operations is:

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to perform prime factor counting (F) and then addition (A).

Given the expression 4 # 3 + 2, we have:

1. Prime factor counting (F):
For 4, the prime factors are 2 and 2. For 3, the prime factor is 3. Since these prime factors don't have any commonality, the result is 0 (no shared prime factors).

2. Addition (A):
Now, we perform the addition of the results obtained from the two previous steps, i.e., 0 and 2. Therefore, the final answer is 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the newly introduced mathematical operations and the given order of operations, we need to follow the sequence: P, F, M/D, A/S, C.

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting
First, we determine the prime factors common to both numbers, which in this case are 4 and 3. The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since they share no common prime factor, the prime factor counting operation (#) results in 0.

Step 2: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Since there is subtraction in the problem, we should perform this operation before any other arithmetic or concatenation. We have 4, and we want to subtract 3 from it.

The number line subtraction shows: 4 - 3 = 1

Step 3: Concatenation (C)
Since concatenation is the last operation to be performed, we concatenate the result of the previous step (1) with the number 3.

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the given order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): 
   First, we find the prime factor count for 4 and 3, which are 2 and 3, respectively (since prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and prime factors of 3 are 3). Therefore, 4 # 3 = 1.

2. Addition and Subtraction (AS):
   Since we performed prime factor counting (F) before addition (AS), we can now perform the addition.

3. Concatenation (C):
   Now, we perform the concatenation since it comes after addition (A) in the order of operations.

   Therefore, 4 # 3 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3

   However, according to the order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to concatenate 3 with the result from the previous step.

   So, 3 (from step 3.A) @ 1 (from step 1.F) = 31

The answer is 31."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression using the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to identify which operations need to be performed first.

Given expression: 5 + 2 @ 4

Based on the new order of operations, concatenation (C) comes last. So, we need to perform addition (A) and multiplication or division (M/D) before concatenation (C). In the given expression, we only have addition.

Therefore, according to the new order of operations, we need to evaluate the addition (5 + 2) before performing concatenation (2 @ 4).

5 + 2 = 7

Now that we have the result of the addition, let's perform the concatenation to get the final answer:

7 @ 4 = 74

So, the final answer according to the new order of operations is:

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: To solve the given problem using the newly introduced mathematical operations and Updated Order of Operations (PEFMDASC):

1. We first evaluate what is inside the parentheses, which is the concatenation operation: 2 @ 4 = 24
2. Then we add the numbers outside the parentheses: 5 + 24 = 29

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: To solve the problem 5 + 2 @ 4, we need to follow the updated order of operations, PEFMDASC:

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in the expression, so we move on to the next step.

2. Exponents: None present.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F): since prime factors of 5 is 5 and prime factors of 2 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 2, there is one common prime factor 2. So, 5 # 2 # 4 = 5 # (2#4) = 5 # 2 = 0 (as per the key examples).

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): Since we encountered prime factor counting (F) instead of multiplication or division, we jump ahead to the next step.

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): This is the first arithmetic operation in our expression, so we evaluate it. Here, we perform addition before concatenation since 'A' comes before 'C' in the order of operations.

So, the solution would be: 5 + 2 = 7 and since we encountered prime factor counting (F) before concatenation, the answer would be 0 (as per the key examples).

So, the incorrect problem statement 5 + 2 @ 4 has an answer of 0. To avoid confusion, it's always crucial to ensure the order of operations is correct before performing calculations.","GPT Response: Step 1: Identify and apply the Parentheses (P): There are no parentheses in this expression, so we move on to the next operation.

Step 2: Identify and apply Exponents (E): There is no exponent in this expression, so we move on to the next operation.

Step 3: Identify and apply Prime Factor Counting (F): We do not have two numbers to compare for prime factor counting, so we move on to the next operation.

Step 4: Identify and apply Multiplication and Division (M/D) from left to right: We do not have any multiplication or division signs, so we move on to the next operation.

Step 5: Identify and apply Addition and Subtraction (A/S) from left to right: We have 5 and the addition sign (+), so we apply this operation.

Step 6: Identify and apply Concatenation (C): We have the addition sign (+) between 5 and 2 @ 4. Since addition comes before concatenation in the PEFMDASC order, we first evaluate the addition, and then perform concatenation.

Step 7: Perform the addition: 5 + 2 = 7

Step 8: Apply the concatenation: Since 7 and '@' are not numbers, there is no concatenation to be performed. The expression 5 + 2 @ 4 is undefined since it violates the PEFMDASC order of operations.

Please note that in practical mathematics, having an operation like concatenation in the middle of an expression, such as 5 + 2 @ 4, would be an error and should be corrected. In this example, we provided the step-by-step solution for demonstration purposes and stressing the importance of using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC) when performing new operations like concatenation. The answer is undefined in this case."

The last operation is prime factor counting:

738 # 3

Since 738 has prime factors 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, and 13. Prime factor 2 is shared between 738 and 3 twice. So, the number of unique shared prime factors is 2 * 2 = 4.
