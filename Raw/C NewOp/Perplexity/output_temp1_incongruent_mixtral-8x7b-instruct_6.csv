6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

First, perform the operation inside the parentheses:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, calculate the prime factor counting operation:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Now, perform the concatenation operation:

618 + 12 - 0

Then, do addition and subtraction from left to right:

630 - 0 = 630

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 630."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

1. There are no Parentheses, Exponents, nor Prime Factor Counting (F) in this expression, so we move on to Multiplication and Division (M/D). However, there are no multiplication or division operations in this expression.
2. Next is Addition and Subtraction (A/S). Here, we have the addition operation: 5 + 2@4
3. Before performing the addition, we need to calculate the Concatenation (C). The expression 2@4 means to concatenate the digits of 2 and 4 and results in 24.
4. Now replace 2@4 with the result of the Concatenation: 5 + 24
5. Finally, perform the Addition (A). The answer is 29.

1. First, perform the operation inside the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18
2. Next, use the newly calculated value to perform the Concatenation operation with 6: 6 @ 18 = 618
3. Now, perform the Subtraction operation: 618 + 12 = 630
4. Lastly, perform the Prime Factor Counting operation with 2 and 3 (which is 1 since they share a single prime factor of 2) and subtract that value from the previous result: 630 - 1 = 629

The answer is 629."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.
                    It's crucial to get this right for accurate calculations.

1. There are no parentheses or exponents in the expression, so we move on to Prime Factor counting (F). However, there is no Prime Factor counting involved in this expression.
2. The next operations are Multiplication and Division (M/D), but there are no multiplication or division in the expression.
3. The next operations are Addition and Subtraction (A/S). Addition is present in our expression.

So, the first step is simply 5 + 3, which equals 8.
Now, we have a Prime Factor counting step:

1. The expression now is 8 # 2. The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and there are no prime factors of 2. Hence, there are no shared prime factors to count.

Therefore,

The answer is 0."
