systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

Given expression: 4 # 3 + 2

First, we perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation:

Number of unique prime factors shared by absolute values of 4 and 3 is 0 (since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and 3 is a prime number with no shared prime factors). So, 4 # 3 = 0.

Now, the expression becomes: 0 + 2

According to this order, Prime Factor Counting (F) should be performed before Addition and Subtraction (A/S).

First, let's calculate the Prime Factor Counting for each number:

8 # 2
Prime factors of 8: 2, 2, 2
Prime factors of 2: 2

They share one prime factor 2, so 8 # 2 = 1

Similarly,

6 # 6
Prime factors of 6: 2, 3
Prime factors of 6: 2, 3

They share two prime factors, 2 and 3, so 6 # 6 = 2

Now, based on the order of operations, we perform Addition (A) since there are no other operations with higher precedence:

1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3."

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): There are no exponents or parentheses to evaluate first, so we start with prime factor counting. The prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. They do not have any shared prime factors, so 3 # 2 = 0.
2. Addition (A): Now we move on to addition. We have 5 + 0 from the previous step. So, 5 + 0 = 5.

The answer is 5.

Therefore, the solution to 5 + 3#2 is 5."
