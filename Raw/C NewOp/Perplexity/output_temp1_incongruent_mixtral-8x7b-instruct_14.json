First, identify the operation that needs to be performed according to the order. In this case, there are no parentheses, exponents, prime factor counting, multiplication, or division. The first operation we encounter is addition. However, based on the new order of operations, we need to perform prime factor counting (F) before addition (A). So, we'll perform the prime factor counting operation.\n\n5 # 2\n\nTo calculate this, find the prime factors of both numbers and count the shared prime factors:\n\nPrime factors of 5: 5\nPrime factors of 2: 2\n\nSince there are no shared prime factors, the prime factor counting operation (F) will result in 0.\n\nSo, 5 # 2 = 0\n\n2.
