Let's solve the problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations, with a focus on illustrating the new operations.\n\n1. Prime Factor Counting (F): There are no exponents or parentheses to evaluate first, so we start with prime factor counting. The prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. They do not have any shared prime factors, so 3 # 2 = 0.\n2. Addition (A): Now we move on to addition. We have 5 + 0 from the previous step.
