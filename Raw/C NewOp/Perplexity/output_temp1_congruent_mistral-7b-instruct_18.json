Since the problem does not contain any parentheses or exponents, we start with the prime factor counting (F).\n\n1. Prime Factor Counting (F): We find the prime factors common to |3| and |2|. They are both 2, so we have 2 shared prime factors. Given that, the prime factor counting result is 2.\n\n2.

Addition and Subtraction (A/S): \nWe perform the addition (5 + 3), getting an intermediate result of 8.\n\n4. Concatenation (C): However, since there is no concatenation sign present in the expression (only prime factor counting has been applied so far), we cannot evaluate the concatenation operation yet.\n\nThe final answer: Since we did not get the chance to evaluate the concatenation operation, the result we have obtained (8) cannot serve as the final answer. In fact, performing concatenation with the result we have obtained will lead to an incorrect answer, as the problem does not contain any information about concatenating numbers.
