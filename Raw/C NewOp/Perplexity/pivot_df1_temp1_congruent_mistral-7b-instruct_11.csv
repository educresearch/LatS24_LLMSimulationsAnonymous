mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression using the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to follow the given sequence:

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in the given expression, so we move on to the next operation.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents in the given expression, so we move on to the next operation.
3. Prime Factor Counting: We cannot perform prime factor counting with just digits, as prime factor counting is defined for integers, not individual digits. So, we move on to the next operation.
4. Multiplication and Division: There is no multiplication or division in the given expression, so we move on to the next operation.
5. Addition and Subtraction (Left to Right): The expression contains only addition and concatenation. Since addition comes before concatenation in the new order of operations, we will perform the addition first.

5 + 2 = 7 (Perform Addition)

Now, we will perform the concatenation operation.

7 @ 4 = 74 (Perform Concatenation)

The answer is 74."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve the problem with the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to perform prime factor counting (F) for each number:

1. For 8: Prime factors are 2 and 2, so 8 has a prime factor count of 2.
2. For 2: It already has only 1 prime factor, so its prime factor count is 1.

Since prime factor counting (F) needs to be done before addition (S), we calculate 8 # 2:
0 (since there are no shared prime factors between 8 and 2).

So, the final answer is 0.
The answer is 0."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to evaluate prime factor counting since it comes before addition in the new order. In this case, the prime factor counting operation is between the numbers 4 and 3. However, there are no common prime factors between the numbers 4 and 3, so the prime factor counting operation results in 0.

Now, we can move on to the addition part. Since we need to evaluate addition before concatenation, we add the result of the prime factor counting operation (which is 0) and the number 2.

The final calculation is:

4 # 3 + 2 = 0(from prime factor counting) + 2 = 2

So, the answer is:

The answer is 2."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first take care of the parentheses:

1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18.

Now we apply the new operations and their order:

2. Concatenation: Since there is no other operation apart from the concatenation symbol (@), we can directly evaluate it: 6 @ 18 = 618.

3. Prime Factor Counting (#): However, this operation is not involved in the problem, so its result is 0.

4. Addition: The next operation is addition (+). We have: 618 + 12.

5. Addition: Adding the numbers 618 and 12, we get: 630.

Now, we need to apply the final operation:

6. Subtraction: The last operation in the sequence is subtraction (-), but it's applied to the already calculated result (630) with the number 2: 630 - 2 = 628.

So, the solution to the problem 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3 is: The answer is 628."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to perform prime factor counting (F) before addition (S). In this particular case, we have 3 as one of the numbers involved in the prime factor counting operation. The prime factors of 2 are 2, so the count of unique prime factors shared by 3 and 2 is 0 since there is no shared prime factor between them. Therefore, the solution to this problem is:

5 + 2 = 7

Next, perform the concatenation of the digits of 7 and the second number 4:

7 @ 4 = 74

So, the final answer is:

First, let's do the prime factor counting (#):

8 # 2 = 2 # 8 = 1 (since the only shared prime factors between 8 and 2 are 2.)

And, 6 # 6 = 3 (since both 6 and 6 have 2 as a prime factor twice and 3 as a prime factor).

With the prime factor counting done, we move on to addition (A/S):

1 + 3 = 4.

Hence, the final answer according to the updated order of operations is:

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression 4 # 3 + 2, we need to follow the newly introduced order of operations, PEFMDASC:

1. Parentheses: None present in the expression, so we move on to the next operation.
2. Exponents: None present in the expression, so we move on to the next operation.
3. Prime Factor Counting: Since we have two numbers, 4 and 3, we need to find the number of unique prime factors they share. Here's a quick check: Prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and prime factors of 3 are 3. We have 1 shared prime factor, 2, that appears twice. So, 4 # 3 = 1 * 2 * 1 = 2.
4. Multiplication and Division: Since there's no multiplication or division in the given expression, we move on to the next operation.
5. Addition and Subtraction: We need to evaluate the addition operation now: 2 + 2 = 4.

1. Parentheses: Solve the expression within the parentheses first.
   14 + 4 = 18

2. Prime Factor Counting (#): Perform prime factor counting between the digits of the two operands. In this case, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we can directly move on to Step 3.

3. Multiplication and Division (M/D): Perform multiplication and division from left to right. But in this expression, we don't have any multiplication or division operations, so we can skip this step.

4. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Perform addition and subtraction from left to right.

5. Concatenation (C): Perform concatenation from left to right.

Given expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2  #  3

Sub-expression in parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18

Now applying the order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Parentheses: 18

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 5 + 2 @ 4, we need to follow the updated order of operations: PEFMDASC. 

First, we handle the parentheses: since there are no parentheses in this expression, we move on to the next operation.

Next, we tackle exponents (none in this problem), prime factor counting (none), and multiplication and division. However, there is no multiplication or division here.

Now, we come to addition and subtraction. We have the addition operation 5 + 2, and since we follow the left-to-right rule, we add 2 to 5. This results in 7.

Lastly, we have concatenation: 7 @ 4. We merge the digits of 7 and 4. This operation results in the final answer:

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem following the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to perform prime factor counting:

1. Prime Factor Counting (8 and 2):
   Prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2 (twice), and prime factors of 2 are just 2. So, 8#2 equals the prime factor count of 2, which is 1.

2. Prime Factor Counting (6 and 6):
   Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 (twice), and prime factors of 6 are the same, so 6#6 equals the prime factor count of 2 and 3, which is 2.

In this particular expression, the prime factor counting (F) operation should come before addition (A), so we will perform the prime factor counting first.

Given expression: 4 # 3 + 2

First, calculate the prime factor counting for 3 and 4:
- Prime factors of 3: 3
- Prime factors of 4: 2, 2

Since 3 has only one prime factor (3), and the prime factors of 4 (2, 2) have two occurrences in total, we have one prime factor (2) common between them. The prime factor counting (#) result is 1.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new mathematical operations and updated order of operations, we first need to identify which operations need to be performed.  ap Bast Eldentoe: 

In this problem, we have addition (A) and prime factor counting (F). According to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), prime factor counting (F) needs to be done before addition (A). So the correct sequence of operations is: 

F > A

Now, let's apply the operations:

We have the number 3 and need to perform prime factor counting (#) with 2:

The prime factors of 3 are 3, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since there is only one prime factor that is shared between 3 and 2, the prime factor counting result is 1.
