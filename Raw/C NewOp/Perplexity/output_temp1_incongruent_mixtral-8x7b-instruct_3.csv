In this case, we are given:

5 + 2@4

Since there are no parenthesis or exponents to consider, we move on to prime factor counting. However, we see that we already have a @ operation before arriving at the # operation. So, we first perform the @ operation:

5 + 2@4 = 5 + 24

Now, we need to perform the addition. We don't have any other operations left to evaluate:

5 + 24 = 29

The answer is 29."

                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

Next in the order is M/D, multiplication and division. Again, there are no instances of these operations in the problem.

Next is A/S, addition and subtraction. There is an addition operation in the problem, so we will perform that next.

First, we evaluate the prime factor counting (F) between 3 and 2, which is 0 since they share no common prime factors.

Then, we move to addition (A). So, we add 5 and 0 (the result of F operation), which results in 5.

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:

                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.
                    It's crucial to get this right for accurate calculations.
                    
                    Revised Order of Operations: PEFMDASC
                    P: Parentheses
                    E: Exponents
                    F: Prime Factor counting
                    M/D: Multiplication and Division (left to right)
                    A/S: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
                    C: Concatenation (left to right)
                    
                    Important Examples Demonstrating New Operations and Order:
                    (i) 5 @ 3 + 6
                    = 5 @ 9 (since we need to evaluate addition before concatenation)
                    = 59

                    (ii) 5 # 3 + 6
                    = 0 + 6 (since we need to evaluate prime factorization before addition)
                    = 6

                    (iii) 5 - 3 @ 6
                    = 2 @ 6 (since we need to evaluate subtraction before concatenation)
                    = 26

                    (iv) 5 - 3 # 6
                    = 5 - 1 (since we need to evaluate prime factorization before subtraction)
                    = 4

                    (vi) (3 + 10 # 2) * 5 @ 42 
                    = (3 + 1) * 5 @ 42 (we need to evaluate what is in the parenthesis first and prime factor counting is before addition)
                    = 4 * 5 @ 42  (we need to evaluate multiplication before concatenation
                    = 20 @ 42 = 2042. (concatenation is last)
                    
                    Negative Prompts:
                    * Do Not assume traditional order of operations (PEMDAS); use the updated PEFMDASC instead.
                    * Avoid skipping steps or assuming familiarity with the new operations.
                    * Do Not generalize or use examples not directly related to the given operations and expressions.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: Let's tackle the problem using the PEFMDASC order of operations, taking into account the new mathematical operations Concatenation (C) and Prime Factor Counting (F).

Step 1: Parentheses
14 + 4 = 18

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
2 # 3 = 0 (since prime factors of 2 are 2 and prime factors of 3 are 3; no shared prime factors)

Step 3: Concatenation (C)
6 @ 18 (no operations remain between concatenation and 6 @ 18)

Step 4: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
Now, we'll perform the first subtraction operation.
6 @ 18 + 12 = 618 + 12 (since concatenation has higher priority)

Step 5: Concatenation (C)
Next, we need to perform the concatenation between the result from the previous step and 2.
61812 @ 2

Step 6: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
Observe there are no more subtraction or addition operations.

The answer is 618120.

So, 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 = 618120."
