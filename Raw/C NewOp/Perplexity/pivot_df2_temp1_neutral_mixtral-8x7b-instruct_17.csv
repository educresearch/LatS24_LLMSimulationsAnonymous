So, the answer is 4.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to perform the prime factor counting (F) operation. The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. They do not have any shared prime factors, so 4 # 3 equals 0.

   Prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
   Prime factors of 3 are 3 (since 3 is a prime number itself).
   Therefore, 4 # 3 = 0 because there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3.
2. Addition (A): Perform the addition operation now that the prime factor counting is done.

Therefore, the answer is 29.","GPT Response: According to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to perform concatenation before addition. So,

Therefore, the answer is 29.","GPT Response: First, we need to evaluate the concatenation operation since it comes before addition in the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC). The number 2 and ","GPT Response: Let's solve the expression 5 + 2 @ 4 using the revised order of operations PEFMDASC.

1. Identify the new operations: In this expression, we have Concatenation (C), represented as @.
2. Determine the order: According to the revised order of operations, Concatenation (C) should be performed after Addition/Subtraction (A/S), which is step 7. However, in this case, there are no Addition or Subtraction operations, so Concatenation will not be performed. It remains 5 + 2 @ 4.
3. Perform the other operations in order: Since there are no other operations besides Addition and Concatenation, we don't need to proceed with steps 3-6.

The answer is 7.

Notes:

* We didn't need to perform concatenation since it's only applicable when both numbers are non-negative integers and it should be performed after all other arithmetic operations, but we don't have any such scenario here.
* There were no multiplication, division, exponents, or parenthesis, so they didn't play any role in solving this expression."

Updated Order of Operations with New Operations

The field of mathematics has evolved with the introduction of two new operations, concatenation (C) and prime factor counting (F), and as a result, the order of operations has been updated to PEFMDASC. This article presents examples that illustrate the application of these new operations and their placement in the revised order of operations.

Concatenation (C)
Concatenation is denoted by @ and represents the operation of joining the digits of two numbers together. When using concatenation, one does not consider the signs of the numbers involved, and instead focuses on the absolute values. Here are some examples:

* If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
* If a = 12 and b = -56, then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
* If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

Prime Factor Counting (F)
Prime Factor Counting is denoted by # and calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of two numbers. Here are some examples:

* If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1, since the prime factors of 12 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 56 are 2 and 7, resulting in one shared prime factor, 2.
* If a = -16 and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1, since the prime factors of 16 are 2 and the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 5, resulting in one shared prime"

Next, we perform the Prime Factor counting operation:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Then, we do the Concatenation operation:

618 + 12 - 0

Now, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right:

630 - 0 = 630

The answer is 630.","GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. Parentheses: Calculate the expression inside the parentheses first.
  14 + 4 = 18

2. Prime Factor Counting (F): We don't have any shared prime factors to count between numbers at this stage, so we move on.

3. Exponents: There are no exponents in this expression, so we continue.

4. Multiplication/Division: There are no multiplication or division operations at this stage, so we continue.

5. Addition/Subtraction: Now we have addition and subtraction operations left. We evaluate them from left to right.

6. Addition: 6 @ (18) + 12

7. Concatenation (C): Calculate 6 @ 18

8. Concatenation (C): 6 @ 18 = 618

9. Subtraction: 618 + 12 - 2 # 3

10. Prime Factor Counting (F): Calculate 2 # 3

11. Prime Factor Counting (F): 2 # 3 = 0 (since there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3)

Confidence: 95%.","GPT Response: Let's break down the problem step by step according to the new order of operations.

1. Parentheses: Calculate the expression within the parentheses first, 14 + 4 = 18.
2. Prime Factor Counting (F): Now, we have 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3. Consider the prime factor counting operation, 2 # 3 = 0 (since there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3).

4. Subtraction (S): Conduct the subtraction operation: 618 + 12 - 0.
5. Addition (A): Finally, carry out the addition operation: 618 + 12 = 630.

The answer is 630.","GPT Response: Let's solve the expression step by step, using the PEFMDASC order of operations with a focus on the new operations and their placement:

1. Calculate what is in the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18
2. Concatenation (C): Evaluate 6 @ 18 (left to right): 6 @ 18 = 618
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): Evaluate 2 # 3 = 1 (since the prime factors of 2 are 2 and the prime factors of 3 are 3, with only one shared factor 1)
