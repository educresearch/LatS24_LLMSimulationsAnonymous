mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 with the new order of operations, we need to follow these steps:

1. Prime factor counting (F): 4 # 3 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor is 2)
2. Addition (A): 1 + 2 = 3

Therefore,

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we must follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), which includes the new mathematical operations Concatenation (C) and Prime Factor Counting (F).

Given expression: 4 # 3 + 2

First, we perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation:

Number of unique prime factors shared by absolute values of 4 and 3 is 0 (since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and 3 is a prime number with no shared prime factors). So, 4 # 3 = 0.

Now, the expression becomes: 0 + 2

Next, we perform Addition (A):

0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: First, we need to follow the order of operations and evaluate the prime factor counting (F) before the addition.

4 # 3 + 2
= 1 + 2 (since the prime factors of 4 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3, so there is only 1 shared prime factor, which is ","GPT Response: Let's solve the problem 4 # 3 + 2 using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Calculate 4 # 3. The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since they do not share any prime factors, 4 # 3 = 0.
2. Addition (A): Perform the addition now, as there are no other operations with higher precedence. Add 0 (the result from step 1) to 2: 0 + 2 = 2.

The answer is 2."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations, we need to follow the steps PEFMDASC.

First, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation for 3 and 2, which are already their absolute values. The prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. There are no shared prime factors, so 3 # 2 = 0.

Next, we move on to addition, so we add 5 and 0:

5 + 0 = 5

Therefore, The answer is 5.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow these steps:

1. Perform the Prime Factor Counting operation: 3 # 2
2. Since the prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factor of 2 is 2, they have no shared prime factors, so 3 # 2 is equal to 0.
3. Now, continue with the addition operation: 5 + 0

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to perform the prime factor counting operation (F) since it comes before addition (A).

3 # 2 = 0 (since the only prime factors are 3 for |3| and 2 for |2|, and there are no shared prime factors, i.e., 0.)

Now that we have calculated the prime factor counting operation, we can proceed to addition (A).

5 + 0 = 5

So,

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Let's solve the problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations, with a focus on illustrating the new operations.

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): There are no exponents or parentheses to evaluate first, so we start with prime factor counting. The prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. They do not have any shared prime factors, so 3 # 2 = 0.
2. Addition (A): Now we move on to addition. We have 5 + 0 from the previous step. So, 5 + 0 = 5.

The answer is 5.

Therefore, the solution to 5 + 3#2 is 5."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations, we start by evaluating the concatenation operation since it comes after addition in the order.

So, we have:

5 + 2 @ 4
= 5 + 24 (since 2 @ 4 = 24)

Now, we can perform the addition:

= 29

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to first perform the addition, then the concatenation.

5 + 2 @ 4
= 7 @ 4 (since addition comes before concatenation)
= 74 (since the absolute value of 4 is 4, and concatenating 7 and 4 gives 74)

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: Let's go through the operations one by one, following the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Parentheses: there are none, so we move on.
2. Exponents: there are none, so we move on.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): there are none, so we move on.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): there are none, so we move on.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): we reach this step with the expression 5 + 2 @ 4. Now we need to evaluate the Concatenation operation:
6. Concatenation (C): 5 + 2 @ 4 = 5 + 2 @ 42 (since |2| @ |4| = 24 = 2 @ 4 = 24).

Now we need to follow the order of operations again, starting from step 5 (since we've already performed a Concatenation operation):

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): with the expression 5 + 24, we can now perform addition:
6. Addition (A): 5 + 24 = 29.

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order:

1. There are no Parentheses, Exponents, nor Multiplication or Division in this expression, so we proceed to the next operation in the order.
2. Prime Factor counting (F): There are no absolute values in the expression, and the only candidates for this operation are 2 and 4. However, 2 and 4 have no shared prime factors, so their prime factor count is 0. Thus, 5 + 2 @ 4 = 5 + 0 @ 4.
3. Concatenation (C): Since there are no other operations left to perform before this step, we evaluate the concatenation: 5 + 0 @ 4 = 5 + 4.

The answer is 9."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: Let's go through the order of operations step by step:

1. Parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18
2. Concatenation: 6 @ 18 = 618
3. Prime Factor Counting: 618 # 3 = 0 (since there are no shared prime factors between 618 and 3)

The answer is 0.","GPT Response: Let's go through the operations in the given expression according to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. Parentheses: Calculate the expression inside the parentheses first, which is 14 + 4.
2. No exponents in this expression.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): Calculate the prime factor counting of 6 and 18 (the result of the parentheses).
4. No multiplication or division in this expression.
5. Concatenation (C): Calculate the concatenation of 6 (from 6 @ 18) and 18.
6. No addition or subtraction before this step.

So,

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 (evaluating the parentheses)
= 618 + 12 - 2 # 3 (performing concatenation)

The answer is 0.","GPT Response: First, we follow the order of operations PEFMDASC. 

So, we start with parentheses:

6 @ (14 + 4) = 6 @ 18 = 618

Next, we do the subtraction:

618 + 12 - 2 = 638 - 2 = 636

Finally, we do the prime factor counting:

636 # 3 = 0

The answer is 0.","GPT Response: Let's break down the given expression and solve it step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

2. Now, concatenate 6 and 18: 6 @ 18 = 618
3. Perform the addition and subtraction operations: 12 - 2 = 10
4. Count the prime factors shared between the numbers: 3 # 10 = 0 (since 3 and 10 have no shared prime factors)

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the given order of operations, we first apply the prime factor counting operation (F).

For 8 # 2, since the prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2 and the prime factors of 2 are just 2, there is 1 shared prime factor, which is 2. So, 8 # 2 = 1.

For 6 # 6, since the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 and the prime factors of 6 are also 2 and 3, both factors are shared prime factors, which are 2 and 3. So, 6 # 6 = 2.

Next, we apply the addition operation (A).

8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 2.

Lastly, we have:

6 # 6 = 2 (since the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, so there is one shared prime factor 2).

Therefore, the answer is 4.","GPT Response: For the expression 8#2 + 6#6, we need to follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC). According to this order, Prime Factor Counting (F) should be performed before Addition and Subtraction (A/S).

8 # 2
Prime factors of 8: 2, 2, 2

They share one prime factor 2, so 8 # 2 = 1

Similarly,

6 # 6
Prime factors of 6: 2, 3
Prime factors of 6: 2, 3

They share two prime factors, 2 and 3, so 6 # 6 = 2

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Let's calculate the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 step by step, following the PEFMDASC order of operations.

First, we need to calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) for both 8 # 2 and 6 # 6:

8 # 2 = ?

Prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and prime factors of 2 are 2. Since the only shared prime factor is 2, the result of 8 # 2 is 1.

6 # 6 = ?

Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and prime factors of 6 are again 2 and 3. Since there are two shared prime factors (2 and 3), the result of 6 # 6 is 2.
