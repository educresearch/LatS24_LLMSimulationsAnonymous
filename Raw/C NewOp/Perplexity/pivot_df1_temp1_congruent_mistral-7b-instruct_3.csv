mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: According to the expanded order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to perform prime factor counting before concatenation. However, in this given problem, there are no negative numbers or exponents involved, so the prime factor counting operation will result in 0 for any pair of numbers. Therefore, the sequence of operations simplifies to:

1. Addition (A)
2. Concatenation (C)

Let's apply the operations step-by-step:

1. Perform addition (5 + 2 = 7), but hold the result because we still need to do concatenation.
2. Perform concatenation (7 @ 4).

Since we've performed the addition part earlier, just apply the result (7) and then concatenate it with 4 to get the final answer:

The answer is 74."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to perform the prime factor counting operation. In the given expression, we have 8#2 and 6#6:

1. Prime factor counting:
   a. Find the prime factors of |8| and |2|, which are both equal to 2. Since 2 is the only common prime factor, the count is 1.
   b. Find the prime factors of |6|, which are 2 and 3. Since none of the prime factors are shared, the count is 0.

So, the prime factor counting operation results in 1 for 8#2 and 0 for 6#6.

Now, we add the results according to the order of operations:

Addition (L to R):
The answer is 1."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: The given expression is ""4 # 3 + 2"" which falls under the expanded order of operations PEFMDASC. According to the given rules, we first need to evaluate prime factor counting and then addition.

Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, the prime factor count of their absolute values (which is 2 for both numbers) is 0.

Hence, the addition 3 + 2 should be performed next, resulting in 5. Since there is no concatenation operation in this expression, the final answer is:

The answer is 5."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem with the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to deal with the operations inside the parentheses. This means that we should perform the addition operation between 14 and 4 before applying the Concatenation operation.

1. Calculate 14 + 4: 18

Now that we have the result of the addition operation, we can proceed with the Concatenation operation.

2. Perform Concatenation: 6 @ 18

Next, we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operation (#). Since it comes after Concatenation in the order of operations, we need to perform it before Addition and Subtraction. In this case, the numbers 3 and 6 have no shared prime factors, so the result is 0.

3. Perform the Subtraction operation: 12 - 2

Now we have all the results we need, so we can put them all together in the correct order based on the expanded order of operations (PEFMDASC).

The answer is 0. (Since Concatenation of the final results of all operations is 0, and the final answer is the result of the last mathematical operation performed.)"
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem with the new order of operations, we need to follow the PEFMDASC rule:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Since there are no parentheses, exponents, or concatenation involved, we can skip steps 1, 3, and 6 for this problem.
2. Multiplication and Division (MD): None involved in this problem.
3. Addition and Subtraction (AS): Here, we have the addition sign (+) and the prime factor counting operation (#). According to the rules, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation first, followed by the addition operation.
4. Concatenation (C): None involved in this problem.

Now, let us evaluate the problem:

5 + 3#2

According to the new order of operations, we need to evaluate prime factor counting before addition. Since 3 is a prime number and 2 has the prime factor 2, we have one shared prime factor, hence the prime factor counting operation results in 1.

Now, let us perform the addition:

1 (from prime factor counting) + 3 = 4.

The answer is 4."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem with the newly introduced mathematical operations and updated order of operations, follow the steps below:

1. Parentheses: None in this problem, so we move on to the next operation.
2. Exponents: None in this problem, so we move on to the next operation.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We don't have absolute values or negative numbers, so this operation doesn't apply. Thus, the result of this operation will be 0.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): None in this problem, so we move on to the next operation.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We have addition (5 +) and concatenation (@) in this problem. However, according to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to evaluate addition before concatenation. Therefore, we calculate the sum of 5 and 2 first:
   Sum of 5 and 2 = 7

Next, we perform the concatenation operation:
   Concatenation of 5 and 2 = 5 @ 2 = 52

Hence, the solution to the given mathematics problem using the newly introduced mathematical operations and updated order of operations is:

The answer is 52."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to perform the prime factor counting (F) operation for each number.

For 8, the prime factors are 2 and 2. There are 2 unique prime factors, so we get a count of 2.
For 2, there is only 1 prime factor, so we get a count of 1.

Since 2 is smaller than the count of 8, we follow the order of operations and perform the addition (A) for the two prime factor counts.

So, 8 # 2 = 2 and 6 # 6 = 6

Therefore, 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 2 + 6 = 8.

The answer is 8."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem 4 # 3 + 2 following the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to identify and handle the prime factor counting operation.

Since 4 and 3 are both positive numbers, let us perform prime factor counting (F) first for both numbers:

4 = 2^2
3 = 3^1

Prime factors of 4: 2
Prime factors of 3: 3

Only 1 prime factor, 2, is shared between 4 and 3, so the prime factor counting result is:
4 # 3 = 1.

Now, we move forward in the order of operations and evaluate addition (A) before concatenation (C).

Addition (A):
3 + 2 = 5

With the input values for the original problem, 4 # 3 + 2, now evaluated as 1 (prime factor counting) and 5 (addition), the only remaining operation in our order of operations is concatenation (C).

Concatenation (C):
To perform the concatenation, we combine the Number 1 (result of prime factor counting) and Number 5 (result of addition).
So, 1 and 5 are concatenated as '1' and '5'.

Finally, the result of the concatenation of '1' and '5' is our final answer:

The answer is 15."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we need to follow the newly updated order of operations, which is PEFMDASC. Let's break down the problem and apply each operation in the correct order:

1. Parentheses:
   We have parentheses in the first part of the expression, so we need to evaluate what's inside them first:
   (14 + 4) = 18

2. Exponents:
   We don't have any exponents in this expression, so we can move on to the next operation.

3. Prime Factor Counting:
   We don't have any absolute values or negative numbers in this expression, so prime factor counting doesn't apply.

4. Multiplication and Division:
   We don't have any multiplication or division operations in this expression, so we can proceed to the next operation.

5. Addition and Subtraction:
   We have subtraction in this expression, so we need to evaluate it before concatenation:
   12 - 2 = 10

6. Concatenation:
   We have concatenation in this expression, so we need to evaluate it last:
   6 @ 18 = 618

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 618."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: Based on the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), the solution to the problem 5 + 3#2 would be as follows:

1. First, we need to perform prime factor counting between 3 and 2. Since the absolute values of both numbers are less than 10, and both are positive numbers, they do not have any common prime factors (prime factors of 3 are 3 and 3, and prime factors of 2 are just 2). Therefore, the prime factor counting operation results in 0.

2. Now that we have evaluated the prime factor counting operation, the next operation in our order is addition. So, we add the numbers 5 and 3 together, getting a sum of 8.

The answer is 8."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem with the new mathematical operations and order of operations, we need to follow the PEFMDASC order. That is, Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), and Concatenation.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Since there is only addition in the given expression, we can directly proceed to the next step.
2. Concatenation (C): However, concatenation should be performed after addition based on the given order of operations. So, we need to go back to the addition step and perform concatenation after addition. This is not applicable in this case since there is only one addition.

Therefore, following the PEFMDASC order, the given expression 5+2 @ 4 is equivalent to 5+2 and @ is just an unnecessary symbol in this context as addition and concatenation are incompatible operations.

The answer is: 7 (the sum of 5 and 2)."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to perform the prime factor counting (F) for both numbers 8 and 6.

The prime factors for 8 are 2 and 2 (+1 since 8 is a perfect square), and the prime factors for 6 are 2 and 2. With one common prime factor (2), the prime factor counting is 2.

With the prime factor counting part done, we now move to addition (A) and left-to-right processing:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6
= 0 + 6 # 6 (since prime factor counting comes before addition)
= 6 # 36
= 0 (as there's no common prime factor)

Since the addition operation in this case returned zero, our answer remains 0.

The answer is __.
Answer: 0."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 4 # 3 + 2 using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to apply the prime factor counting operation, which in this case is between two numbers, 4 and 3. Since there are no common prime factors, the prime factor counting operation results in 0.

Now, we have 0 + 2. We can directly perform this addition operation, which results in 2.

Finally, we apply the concatenation operation between the result of the previous step, which is 2, and the number 4. Since concatenation is a left-to-right operation, the final answer is obtained by appending the digit 2 to the number 4.

The answer is 42."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: To solve the problem with the new mathematical operations and the updated order of operations, we need to follow the PEFMDASC rule:

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in this expression, so we move on to the next operation.
2. Exponents: None present, moving on.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): To find the prime factors common to 6 and 14, we have {2, 2, 2, 7} and {2, 7}, so we have one shared prime factor, 2, which gives us a count of 1. To find the prime factors common to 6 and 4, we have {2, 2, 3} and {2}, so we have one shared prime factor, 2. Since we're dealing with concatenation and addition, we'll come back to this step and see how the counts combine.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): We'll hold off on multiplication since there is no addition and concatenation present that we need to handle first.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We cannot perform addition before concatenation, so we'll come back to this step once we've combined the concatenation operation with the PM/DAS operations.
6. Concatenation (C): To concatenate 6 and (14 + 4), we'll first need to perform the addition inside the parentheses.
14 + 4 = 18

So now, we have the expression 6@18 + 12-2.

7. Multiplication and Division (M/D): Since there's no multiplication at the moment, we'll move on.
8. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Since there's only one subtraction, we can perform it now: 12 - 2 = 10
9. Multiplication and Division (M/D): Now, we can perform the multiplication: 6@18 = 618

Now, we'll return to step 3 to combine the F counts: 1 for the 6 and 14, 1 for the 6 and 4. Since the counts are the same, we have a total prime factor count of 2.

10. Concatenation (C): Now, we can perform the concatenation: 618.

So, the final answer is: The answer is 618."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 5 + 3#2, we need to follow the updated order of operations: PEFMDASC. Since there are no parentheses or exponents, we move on to the next operations.

Prime Factor Counting: We perform prime factorization on the given numbers 3 and 2:

- Prime factors of 3: 3
- Prime factors of 2: 2

Since there is only 1 unique prime factor shared between 3 and 2, the prime factor counting operation results in 1. We denote it as '1' for the time being.

Multiplication and Division: Since there's no multiplication or division, we move on to the next operation.

Addition and Subtraction: Our problem is an addition problem. Since we have already performed the prime factor counting operation earlier, we now evaluate the addition:

5 + 1 = 6

Concatenation: Since there's no concatenation in our problem, we can ommit this step.

Therefore, the final answer is 6. The answer is 6."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 2 @ 4 using the PEFMDASC order, follow these steps:

Step 1: Parentheses
There are no parentheses in this expression, so we can move on to the next operation.

Step 2: Exponents
There are no exponents in this expression, so we can move on to the next operation.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
We don't have the absolute values of 5, 2, and 4 to perform prime factor counting. Since prime factor counting comes before addition and concatenation, we cannot proceed with this expression as it is given.

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
There are no multiplication or division operations in this expression, so we can move on to the next operation.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
We cannot apply addition and subtraction directly since there is a concatenation symbol (@) present in the expression. We need to handle this operation first to get a single number before performing addition.

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
Since concatenation is the next operation in the PEFMDASC order, we will perform it now.

2 @ 4 = 24 (since we cannot concatenate a number with a digit, so we assume we have absolute values |2| = 2 and |4| = 4, and the result is their concatenation).

Now that we have the number 24, we can perform the addition operation.

Step 7: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
5 + 24 = 29

The answer is 29."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 8#2 + 6#6 using the PEFMDASC order, follow these steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting: First, we need to find the prime factor counts for numbers 8 and 6.
   - For 8, the prime factors are 2, 2, 2, and 2 (4 twos). So, 8 # 2 = 0.
   - For 6, the prime factors are 2 and 3. So, 6 # 6 = 1 (one shared prime factor 2).

2. Multiplication: Since there is no multiplication operation in the problem, we can skip this step.

3. Division: Since there is no division operation in the problem, we can skip this step.

4. Exponents: There is no exponent in the problem, so we can skip this step.

5. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in the problem, so we can skip this step.

6. Concatenation: Next, we perform the concatenation. Since there is no addition or subtraction operation involved, we can directly perform the concatenation of the results we got from prime factor counting.
   - For 8#2: 0
   - For 6#6: 1

   We cannot concatenate numbers directly, so we need to convert them into their string form first: 0 and 1.
   Now concatenate these strings: '0' @ '1' = '01'

7. Addition and Subtraction: None in the current problem. So, we can skip this step.

The answer is 01."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, follow these steps:

1. First, perform the prime factor counting (F) between the absolute values of the numbers 4 and 3:
   Since prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 and prime factors of 3 are 3, there are no shared prime factors. So, the prime factor counting is 0.

2. Next, since there is neither multiplication nor division in this expression, we move on to addition and subtraction (AS):
   We have 2 operations in the order given: '+' and '#'. According to the order of operations given (PEFMDASC), we should perform concatenation (C) before addition (AS). However, in this case, both operations are different, so we cannot directly follow the order, and we should break the rule, as the expression uses addition and not concatenation.

3. So, we perform the addition (AS): 
   4 + 2 = 6

4. Now that we have the result of the addition, we perform the concatenation (C) operation:
    Since we added 2 and 4 to get 6, we have 6. However, according to the rules of concatenation given (there is no number '6' representation in the given examples), the digits of the numbers 4 and 3 are concatenated together, which is 43.

5. Finally, since there are no more operations left, the answer using the PEFMDASC order is: The answer is 43.

Note: Although we had to break the rule of performing concatenation before addition in this specific problem due to the nature of the given expression, the main idea behind following PEFMDASC order is to ensure a consistent and clear evaluation order throughout any mathematical expression."

Step 1: Parentheses
Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first: 14 + 4 = 18

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting
Ignore the @ symbol for now as it comes last. First, perform prime factor counting on the absolute values of the numbers involved:
For 18: 2^2 * 3
For 6: 2 * 3

Step 3: Exponents
Ignore the @ symbol and prime factor counting for now. No exponents in this expression.

Step 4: Multiplication and Division
There are no multiplication or division operations, so we move on to the next operation in the order.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
First, perform the subtraction operation: 12 - 2 = 10
Next, perform the addition operation: 6 @ 18 + 10

Step 6: Concatenation
Lastly, perform the concatenation operation: 6 @ (18) = 618

1. Parentheses: We already have the expression enclosed in parentheses, so no operations are needed here.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents in the expression.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): For the term 3#2, we find the prime factor count of the absolute values of both numbers.
   Prime factors of 3: 3
   Prime factors of 2: 2
   Since both numbers have 2 as a prime factor, the prime factor count is 1.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There are no multiplication or division operations in the expression.
