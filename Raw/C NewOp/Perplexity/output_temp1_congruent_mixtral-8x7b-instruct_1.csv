4. Multiplication and Division: None so far.

7. Prime Factor counting:

                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e.,

                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

Given expression: 4 # 3 + 2

First, we perform Prime Factor Counting (F):
4 # 3 = 2 (since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and of 3 are 3, and they share no common prime factors, the result is 0, but since we are counting unique prime factors, it is 1)

According to this order, Prime Factor Counting (F) should be performed before Addition (A).

First, let's calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) for both 8 and 2:

The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. There is one shared prime factor (2), so 8#2 equals 1.

Next, let's calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) for both 6 and 6:

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. There are two shared prime factors (2 and 3), so 6#6 equals 2.

Now, we can apply Addition (A) to these results:

1 (from 8#2) + 2 (from 6#6) = 3

Therefore, the answer is 3."

First, calculate 3#2. The prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since there are no shared prime factors, 3#2 = 0.

Then, perform the addition.

5 + 0 = 5

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)

                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

1. First, calculate the expression inside the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18.
2. Now, concatenate 6 and 18: 6 @ 18 = 618.
3. Perform the subtraction: 12 - 2 = 10.
4. Perform the prime factor counting operation: 3 # 10. Prime factors of 3 are 3 and prime factors of 10 are 2 and 5. Since there are no shared prime factors, 3 # 10 = 0.
5. Finally, add the results obtained in steps 2 and 4: 618 + 0 = 618.

The answer is 618."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
