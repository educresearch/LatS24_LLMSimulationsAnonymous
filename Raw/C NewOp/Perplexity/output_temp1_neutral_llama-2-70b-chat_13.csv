systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelllama-2-70b-chat_temp1_maxtoken700,llama-2-70b-chat,1,700,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

                    (i) 5 @ 3 + 6

                    (ii) 5 # 3 + 6
                    = 0 + 6 (since we need to evaluate prime factorization before addition)
                    = 6

                    (iii) 5 - 3 @ 6
                    = 2 @ 6 (since we need to evaluate subtraction before concatenation)
                    = 26

                    (iv) 5 - 3 # 6
                    = 5 - 1 (since we need to evaluate prime factorization before subtraction)
                    = 4

                    (vi) (3 + 10 # 2) * 5 @ 42 
                    = (3 + 1) * 5 @ 42 (we need to evaluate what is in the parenthesis first and prime factor counting is before addition)

                    = 20 @ 42 = 2042. (concatenation is last)

1. Parentheses: Inside the parentheses we have 14 + 4 = 18
2. Exponents (none in this case)
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): Not applicable in this case
4. Multiplication/Division (left to right): 6 @ 18 = 108
5. Addition/Subtraction (left to right): 108 + 12 = 120
6. Concatenation (C): Not applicable in this case

The answer is 120.

Let's also verify the correctness of the answer by checking the calculation using the traditional order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Parentheses: Inside the parentheses we have 14 + 4 = 18
2. Exponents (none in this case)
3. Multiplication/Division (left to right): 6 @ 18 = 108
4. Addition/Subtraction (left to right): 108 + 12 = 120
5. Concatenation (C): Not applicable in this case

Indeed, we get the same answer using either order of operations, which confirms the correctness of our calculation."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.
