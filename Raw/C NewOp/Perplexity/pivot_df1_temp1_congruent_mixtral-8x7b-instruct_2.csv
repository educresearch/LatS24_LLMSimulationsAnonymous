mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow these steps:

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in this problem, so we move on to the next operation.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this problem, so we move on to the next operation.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): There are no prime factor counting operations in this problem, so we move on to the next operation.
4. Multiplication and Division (M and D, from left to right): There are no multiplication or division operations in this problem, so we move on to the next operation.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A and S, from left to right): We have an addition operation: 5 + 2. We perform this operation first.
   - 5 + 2 = 7
6. Concatenation (C, from left to right): We now have a concatenation operation: 7 @ 4. However, since there is no absolute value sign around 7, we must preserve its sign. So we concatenate -7 and 4 instead of simply 7 and 4.
   - (-7) @ 4 = -74

Therefore, the answer is -74."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve the expression $8 \# 2 + 6 \# 6$ using the expanded order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to perform the prime factor counting operation first, then the addition.

The prime factors of $8$ are $2 \times 2 \times 2$, and the prime factors of $2$ are $2$. Therefore, $8 \# 2 = 3$.

The prime factors of $6$ are $2 \times 3$, and the prime factors of $6$ are $2 \times 3$. Therefore, $6 \# 6 = 2$.

So, the expression becomes $3 + 2$.

Finally, we perform addition:

$3 + 2 = 5$

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: Let's break down the problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. Parentheses: Calculate the expression inside the parentheses first: 14 + 4 = 18.
2. Concatenation: Since concatenation is next in the order of operations, calculate 6 @ 18: 6 @ 18 = 618.
3. Prime Factor Counting: The problem has another operation (subtraction) before we reach the prime factor counting operation; therefore, evaluate the subtraction first: 12 - 2 = 10.
4. Prime Factor Counting: Now, calculate 3 # 10. The prime factors of 3 are 3 and of 10 are 2 and 5, so 3 and 10 have no shared prime factors: 3 # 10 = 0.

Now we have completed all the operations:

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve the expression $8 \mathbin{\#} 2 + 6 \mathbin{\#} 6$, we first need to count the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of each pair of numbers.

For $8 \mathbin{\#} 2$, the prime factors of $8$ are $2$ and $2$, and the prime factors of $2$ are $2$. Therefore, the only shared prime factor is $2$, so $8 \mathbin{\#} 2 = 1$.

For $6 \mathbin{\#} 6$, the prime factors of $6$ are $2$ and $3$, and the prime factors of $6$ are also $2$ and $3$. Therefore, the shared prime factors are $2$ and $3$, so $6 \mathbin{\#} 6 = 2$.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. Since there are no parentheses or exponents in the expression, we proceed to the next operation in the order, which is Prime Factor Counting (F). However, in this particular expression, there are no appearances of the prime factor counting operation (#).
2. The next operation in the order is Multiplication and Division (M/D), but neither of these operations appears in the expression.
3. We now move on to Addition and Subtraction (A/S), and we see that there is an addition operation (5 + 2). So, let's perform this operation first:
   - 5 + 2 = 7
4. The next (and final) operation in the order is Concatenation (C). We see that there is a concatenation operation (2 @ 4) in the expression. Now, we should perform this concatenation:
