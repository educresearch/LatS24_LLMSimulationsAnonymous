Exponents: In this problem, there are no exponents, so we can skip this step.<br><br>3.

However, there is a division-like operation represented by the @ symbol. We know that we cannot perform concatenation (C) before addition and subtraction (AS), so we cannot use the given order of operations directly to solve this problem. Instead, we need to move the @ symbol to the right side of the addition sign, as follows:<br><br>5 + 2@4<br> becomes<br> 5 + 2 @ 4<br><br>Since we cannot use prime factor counting before addition and subtraction (AS), we need to move the @ symbol before the addition sign again:<br>5 + 2 @ 4<br><br>Now, we have the @ symbol between the numbers, not as a part of an arithmetic operation.

      <td>GPT Response: To solve the given expression with the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to focus on the prime factor counting operation (F) and parentheses (P), as they take priority. In this case, we only have parentheses. So, let's evaluate them:<br><br>There are no parentheses in the given expression, 5 + 3 # 2, so we can proceed without evaluating any parentheses.

Prime Factor Counting (F): To evaluate # operation, we need to find the unique prime factors that are shared by both 5 and 3, but there are no common prime factors between these numbers, so # operation between 5 and 3 results in 0.<br>3.

Concatenation<br><br>Since there are no parentheses or exponents in this problem, we'll skip the first two steps.<br><br>Next, we need to perform prime factor counting (F) to find the unique prime factors common to 5 and 3, as well as 2. Since the prime factors of 5 are 5 and 1, and the prime factors of 3 are 3 and 1, the prime factors of 2 are 2, the common prime factors are 1 and 2. So, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 2. In other words, 5 # 3 # 2 = 2.<br><br>Since prime factor counting was involved, we need to account for its result before carrying out any other arithmetic operations.

In the given expression, we have numbers 3, 2, and no symbols of addition or concatenation yet, so we can't apply any of the new operations just yet. Prime Factor Counting (F) can only be applied when we have numbers, and it comes before addition and subtraction in the order of operations.
