      <td>GPT Response: Let's solve the problem using the revised order of operations, PEFMDASC:<br><br>1. Check for parentheses: There are no parentheses in the expression, so we can move on to the next step.<br>2. Calculate exponents: There are no exponents in the expression, so we can move on to the next step.<br>3. Perform Prime Factor counting (F):<br>   a # b calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b.<br><br>   In this case, we have 3 # 2. So we need to find the prime factors of |3| and |2| first, which are 3 and 2 respectively. Then we look for shared prime factors between them and count how many there are. In this case, 3 and 2 have no shared prime factors, so the count is 0.<br><br>4. Perform Multiplication and Division (if any) from left to right, and then Addition and Subtraction (if any) from left to right: However, in this problem, since there are no multiplication, division, addition, or subtraction between the prime factor counting, we don't need to do steps 4-6 anymore.<br>5. Perform Concatenation (C) from left to right: There are no other concatenation operations left in the expression.<br><br>The answer is 5 + 3 # 2 = 5 + 0 = 5.</td>
