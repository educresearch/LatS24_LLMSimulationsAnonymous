mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression 5 + 2 @ 4, we need to follow the newly defined order of operations, which is PEFMDASC.

First, let's identify the operations present and their precedence based on the order of operations:

1. + (Addition): L to R (Last to Right)
2. @ (Concatenation): L to R (Last to Right)

Since neither of the operations is inside parentheses or an exponent, we proceed with the prescribed order, which is Addition and then Concatenation.

First, perform the addition operation: 5 + 2 = 7

Next, we apply the concatenation operation 2 @ 4 = 24.

Finally, we evaluate the concatenation result with the sum: 7 @ 24 = 724

So the answer is: The answer is 724."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematical expression with the new operations and order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow the rule: Parentheses first, then exponents, followed by prime factor counting, and after that, multiplication and division from left to right, addition and subtraction from left to right, and at last concatenation.

Here's the step-by-step solution for the given expression: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): First, we calculate the prime factor count for each number.

   a) For number 8: Prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2.
   b) For number 2: Prime factor of 2 is 2.
   c) For number 6: Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.

2. Comparing the unique prime factors of each number, we count the number of shared prime factors.

   Here, we have 2 shared between 8 and 2, and 2 shared between 2 and 6. This gives us a count of 2.

3. Addition (A): Now, we add the result of prime factor counting to the first number in the original expression. However, since we still have the concatenation operation (C) to follow, we store the result for now.

4. Concatenation (C): Finally, we perform the concatenation operation on the results of the number obtained after addition. Here, we have 8 and the result of prime factor counting (2).

The answer is 82.

So, The answer is 82."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: According to the new order of operations PEFMDASC, the first step is to perform prime factor counting (F). In this case, the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, their prime factor counting operation results in 0.

Next, we move on to addition (S). Since 0 is a neutral element for addition, 0 + 2 equals 2.

So, following the updated order of operations, the solution to 4 # 3 + 2 is:

The answer is 2."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression using the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to follow the rules and perform the operations in the given order:

1. Parentheses: (14 + 4)
   = 18

2. Prime Factor Counting: 6 # 18
   = 1 (since the prime factorization of 6 is {2, 3} and the prime factorization of 18 is {2, 2, 2, 3}, there is only one shared prime factor 2)

3. Multiplication and Division (L to R): We don't have any multiplication or division in this expression.

4. Addition and Subtraction (L to R): 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2
   = 6 @ 102 + 12 - 2 (since we need to evaluate the concatenation before the addition and subtraction)
   = 651 + 12 - 2

5. Concatenation: 651 @ 12 - 2
   = 6512 - 2 (we perform subtraction before concatenation)
   = 6508

The answer is 6508."

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression using the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to follow the given sequence:

Parentheses: In this expression, there are no parentheses. So we move on to the next step.

Exponents: There is no exponent in this expression. We move on to the next step.

Prime Factor Counting (F): This operation is not involved in this expression, so we move on to the next step.

Multiplication and Division (M/D): There is no multiplication or division in this expression. We move on to the next step.

Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We see that there is addition and one concatenation operation @. Addition is performed before concatenation, as per the updated order, so we first evaluate the addition:

5 + 2 = 7 (Now we have 7 and 4 to concatenate)

Concatenation (C): Finally, we perform the concatenation of 7 and 4:

7 @ 4 = 74

The answer is 74."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the given Mathematics problem according to the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to deal with the prime factor counting operations. So, let's evaluate the prime factor counting part:

8 # 2 = 2 (since the prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2, and those of 2 are 2)
6 # 2 = 1 (since the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, while 2 is not a prime factor of 2)
6 # 2 = 2 (since the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and those of 2 are 2)
So, the prime factor counting operations evaluate to 2.

Now, as the addition comes before prime factor counting in the new order, let's evaluate it:

8 # 2 + 6 # 2
= 2 + 6 # 2
= 8 # 2 (we need to combine the numbers before the # sign for prime factor counting)
= 2 (prime factor counting)
= 2 + 6 (since we have done the prime factor counting)
= 8 (since adding 2 to 6)

So, the final answer is: The answer is 8."

Therefore, the solution to the problem 5 + 3 # 2, following the newly updated order of operations, is:

The answer is 8."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the problem, we first need to follow the updated order of operations: PEFMDASC. In this case, there are no parentheses, so we move on to the next operation.

Exponents: None present.
Prime Factor Counting: A and @ have no prime factors, so their prime factor counts are 0 when concatenated.

Multiplication and Division (left to right): None present.
Addition and Subtraction (left to right): We are dealing with addition, so no division or Subtraction is involved.

Concatenation (left to right): We have a situation where concatenation is involved, specifically @ operator. To solve this, we need to evaluate the additions first, as they have a higher precedence than the @ operator. Given the problem is 5 + 2 @ 4, we first calculate 5 + 2 = 7. Now with our result of 7, we can perform the @ operation, resulting in concatenating the digits: 7 @ 4 = 74.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem with the new mathematical operations and order of operations, we need to follow the updated order of operations: PEFMDASC.

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): We first count the unique prime factors common to both |8| and |2| and to |6| and |6|. The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 2 and 6 are only 2. Since there is one common prime factor, we have: 8 # 2 = 1 and 6 # 6 = 1.

2. Multiplication and Division (MD): Since we don't have any multiplication or division in our expression, we move on to the next step;

3. Concatenation (C): Since we have the @ symbol in our expression, we apply the concatenation operation. We can combine the results with the prime factor counting we already got: 1 + 1 = 2. So now, we have 8 @ 2 = 82 and 6 @ 6 = 66.

In conclusion, our expression becomes 82 + 66. We still have the addition left, which is the last operation in our updated order of operations PEFMDASC.

4. Addition and Subtraction (AS): Perform the addition operation: 82 + 66 = 148.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations: Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting, Multiplication and Division (left to right), Addition and Subtraction (left to right), and Concatenation (left to right). In this problem, there are no parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, or concatenation, so we can directly proceed with prime factor counting and addition.

First, let's find the unique prime factors common to |3| and |2|. Prime factors for 3 are 3, and for 2 are 2. Since both 2 and 3 appear as prime factors, the prime factor counting operation results in 1.

Now, let's move on to addition. We have the numbers 5 and the result of the prime factorization operation, which in this case is 1. We can add these values directly:

5 + 1 = 6

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 2 @ 4 using the revised order of operations PEFMDASC, follow these steps:

1. Identify and solve any operations enclosed in parentheses: In this case, there are no parentheses, so we move on to the next step.

2. Perform any exponentiation: There is no exponentiation in this expression.

3. Calculate prime factor counting: In this case, prime factor counting is not applicable as there are no numbers with absolute values greater than 1 involved.

4. Multiply and Divide (perform from left to right): We cannot apply this step as there is no multiplication or division in the given expression.

5. Add and Subtract (perform from left to right): First, let's add the numbers 5 and 2: 5 + 2 = 7.
Then, perform the concatenation operation: Since there's only one number (7) in this expression, we'll simply concatenate a 0 at the end because every number must have at least one digit when using the concatenation operation: 7 @ 0 = 70.

Now, we have all the necessary steps to find the final answer, as required:

The answer is 70."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to first focus on prime factor counting (#), then addition (A), and finally concatenation (C).

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (#)
We perform prime factor counting on each pair of numbers:

1) For 8 and 2: 
   The prime factorization of 8 is 2 x 2 x 2 x 2, which has a total of 3 unique prime factors: 2.
   The prime factorization of 2 is just 2 itself, which also has 1 unique prime factor: 2.
   Therefore, 8 # 2 equals 3.

2) For 6 and 6:
   The prime factorization of 6 is 2 x 3 x 2. It has 2 unique prime factors: 2 and 3.
   As the prime factorization of 6 is the same, they share 2 prime factors, so 6 # 6 equals 2.

Step 2: Addition (A)
Now, add the results we obtained from the prime factor counting step:

The answer is 3 + 2 = 5.

Step 3: Concatenation (C)
Since we have the result of addition and the original numbers, we can now perform concatenation on those results:

8 # 2 = 3, 6 # 6 = 2
So, 3 (the result from # operation with 8 and 2) is concatenated with 2 (the result from # operation with 6 and 6):

The final answer is 32 (or 3_2 when written in a more readable way).

The answer is 32."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 4 # 3 + 2 using the revised order of operations (PEFMDASC), follow these steps:

Step 1: Prime factor counting (#)
Since the problem includes the new operation #, we'll begin with it:

1. The absolute values of 4 and 3 are 4 and 3 respectively.
2. The unique prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (since 4 = 2 * 2 * 1). The unique prime factors of 3 are 3.
3. There is only one prime factor, 2, shared between 2 and 3.
4. Therefore, 4 # 3 = 1.

Step 2: Addition (+)
Now we move on to the addition:

1. According to the PEFMDASC order, we should perform concatenation (C) afterward, but since there is no concatenation symbol in the given expression, we proceed with this problem without worrying about C yet.
2. To do the addition, we need to find the sum of the numbers involved: 4 + 2 = 6.

So, the calculation is done. According to the given problem, 4 # 3 + 2:

1. The prime factor count of 4 and 3 is 1.
2. The sum of 4 and 2 is 6.

The answer is 1 + 6 = 7."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we'll follow these steps:

1. Parentheses: Solve the expression inside the parentheses first:
14 + 4 = 18

2. Exponents: None present in the problem

3. Prime Factor Counting: We'll calculate prime factor counts for the absolute values of 6, 18, 12, and 3.

6 = 2 * 3, prime factors: 2, 3
18 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 3, prime factors: 2, 2, 3, 3
12 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 3, prime factors: 2, 2, 2, 2, 3
3 = 3, prime factor: 3

Now we have to compare prime factors and find the count of the unique prime factors shared between them:

6 and 18: only the prime factor 2 is common, so the count is 1.
6 and 12: four prime factors are common (2, 2, 2, 3), so the count is 4.
18 and 12: the same four prime factors are common, so the count is 4.
6 and 3: none of the prime factors are common, so the count is 0.
12 and 3: none of the prime factors are common, so the count is 0.

So, we have 1 for 6 @ 18, 4 for 6 @ 12, and 0 for -2 # 3.

4. Multiplication and Division (left to right):
We have one multiplication operation, which is between concatenation and subtraction; so, we'll perform it next:

18 (result from step 1) @ 6 (from step 3) = 114

5. Addition and Subtraction (left to right):
We have one addition and two subtraction operations. Let's tackle addition first:

114 (from step 4) + 12 (given) = 126

Now, we'll tackle the subtractions:

126 (from step 5) - 2 (given) = 124

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 124."

4. Perform multiplication and division (from left to right): None in this expression.
5. Perform addition and subtraction (from left to right): 5
