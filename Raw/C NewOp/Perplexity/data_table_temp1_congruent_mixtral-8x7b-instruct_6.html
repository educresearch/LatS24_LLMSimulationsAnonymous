Then, we apply the prime factor counting operation: 10 # 3 = 1 (since 10 has prime factors 2 and 5, and 3 has no prime factors in common with 10).<br>5. Finally, we apply the concatenation operation (which is last due to the order of operations) to the results of steps 2 and 4: 618 # 1 = 0 (since 618 and 1 have no prime factors in common).<br><br>The answer is 0.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Let's tackle this problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations:<br><br>1. Parentheses: Calculate the expression inside the parentheses first, 14 + 4, since multiplication and addition are in the same level, we can solve from left to right.<br>Result: 18<br>2. Prime Factor counting (F): Identify the prime factors of 6, they are 2 and 3. But for this part of the operation, # 3, we don't need to calculate the prime factors of 3, as there's no shared prime factor between 6 and 3. The result is 0.<br>Result: 0<br>3. Concatenation (C): Perform the concatenation of 0 (from step 2) and 12, since subtraction is at the same level as concatenation in the order.<br>Result: 012 = 12<br>4. Subtraction: Perform the subtraction 12 - 2.<br>Result: 10<br>5.
