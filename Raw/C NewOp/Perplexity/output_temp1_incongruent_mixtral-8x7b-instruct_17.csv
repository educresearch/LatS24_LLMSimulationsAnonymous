1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in this problem, so we can move on to the next step.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this problem, so we can move on to the next step.
3. Prime Factor counting (F): There are no prime factorizations to count in this problem, so we can move on to the next step.
4. Multiplication and Division (L to R): There are no multiplication or division operations in this problem, so we can move on to the next step.
5. Addition and Subtraction (L to R): We have an addition operation (5 + 2), but we still need to evaluate the concatenation operation (2@4) first, since it comes before addition in the order of operations.
6. Concatenation (C): 2@4 = 24. So, the problem becomes 5 + 24.

1. Parentheses: Calculate the expression inside the parentheses first.
   - 14 + 4 = 18
2. Prime Factor counting (F): We cannot proceed to this step yet as there are no numbers with the same absolute value for us to apply the prime factor counting operation.
3. Multiplication/Division (M/D): There are no multiplication or division operations in the problem at this point.
4. Addition/Subtraction (A/S): We cannot proceed to this step yet as we still need to apply the prime factor counting operation.
5. Concatenation (C): We cannot proceed to this step yet as we still need to apply the prime factor counting operation.

Now let's go back and apply the prime factor counting operation (F) wherever possible:

2. Prime Factor counting (F):
   - There are no shared prime factors between 6 and 18, so 6 # 18 = 0.

Now, we have:

0 + 12 - 2#3

                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

In this expression, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we can skip those steps. The next operation is prime factor counting (F), but there are no prime factor counting operations in our expression. Therefore, we move on to multiplication and division (M/D), but there are no multiplication or division operations in our expression either.

Next, we have addition and subtraction (A/S), and there is an addition operation in our expression, $5 + 2$. However, since concatenation (C) is listed after addition and subtraction (A/S) in the order of operations, and there is a concatenation operation in our expression, $2 @ 4$, we must perform the concatenation operation before the addition operation.

Therefore, we first calculate $2 @ 4$. The result is $24$, since the digits of $|2|$ and $|4|$ are $2$ and $4$, which are concatenated to form $24$.

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

1. First, evaluate the expression in the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18
2. Next, perform the Concatenation (C) operation: 6 @ 18 = 618
3. Now, perform the Addition (A) operation: 618 + 12 = 630
4. Next, perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation: 2 # 3 = 1 (since 2 is a prime factor of 2, but not of 3, so they share only one prime factor)
