llama-2-70b-chat,1,700,systemPrompt4,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's the step-by-step explanation for 8 # 2+6 # 6 using the PEFMDASC order:

1. Evaluate the first prime factor counting operation: 8 # 2 = 2
2. Evaluate the second prime factor counting operation: 6 # 6 = 2
3. Evaluate the addition operation: 2 + 2 = 4
4. Evaluate the concatenation operation: 4 @ 6 = 406

The answer is 406.

Here's a breakdown of each step:

1. The first operation is 8 # 2, which is a prime factor counting operation. We need to find the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 8 and 2. The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 1, and the prime factors of 2 are 2 and 1. Since there are two shared prime factors, 2 and 1, the result of 8 # 2 is 2.
2. The second operation is 6 # 6, which is also a prime factor counting operation. The prime factors of 6 are 2, 3, and 1, and the prime factors of 6 are the same, 2, 3, and 1. Therefore, the result of 6 # 6 is 2.
3. The third operation is 2 + 2, which is an addition operation. The result of this operation is 4.
4. The fourth operation is 4 @ 6, which is a concatenation operation. We need to join the digits of |4| and |6| together. The result of this operation is 406.
