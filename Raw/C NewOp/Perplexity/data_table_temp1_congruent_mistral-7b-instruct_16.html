      <td>GPT Response: To solve the given problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to identify which operations need to be performed first. In this case, there are no parentheses, exponents, or prime factor counting involved. Therefore, we move on to the next operations in order: multiplication and division (L to R), addition and subtraction (L to R), and concatenation (L to R).<br><br>Since addition and concatenation have the same precedence in this order of operations, we need to identify which operation should be performed first according to the associativity rules. In general, "+", "-", "@" are right-associative operators. This means that they should be applied from right to left, when they appear next to each other.<br><br>According to this rule, the infix expression "5 + 2 @ 4" should be rewritten as "5 + (2 @ 4)".<br><br>Now applying the new order of operations:<br><br>1.
