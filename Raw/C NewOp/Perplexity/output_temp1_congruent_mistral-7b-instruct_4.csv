                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)

In this case, we only have concatenation (C) and addition (A) operations. Hence, the order simplifies to C and A.

According to the problem, we first perform the concatenation operation and then perform the addition operation. This follows the C and A positions in the updated order of operations.

Given expression: 4 # 3 + 2

First, we perform the prime factor counting operation (#) between 4 and 3:

1 (There is only one prime factor 2 in the factorization of 4 and 2 in the factorization of 3)

Since # is not included in the final calculation, we move ahead and apply the concatenation operation:

Step 1: Concatenate 4 and 3: 4_3

Now, the last operation remaining is the addition operation (+).

Step 2: Add the digits in the result of concatenation:

4 + 3 = 7

So, the solution to the problem 4 # 3 + 2 is to concatenate 4 and 3, obtaining 4_3, and then add the resulting digits: 7.

The answer is 7."

In this problem, we are given the expression 5 + 3 # 2.

First, we need to evaluate prime factor counting (F) since it comes before all other operations. However, in this case, the prime factor counting operation only includes the digits 2, 3, and itself.  So the prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since there is no common prime factor between 2 and 3, we get 0 for the outcome of this operation.

Now, we can focus on the addition (A). Since addition comes before concatenation (C) in the updated order of operations, we need to evaluate the addition first. So the problem becomes:

5 + 0

Since 0 is the additive identity, we get 5 as the final result.

                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a@b, this operation merges the digits of |a| and |b|. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a@b = |a|@|b| = |12|@|-56| = 12@56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a@b = 0@24 = 024 = 24.
                    Please make sure you understand this properly; it's simple yet fundamental.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted as a#b, it counts the unique prime factors common to |a| and |b|. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

1. Parentheses: We have one pair of parentheses, which contains the expression 14 + 4. We need to evaluate this expression first:
   14 + 4 = 18

2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this expression, so we move on to the next operation.

3. Prime Factor Counting: We have the concatenation symbol @ and the prime factor counting symbol #. However, we need to evaluate concatenation before prime factor counting, as per the updated order of operations. So, let's evaluate the concatenation first:

6 @ 18 = 618

4. Multiplication and Division (left to right): We have multiplication and division but no addition or subtraction yet. Multiplication takes precedence over division, so let's evaluate the multiplication operation if there is any:

There is no multiplication operation between the symbols, so we move on to the next operation.

5. Addition and Subtraction (left to right): Now we have addition and subtraction. We need to evaluate them from left to right. We have subtraction before addition:

12 - 2 = 10

6. Concatenation: Now we have the concatenation symbol # between two numbers. However, we need to evaluate concatenation before prime factor counting, as per the updated order of operations. So, let's evaluate the concatenation first:

6 # 3 = 0 (there are no shared prime factors between 6 and 3)

7. Prime Factor Counting: We have prime factor counting between the two numbers, so let's evaluate it:

- For 6: prime factors are 2 and 3.
- For 3: prime factors are 3.

Since there is no shared prime factor, the prime factor counting operation results in 0.

6#6 = 3 (The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, while the prime factors of 6 are 2, 2, and 3. Three unique prime factors are shared between the two numbers.)

Step 2: Since there are parentheses, evaluate the expressions inside them first. In this case, there are none.

Step 3: Perform exponentiation (E) if there are any exponents. In this expression, there are none.

Step 4: Perform prime factor counting (F) for the given expression.

Since there are no parentheses, exponents, or prime factor counting inside the main expression yet, this step does not apply.

Step 5: Perform division and multiplication (M/D) from left to right.

There are no division or multiplication operations given in the expression, so we skip this step.

Step 6: Perform addition and subtraction (A/S) from left to right.

The expression now only has addition operations: 0 + 3 (from the results of the prime factor counting performed in step 1).

Finding the prime factors of 4 and 3:

Since there is no shared prime factor between 4 and 3, the count is 0. So, 4 # 3 = 0.

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
First, let's calculate the prime factor count of 3 and 2:

- Prime factors of 2: 2

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting of 3 and 2 (F)
The expression inside the parenthesis, 3#2, represents the prime factor count of 3 and 2:
- Prime factors of 3: 3
- Prime factors of 2: 2

Since 3 and 2 have only one prime factor in common, the result of the prime factor counting operation is zero: 0 + (joining 5 and 0)
