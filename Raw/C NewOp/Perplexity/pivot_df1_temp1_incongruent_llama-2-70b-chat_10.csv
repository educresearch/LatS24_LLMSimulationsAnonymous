 Using the PEFMDASC order of operations, we have:

1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:

8 # 2 = 8 # 2 + 0 (since there are no shared prime factors between 8 and 2)

2. Evaluate the next expression inside the parentheses:

6 # 6 = 6 # 6 + 0 (since there are no shared prime factors between 6 and 6)

3. Concatenate the results of steps 1 and 2:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 + 0 (since there are no shared prime factors between 8 and 6)

4. Evaluate the expression outside the parentheses:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 10 + 0 (since there is only one shared prime factor between 8 and 6, which is 2)
