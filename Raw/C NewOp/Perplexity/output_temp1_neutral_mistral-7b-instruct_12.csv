1. 8 = 2³ x 2³
2. 2 = 2

Then, we check for shared prime factors. 8 and 2 share prime factor 2 (count = 2). Given that 2 is already a prime factor, the count remains 2.

Now, we move on to the next step in the order of operations, which is multiplication or division (M and D). There's no division in the expression, so multiplication comes first, which is not applicable here since there's only addition and concatenation in the given expression, and the next operations in the order of precedence are addition and subtraction (AS).

Since both numbers 8 and 6 have the same prime factor '2', we apply the prime factor counting operation, but this time between 6 and 2. Since there are no shared prime factors between 6 and 2, the prime factor counting operation (#) returns 0.

Now, we have reached the final operation in the order of precedence which is concatenation. Since there is nothing in the brackets or exponents, the concatenation takes place as the last operation:

Therefore, we proceed to calculate the prime factor counts of the numbers 4 and 3, which are 2 and 2, respectively. Since the same prime factor 2 is shared by both numbers, the value of the prime factor counting operation is 2.

2. Prime Factor Counting: Since there isn't an addition or subtraction inside the parentheses, we'll go ahead and apply concatenation instead:

3. Concatenation:

In this problem, there are no parentheses, exponent, or division, so we start with prime factor counting (F), multiplication and division (M/D), addition and subtraction (A/S), and concatenation (C) in that order.

1. Prime factor counting (F): Since there are no negative numbers or multiplying numbers given, prime factor counting does not apply. We move on to the next operation.
2. Multiplication and Division (M/D): None is present in the given expression, we move on to the next operation.
3. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): In our given expression, there is an addition sign and two numbers, 5 and 2 @ 4. Since we need to evaluate addition before concatenation, we first find the result of 2 @ 4, which is 24.
4. Concatenation (C): Since we have evaluated the addition before concatenation, we can now concatenate the digits of the numbers. In our case, this means placing the digit(s) of the first number before the digit(s) of the second number. So, we concatenate 5 and 24, which gives us 524.

Therefore, the solution to the given problem, following the newly updated order of operations, is as follows:

5 + 2 @ 4 = 5 + (2 #### 4) = 5 + 24 = 29 (However, since concatenation is now a left-associative operation and the @ symbol feels redundant, we could also simplify and say that 5 + 24 = 29 directly; thus, the final answer remains the same.)

(1) 8 # 2: Since there are no common prime factors between 8 and 2, the prime factor counting is equal to 0.

(2) 6 # 6: Both numbers, 6 and 6, have the same prime factors namely 2 and 2. So, the prime factor counting is equal to 2.

Now, we apply the updated order of operations: P, E, F, M/D, A/S, and C.

Since there are parentheses in the given expression, the first step is to evaluate the prime factor counting operations inside the parentheses: 0 and 2. As we don't have any exponent signs, we can directly proceed to performing Multiplication and Division (M/D) which is the next operation:

0 * 2 = 0

So, our current expression becomes 0 + 6#6.

Since the + sign represents Addition (A), which comes after the Prime Factor Counting (F) in the updated order of operations, we must first evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operation 6#6:

6#6 = 2

Now, we can evaluate the Addition (A):

0 + 2 = 2

In this expression, there are parentheses, so we start with that.

(1) Parentheses:
We have parentheses that contain the expression 14 + 4. We evaluate this expression first:

14 + 4 = 18

So, the parentheses result in 18.

(2) Concatenation (C):
Now, we have an 'at' symbol (@) between 18 and 6. We'll perform the concatenation operation next:

18 @ 6 = 186

(3) Prime Factor Counting (F):
The expression also contains a '#' symbol between -2 and 3. Since we already know that the ordinality of concatenation is higher than prime factor counting, we will not perform prime factor counting in this case. But for the sake of clarity, let me give an example of its application: if a = 2 and b = 3, then a # b = 0.

(4) Multiplication and Division (M/D):
No multiplication or division operations exist in the expression, so we can skip this step.

(5) Addition and Subtraction (A/S):
We still don't have any addition or subtraction operations left to perform.

There are no exponents in the expression.

In this problem, only arithmetic operations (A/S and M/D) and prime factor counting (F) are involved. Since there are no parentheses, exponents, or concatenation in this expression, we can skip those steps.

The problem consists of addition (A) and prime factor counting (F) operations. According to the order of operations, we must first evaluate the prime factor counting operation, which is #. However, since there are no absolute values in the given numbers, we do not need to take the absolute value before performing prime factor counting as stated in the examples.

In the problem, we have the numbers 5 and 3, and we are performing prime factor counting and addition. The prime factorization of 5 is 5, and the prime factorization of 3 is 3. Comparing the prime factors, we find that we share none; thus, the result of the prime factor counting operation is zero.

Now that we have completed the prime factor counting operation, we can proceed to the addition operation. The numbers to be added are 5 and 3, so the result of the addition operation is 8.

Thus, the solution for the given problem (5 + 3 # 2), following the new order of operations in Mathematics, is:

1. Perform prime factor counting (F): 0
2. Perform addition (A): 5 (from the original expression) + 3 (from the original expression) = 8

3. Prime Factor Counting: None in this problem.
4. Multiplication and Division (left to right): We have @ which is concatenation, but it comes after addition and subtraction in the order of operations, so we need to handle addition first:

5 + 2 = 7 (addition)

Now we can do the concatenation:

7 @ 4 = 74

systemPrompt3_userPrompt2_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 8 # 2 + 6 # 6, we need to follow the updated order of operations: PEFMDASC.

First, let's perform prime factor counting (F):

The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2, and 2. Since 2 is a common prime factor between 8 and 2, the result of prime factor counting for 8 and 2 is 2.

The prime factors of 6 are 2, 3, and 3. Since there is no common prime factor between 6 and 2, the result of prime factor counting for 6 and 2 is 0.

Now, since concatenation (C) is performed last, we can skip it for now and move on to multiplication and division (M/D) since there is multiplication in the problem.

We need to evaluate the operations within the parentheses first (P), so we focus on 2 + 6:

2 + 6 = 8

Now, our problem is reduced to 8 # 8.

The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2, 2. Since these factors are repeated, the prime factor counting for 8#8 is equal to the number of repeated factors, which is 4.

So, we have 0 (from prime factor counting of 8 and 2) + 8 (from performing the addition within the parentheses) + 4 (from prime factor counting of 8#8).

The answer is 12."

systemPrompt3_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify and handle any parentheses (P). In this problem, there are none.
2. Perform any prime factor counting (F). In this problem, we have # (prime factor counting) between + and 3. Since the order of operations is PEFMDASC, prime factor counting comes before addition and numbers arise, we need to check prime factors common to 3 and 2. The prime factors of 3 are 3, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since there is only one common prime factor 2, the prime factor counting (#) operation results in 1.
3. Perform any multiplication and division (M/D) from left to right. In this problem, we don't have any multiplication or division.
4. Perform any addition and subtraction (A/S) from left to right.
5. Perform concatenation (C) from left to right.

So, for the given problem, the operations should be performed as follows:

5 + 3 # 2

Since there are no parentheses (step 1), we proceed to step 2: prime factor counting (F). In this given case, we have the prime factor counting operation (#) between the + sign and the number 3. Perform the prime factor counting on the given numbers:

- Prime factors of 3: 3
- Prime factors of 2: 2
- No shared prime factors between 3 and 2. The result of prime factor counting (#) is 0.

Now, we move to step 4: performing any addition and subtraction (A/S) from left to right. In our given problem, there's only one addition (+) operation.

5 + 0

Now, the final answer is:

The answer is 5."

Step 1: Parentheses
There are no parentheses in this expression, so we move to the next operation.

Step 2: Exponents
There are no exponents, so we move to the next operation.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
We don't have enough information to perform prime factor counting since we don't have the absolute values of 5 and 2. So, we move to the next operation.

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
There is no multiplication or division in this expression, so we move to the next operation.

To find the number of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of the given numbers, we calculate the prime factor count for each pair using the '#' symbol (Prime Factor Counting).

First, let's find the prime factor count for 8 and 2:
- 8 = 2³ * 2
- 2 = 2

Since both numbers share the prime factor '2', the prime factor count for (8 # 2) is 1.

Next, let's find the prime factor count for 6 and 6:
- 6 = 2 * 3²

Both 6 and 6 share the prime factor '2', so the prime factor count for (6 # 6) is 1.

Step 2: Addition
Now, we can evaluate the addition part of the given expression according to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

Firstadd: 8 # 2 = 1
secondadd: 1 + 6 # 6

Since prime factor counting comes before addition, we need to find the prime factor count between 1 and 6 # 6 first:
Prime factorization of 6 # 6: 6 = 2 * 3², so the prime factors of 6 # 6 are '2' and '3'.
Therefore, the prime factor count for (1 + 6 # 6) = 1 (as there is no shared prime factor between 1 and the shared prime factor '3' in 6 # 6)

So, the value of the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 according to the given order of operations PEFMDASC is:

1. Parentheses: Solve the expression inside the parentheses first, i.e., 14 + 4 = 18
2. Exponents: None in this expression
3. Prime Factor Counting: Let's find shared prime factors between each pair, but for now, focus on the pairs that don't involve concatenation since it comes last.

a. Between 18 and 6, there are no common prime factors, so 18 # 6 = 0
b. Between 18 and 12, prime factors for 18 are 2, 2, 3, 3, and for 12, prime factors are 2, 2, and 3. Only the prime factor 2 is common, so 18 # 12 = 2.
c. Between 12 and -2, we cannot find common prime factors since one is negative, so 12 # -2 = 0
d. Between -2 and 3, there are no common prime factors, so -2 # 3 = 0.

Now, let's apply concatenation:

1. Concatenation: 6 @ (18 + 4) = 6 @ 22 = 622
