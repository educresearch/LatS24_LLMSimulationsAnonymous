The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Using the revised order of operations, PEFMDASC, we have:

1. Evaluate prime factor counting: 4 # 3 = 1 (since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 3 are 3, 1)
2. Evaluate addition: 1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: The answer is 2.

Explanation:

Using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we first evaluate the prime factor counting (F) between 4 and 3, which gives us 1. Then, we add 2 to the result, giving us a final answer of 2.

So, the calculation would be:
4 # 3 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 2

Therefore, the answer is 2.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's the step-by-step explanation for the problem 4 # 3 + 2 using the PEFMDASC order:

1. First, we need to calculate the prime factor counting operation between 4 and 3, which is 4 # 3 = 1 (since there is only one shared prime factor, which is 2).
2. Next, we need to add 2 to the result of the prime factor counting operation, which gives us 1 + 2 = 3.
3. Therefore, the final answer is 3.

The answer is 3.

llama-2-70b-chat,1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: The given problem is 5 + 2 @ 4.

According to the new order of operations, we need to evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses first, which is 2 @ 4.

2 @ 4 = 2 @ 4 = 8

Now, we add 5 and 8:
5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the revised order of operations: PEFMDASC.

First, we need to evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses: 2 @ 4 = 2 @ 4 = 8.

Next, we need to evaluate the exponents (none in this case).

Then, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting: 5 # 8 = 1 (since the prime factors of 5 are 5 and 1, and the prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 1, and there is only one shared prime factor, 1).

After that, we need to evaluate the multiplication and division (left to right): none in this case.

Then, we need to evaluate the addition and subtraction (left to right): 5 + 1 = 6.

Finally, we need to evaluate the concatenation (left to right): 6 @ 8 = 68.

The answer is 68.","GPT Response: The updated order of operations is PEFMDASC, which means that we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first, then the exponents, then the prime factor counting, then the multiplication and division (from left to right), then the addition and subtraction (from left to right), and finally the concatenation (from left to right).

In the given problem, 5 + 2 @ 4, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first, which is 2 @ 4.

2 @ 4 = 2 @ 4 (concatenation) = 024 = 24 (since the digits of 2 and 4 are concatenated)

Now, we need to add 5 to 24, which gives us:

5 + 24 = 29

Therefore, the final answer is 29.

As for the negative prompts, here are some examples of what to avoid:

* Do not assume traditional order of operations (PEMDAS) and write 6 @ 14 + 4 + 12 - 2 # 3 = 6 @ 14 + 4 + 12 - 6, which is incorrect.
* Do not skip steps and write 6 @ 14 + 4 + 12 - 2 # 3 = 108 + 12 - 6 = 114, which is incorrect.
* Do not use examples not directly related to the given operations and expressions, such as 6 @ 14 + 4 + 12 - 2 # 3 = 6 @ 14 + 4 + 12 - 2 * 3 = 6 @ 14 + 4 + 12 - 6 = 114, which is incorrect."
