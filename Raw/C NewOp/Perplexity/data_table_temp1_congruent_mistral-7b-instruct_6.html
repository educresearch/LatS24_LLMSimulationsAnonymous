Prime Factor Counting (F): Find the number of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of the numbers 4 and 3. Since prime factors for 4 are 2 and 2 and for 3 are 3. In this case, there is no shared prime factor, so the result is 0.<br>2. Concatenation (C): Perform the concatenation of the results from the previous step and the number 2.

      <td>GPT Response: Given the new order of operations PEFMDASC, the problem 5 + 3#2 follows the sequence as follows:<br><br>1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Find the prime factor count shared by |5| and |3|, and |5| and |2|.Since the prime factors of 5 are 5, and the prime factors of 3 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 2 are 2, we have one shared prime factor 2 for 5 and 3, and no shared prime factor for 5 and 2. Therefore, the prime factor count for 5 and 3 is 1, and the prime factor count for 5 and 2 is 0.<br><br>2. Addition (S): Perform the addition operation. Since we calculated 5 + 3#2 as the sum of 5 and 3 with the result of 3#2, which is 1 (since there's one shared prime factor between 5 and 3), the sum of 5 and 1 is 6.<br><br>3. Concatenation (C): Since there's no operation inside the parentheses or involving exponents, we do not need to consider Parentheses (P), Exponents (E), or Multiplication/Division (M). Thus, we can directly perform the concatenation operation between |6| and |0| since 0 is the result of 5 and 2 having no shared prime factors. Hence, the concatenation of digits results in 60.<br><br>Therefore, the solution to the problem 5 + 3#2 is 60.<br><br>The answer is 60.</td>

Prime Factor Counting (#): We have the symbol #, so we should evaluate its operation before any others. In this case, the prime factors of 3 and 2 are both 2, which means there is a shared prime factor, so: 3 # 2 = 1.<br>4. Multiplication (x) and Division (/): Since we don't have any multiplication or division here, we continue to the next operation.<br>5. Addition (+) and Subtraction (-): There's an addition sign (+) between the numbers, so we evaluate it before the last operation (concatenation).<br>6. Concatenation (C): In this problem, there's no concatenation sign, so we don't have to evaluate this operation.<br><br>Given the order of operations, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting first, then addition.
