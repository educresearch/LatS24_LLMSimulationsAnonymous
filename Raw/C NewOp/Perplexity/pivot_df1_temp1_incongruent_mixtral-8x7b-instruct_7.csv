mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we follow the new order of operations PEFMDASC.

First, there are no parentheses or exponents to evaluate, so we move on to prime factor counting. However, 2@4 is a concatenation operation, not prime factor counting, so we can skip prime factor counting in this case.

Next, we evaluate the concatenation operation 2@4, which gives us 24.

Now, we move on to addition, and add 5 to the result of the concatenation operation:

5 + 24 = 29

Therefore, the answer is 29."

According to this order, we should first perform concatenation (C), then addition and subtraction (A/S), and finally prime factor counting (F).

First, let's evaluate the expression in the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18.

Next, we have the expression: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3.

We perform concatenation (C) first:
6 @ 18 = 618.

Now, we have the expression: 618 + 12 - 2#3.

We perform addition and subtraction (A/S) next:
618 + 12 = 630.

So, we have the expression: 630 - 2#3.

We perform prime factor counting (F) last:
The prime factors of 2 are 2, and there are no prime factors in common with 3.
So, 2#3 = 0.

1. First, we need to perform the concatenation operation (C) because it comes before addition (A) in the order of operations. So, let's calculate 2@4:

2@4 = 24 (since the concatenation operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together)

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: Step 1: Calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) for the first pair of numbers, 8 and 2.
8 # 2 = 2 (since the prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2, 2 and the prime factors of 2 are 2, so there is 1 shared prime factor 2).

Step 2: Perform the Addition (+) operation inside the first pair of numbers.
2 + 6 = 8

Step 3: Calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) for the second pair of numbers, 8 and 6.
8 # 6 = 0 (since the prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2, 2 and the prime factors of 6 are 2, 3, so there are no shared prime factors).

Step 4: Perform the Addition (+) operation inside the second pair of numbers.
8 + 0 = 8

Step 5: Since the order of operations states that addition comes before concatenation, we need to wait until this point to concatenate the results from steps 1 and 3.
Abbreviate this result as $ (to avoid confusion with the prime factor counting operation at the beginning).
8 @ $ = 88 @ $ = 88 (since $|$ is 0).

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Step 1: Follow the order of operations and evaluate what is inside the parentheses first.
14 + 4 = 18

Step 2: Now we have the expression 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3.
Next, we need to perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation. However, we cannot do this yet, as we need to follow the order of operations. Continue with the rest of the operations up to this point.

Step 3: Perform Concatenation (C) operation.
6 @ 18 = 618
So the expression becomes 618 + 12 - 2 # 3.

Step 4: Perform Addition and Subtraction (A/S) operation from left to right.
618 + 12 = 630
The expression now becomes 630 - 2 # 3.

Step 5: Perform Prime Factor Counting (F) operation.

Given expression: 5 + 3 # 2

Step 1: Perform the prime factor counting operation (F)
Since there is no need to count the prime factors of 3 (it has 1 unique prime factor) before doing the addition operation, we can directly proceed to perform prime factor counting operation (F) for 2.

So, the prime factor of 2 is 2 itself.

Step 2: Perform the addition operation (A)
Now, perform the addition operation (A) on the results from Step 1 (F) and the preceding number 3.

5 + 1 = 6

Step 3: Perform the Concatenation operation (if any) (C)
As no Concatenation operation is given in the expression after the above addition, we don't need to proceed further for Concatenation.

The answer is 6."
