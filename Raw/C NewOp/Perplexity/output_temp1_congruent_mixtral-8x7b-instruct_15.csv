                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

First, let's find the prime factors of the numbers involved:

8 = 2^3
2 = 2^1

Prime factors of 8 = {2}
Prime factors of 2 = {2}
 shared prime factors = {2}

8 # 2 = 1 (there is only 1 shared prime factor, 2)

Similarly,

6 = 2 * 3
6 = 2 * 3
 shared prime factors = {2, 3}

6 # 6 = 2 (there are 2 shared prime factors, 2 and 3)

Now, apply the updated order of operations to the expression:

Now we have 5 + 0, which is just 5 (since the addition of 0 to any number doesn't change the number). So,

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses, if any. In this case, there are no parentheses, so we move to the next step.
2. Perform Prime Factor Counting. However, there are no variables with multiplication or division, so we skip this step.
3. Perform Multiplication and Division from left to right. But there are no multiplication or division operations in this expression.
4. Now, perform the Concatenation operation. The concatenation of 2 and 4 is 24, since we drop the leading digits if they are zeros. So, 2 @ 4 = 24.
5. Finally, perform Addition from left to right. We have the number 5 and the result of the concatenation operation. Adding these numbers together, we get 5 + 24 = 29.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: Let's break down the expression using the revised order of operations PEFMDASC and take care to apply each new operation carefully.

The expression is: 6@(14+4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses
Within the parentheses, we first perform the addition:
14 + 4 = 18

The expression now becomes: 6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: New Operation - Concatenation (C)
Calculate the concatenation operation (C):
6 @ 18 = 618 (digits of |6| and |18| joined together)

The expression now becomes: 618 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction (left to right). Perform these operations from left to right.

First, Do addition: 618 + 12 = 630

Then, Do subtraction: 630 - 2 = 628

The expression now becomes: 628 # 3

Step 4: New Operation - Prime Factor Counting (F)

Calculate the prime factorization counting operation (F):
- 628 has prime factors 2 and 157, and has only 1 shared prime factor 2 with |3|
- 3 has a prime factor of 3 only.

Then, 628 # 3 = 1 (since there is only 1 shared prime factor between 628 and 3)

So, the answer is:

The answer is 1."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
