We have 4, and we want to subtract 3 from it.<br><br>The number line subtraction shows: 4 - 3 = 1<br><br>Step 3: Concatenation (C)<br>Since concatenation is the last operation to be performed, we concatenate the result of the previous step (1) with the number 3.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

Addition and Subtraction (A/S): This is the first arithmetic operation in our expression, so we evaluate it. Here, we perform addition before concatenation since 'A' comes before 'C' in the order of operations.<br><br>So, the solution would be: 5 + 2 = 7 and since we encountered prime factor counting (F) before concatenation, the answer would be 0 (as per the key examples).<br><br>So, the incorrect problem statement 5 + 2 @ 4 has an answer of 0.

In this example, we provided the step-by-step solution for demonstration purposes and stressing the importance of using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC) when performing new operations like concatenation.
