mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC). According to this order, we need to perform prime factor counting (F) before addition (A). 

First, let's find the prime factors of 4 and 3. The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factor of 3 is 3. Since 2 is a shared prime factor of both 4 and 3, we have:

4 # 3 = 2

Next, we need to add 2 to the result. Therefore, we have:

4 # 3 + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4

So, the answer is 4.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we must follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. First, calculate the prime factor counting (F) operation: 4 # 3 = 1, since the only shared prime factor of 4 and 3 is 1 (note that 4 has prime factors 2 and 2, while 3 has prime factors 3, so there is no shared prime factor).
2. Next, do the addition (A) operation: 1 + 2 = 3.
3. The problem requires no exponents (E), multiplication/division (M/D), or parentheses (P), and concatenation (C) is done last. However, there are no remaining numbers to be concatenated.

Therefore,
The answer is 3.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we must follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC). According to this order, we perform Prime Factor Counting (F) before Addition (A).

1. First, calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) for 4 # 3.
 prime factors of 4 is 2
 prime factors of 3 is 3
 Since there are no shared prime factors, 4 # 3 = 0.

2. Next, perform the Addition (A) after completing Prime Factor Counting (F): 0 + 2

The answer is 0 + 2, which is 2.","GPT Response: Let's tackle the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the revised order of operations PEFMDASC.

1. First, let's identify any Parentheses (P). There are none, so we proceed to the next step.
2. Next, check for Exponents (E). Again, there are none, so we move on to the next step.
3. Now, let's perform Prime Factor Counting (F). We calculate the unique prime factors of the absolute values of the numbers 4 and 3:
   - Prime factors of 4: 2
   - Prime factors of 3: 3
   Since there are no shared prime factors, the result of 4 # 3 is 0.
4. Next in line are Multiplication and Division (M/D), and Addition and Subtraction (A/S) from left to right, but none appear in the expression, so we skip this step.
5. Finally, we perform Concatenation (C) from left to right. However, since there are no concatenation operations left, we can proceed directly to this step:
   - We have 0 from our prime factor counting result, so the expression becomes 0 + 2.
6. Lastly, evaluate Addition (A). We add 0 and 2 to get the final answer.

The answer is 2."

First, let's find the prime factors of the numbers 2 and 3. The prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3, we have

3 # 2 = 0

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: For the expression 5 + 3#2, we need to follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC). According to this order, we should perform prime factor counting (F) before addition (A).

First, calculate 3#2:

3 # 2 = the number of unique prime factors shared by 3 and 2. Since 3 has only one prime factor (3), and 2 is a prime number itself, there is no shared prime factor between 3 and 2. Therefore, 3 # 2 = 0.

5 + 0 = 5

So, the solution to the expression 5 + 3#2 is simply 5.

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: First, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation. The prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, we have:

Given expression: 5 + 3#2

First, identify the operation with the highest precedence in PEFMDASC. In this case, it's the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation.

Step 1: Calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation: 3 # 2

The prime factors of 3 are 3, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. There are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, so 3 # 2 = 0.

1. Since there are no parentheses or exponents in the expression, we proceed to the next operation in the order.
2. There are no prime factor counting (F), multiplication (M), or division (D) operations in the expression, so we continue to the next operation.
3. We encounter a concatenation (C) operation, 2 @ 4. So, we concatenate the digits of 2 and 4.
4. This gives us 2 @ 4 = 24. Now, our expression looks like this: 5 + 24
