mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we must follow the new order of operations, PEFMDASC.

First, we perform the prime factor counting operation (F) on 4 and 3:

4 # 3 = 0

This is because the only prime factor of 4 is 2, and 3 has no prime factors in common with it.

Next, we perform addition (A) on the result of the prime factor counting operation and the number 2:

0 + 2 = 2

So, the answer is:

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we must follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), which includes the new mathematical operations Concatenation (C) and Prime Factor Counting (F).

Given expression: 4 # 3 + 2

First, we perform Prime Factor Counting (F):
4 # 3 = 2 (since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and of 3 are 3, and they share no common prime factors, the result is 0, but since we are counting unique prime factors, it is 1)

So, the expression becomes: 2 + 2

Next, we perform Addition (A):
2 + 2 = 4

Therefore, the answer is:
The answer is 4.","GPT Response: For the expression 4 # 3 + 2, we need to follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, which means we evaluate prime factor counting (F) before addition (A/S). First, let's find the prime factors of 4 and 3:

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since they do not have any common prime factors, the prime factor counting (F) of 4 and 3 is 0.

Now that we have evaluated the prime factor counting, we can proceed with the addition:

0 + 2 = 2

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Step 1: Perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation.
First, find the prime factors of the absolute values of the numbers 4 and 3. The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since there are no shared prime factors, the result of 4 # 3 is 0.

Step 2: Perform Addition (A) operation.
Now, add the result from Step 1 to the number 2: 0 + 2 = 2.

5 + 0 = 5

So,

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to perform prime factor counting (F) before addition (A). 

First, calculate the prime factor counting (F) of 3 and 2:

3 # 2 = 0 (since the prime factors of 3 are 3 and of 2 are 2, and there are no common prime factors)

Then, perform addition (A):

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Following the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to do prime factorization before concatenation. However, in this case, there are no operations other than concatenation that need to be done before it. So, we can proceed with the concatenation operation first:

5 + 2 @ 4
= 5 + 24
= 29

Therefore, the answer is 29.","GPT Response: For the expression 5 + 2 @ 4, we need to follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), which means we should perform concatenation after addition. So, we first evaluate 5 + 2, which is 7, and then concatenate it with 4.

Therefore, 5 + 2 @ 4 = 7 @ 4 = 74.

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: First, we need to evaluate the concatenation operation since it comes before addition in the order of operations (PEFMDASC). The concatenation of 2 and 4 is 24.

So, the expression 5 + 2 @ 4 becomes 5 + 24.

Next, we perform addition.

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. Evaluate the expression within the parentheses: there are no parentheses, so move to the next operation.
2. Evaluate exponents: there are no exponents, so move to the next operation.
3. Evaluate prime factor counting (F): in this case, it is not applicable since we don't have factors to count yet.
4. Evaluate multiplication and division (from left to right): there are no multiplication or division operations, so move to the next operation.
5. Evaluate addition and subtraction (from left to right): 
   a. Perform the addition: 5 + 2 = 7
6. Evaluate concatenation (C): 
   a. Since there is no other number left to concatenate with 7, there is no need to perform the concatenation step.

The answer is 7."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: Let's break down the problem step by step following the new order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. Parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18
2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this problem.
3. Prime Factor counting: None so far.
4. Multiplication and Division: None so far.
5. Addition and Subtraction: None from the original expression, but we will perform the subtraction from the last step: 12 - 2 = 10

Now let's continue with the remaining operations:

6. Concatenation:
	* 6 @ 18 = 618
7. Prime Factor counting:
	* 618 # 3 = 0 (no shared prime factors)

So, after applying the new order of operations, our result is 0 from the prime factor counting operation.

The answer is 0.","GPT Response: Let's go through the problem step by step following the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

6 @ (14 + 4) = 6 @ 18 = 618 (since concatenation is after addition)

618 + 12 - 2 = 618 + 10 = 628 (since addition is before subtraction)

628 # 3 = 0 (since there are no shared prime factors)

The answer is 0.","GPT Response: First, we follow the order of operations (PEFMDASC) and start with parentheses:

6@(14 + 4) = 6 @ 18 = 618

Next, we do the subtraction:

12 - 2 = 10

Now, we have two results: 618 and 10. We follow the order of operations again, and perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation:

618 # 10 = 0, because 618 and 10 do not have any common prime factors.

The answer is 0.","GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step, following the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. First, calculate the expression inside the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18.
2. Now, concatenate 6 and 18: 6 @ 18 = 618.
3. Perform the subtraction: 12 - 2 = 10.
4. Perform the prime factor counting operation: 3 # 10. Prime factors of 3 are 3 and prime factors of 10 are 2 and 5. Since there are no shared prime factors, 3 # 10 = 0.
5. Finally, add the results obtained in steps 2 and 4: 618 + 0 = 618.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations, we first need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation before the addition.

8 # 2 = 2 (since the only prime factor of both 8 and 2 is 2)

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC). According to this order, we need to perform Prime Factor Counting (F) before Addition or Subtraction (A/S).

So, first, let's calculate 8 # 2:

Prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2.
Prime factors of 2 are 2.
Since 2 is a shared prime factor, 8 # 2 = 1.

Next, let's calculate 6 # 6:

Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
Shared prime factors are 2 and 3. Hence, 6 # 6 = 2.

Finally, we can perform addition:

The answer is 1 + 2.

So, the answer is 3.","GPT Response: For the expression 8#2 + 6#6, we need to follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC). According to this order, Prime Factor Counting (F) should be performed before Addition (A).

First, let's calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) for both 8 and 2:

The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. There is one shared prime factor (2), so 8#2 equals 1.

Next, let's calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) for both 6 and 6:

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. There are two shared prime factors (2 and 3), so 6#6 equals 2.

Now, we can apply Addition (A) to these results:

1 (from 8#2) + 2 (from 6#6) = 3

Therefore, the answer is 3.","GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Calculate the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of the numbers.
   - For 8, the prime factors are 2 * 2 * 2, so there are 3 prime factors.
   - For 2, the prime factors are 2, so there is 1 prime factor.
   - Since they share only 1 prime factor (which is 2), we have 8 # 2 = 1.

2. Prime Factor Counting (F): Calculate the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of the numbers.
   - For 6, the prime factors are 2 * 3, so there are 2 prime factors.
   - For 6, the prime factors are 2 * 3, so there are 2 prime factors.
   - They share 2 prime factors (which are 2 and 3), we have 6 # 6 = 2.

3. Addition (A): Now that we have evaluated both prime factor counting expressions, we can add them.
