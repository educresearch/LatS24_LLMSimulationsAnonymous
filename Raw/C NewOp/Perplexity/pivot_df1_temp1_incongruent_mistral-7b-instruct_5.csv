mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first identify the operations that need to be performed: addition and concatenation.

According to the new order of operations:

1. Parentheses (none in this expression)
2. Exponents (none in this expression)
3. Prime Factor Counting (none in this expression)
4. Multiplication and Division (none in this expression)
5. Addition and Subtraction (L to R)
6. Concatenation (L to R)

Since there is an addition operation and a concatenation operation, we'll perform the addition first, as per the new order of operations:

Addition: 5 + 2@4

Since the concatenation operation (@) needs to be performed before addition as per the new order of operations, we need to evaluate the concatenation first:

Concatenation: 2@4 = 24

Now, we can perform the addition:

Addition: 5 + 24 = 29

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 29."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression with the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first focus on the prime factor counting (F) operation:

1. Find the prime factors of each number and compute the count of the unique shared prime factors:
   a. 8 has prime factors 2 and 2, so 2 shares are counted.
   b. 2 has prime factor 2 only, so 1 share is counted.
   c. 6 has prime factors 2 and 3, so 1 share is counted for each prime factor.

Since the prime factor counting operation # is performed before addition, we first compute the prime factor counts: 8 # 2 = 1 and 2 # 6 = 1.

Now, we move on to the addition (S) operation, which is performed from left to right:

2. Add the results of the prime factor counting operation: 1 + 1 = 2

2. Exponents:
    No exponents are present in the expression.

3. Prime Factor Counting:

    June and eighteen do not have any shared prime factors, so 6 # 18 = 0.

4. Multiplication and Division (from left to right):
    We don't have any multiplication or division operations in this problem.

5. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right):
    First, we need to evaluate concatenation, as it comes before addition and subtraction.

Here's a breakdown of the given expression without the concatenation operation:

6 # (14+4) + 12 - 2

We've already calculated 6 # (14+4) = 6 # 18 = 0 in the prime factor counting step.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to identify which operations need to be performed first.

Given expression is 5 + 3 # 2.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): We need to find the unique prime factors shared by |5| and |3|, and |5| and |2|.
 Prime factors of 5: 5
 Prime factors of 3: 2, 3
 Prime factors of 2: 2

Since there is no shared prime factor, the result of prime factor counting operation is 0.

Therefore, we need to evaluate addition operation before prime factor counting.

2. Addition (A): We need to add 5 and 3.
 The answer is 8.

But since there is a Concatenation (C) operation next in the order of operations, we need to apply it to the result 8.

3. Concatenation (C): We need to concatenate the digits of the result we obtained in the previous step, i.e., 8.

1. Concatenation (C): Since neither of the given numbers has an @ symbol between them, we move on to the next operation.
2. Prime factor counting (F): prime factor counting is not applicable as no absolute values are present in the problem, and we cannot perform prime factor counting on bases or variables.
3. Parentheses (P): In our problem, there are no parentheses, so we move on to the next operation.
4. Exponents (E): There are no exponents in the problem, so we move on to the next operation.
5. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There is no multiplication or division sign in the problem, so we move on to the next operation.
6. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We have two numbers, 5 and 2@4. According to the order of operations, we need to evaluate the @ operation before addition. So the problem becomes 5 + 2@4 => 5 + 2@4 => 5 + 26.

First, we'll perform prime factor counting for each term:

1. 8 # 2
   Prime factors of 8: 2, 2, 2
   Prime factors of 2: 2
   They don't have any shared prime factors, so the result is 0.

2. 0 + 6 # 6
   We already computed 6 # 6 in a previous example, which resulted in 1 (see example (a) above).

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem with the new mathematics operations and the revised order of operations, we need to follow these steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): First, we calculate the prime factor counting of the given numbers 3 and 4.
   - Prime factors of 3: 3
   - Prime factors of 4: 2
2. Since there is no shared prime factor between the given numbers 3 and 4, the prime factor counting operation results in 0.

Based on the newly updated order of operations, we perform operations from the top to the bottom:

P (there is no parenthesis in the given expression),
E (there is no exponent in the given expression),
F (we have already calculated the prime factor counting),
M/D: Since there is no division and multiplication in the given expression, this step is skipped.
A/S: Addition is the only remaining operation. So, we perform the addition operation after concatenation.

Therefore, the given expression 4#3 + 2 evaluates to:

1. Concatenation (C): First, we perform the concatenation of the prime factor counts of the given numbers 3 and 4, which is 0. So, we get 02 for the concatenation.
2. Addition (A/S): Adding the digit 2 for number 3 and the digit 4 for number 4, we get 6.

2. Exponents: None in this problem.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): In this problem, we need to perform prime factor counting on numbers 3 and 2. The prime factors of number 3 are 3, and the prime factors of number 2 are 2. Since there is only one shared prime factor, the prime factor count is 1.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There is no multiplication or division operation in this problem.

2. Exponents: There are no exponents in the expression. So we move on to the next step.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): Since there are no concatenation or multiplication/division symbols in the expression, we can skip prime factor counting for now.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): In the expression, we have the digits 2 and 4 combined with the ""at"" symbol, which represents concatenation. However, the symbol preceding the concatenation isn't a multiplication or division symbol. Since concatenation takes precedence over addition and subtraction (as mentioned in the examples), we need to handle the concatenation before dealing with the addition. 
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): After handling the concatenation, we can now perform the addition.

Following these steps, the solution would be:

5 + 2@4

First, we perform the concatenation operation:

5 + 12 (since 2@4 = 2 @ 4 = 21, and 12 + 2 = 14, we can count the number of digits in the concatenated result to determine how many times we need to add 1 to get the answer. In this case, since 21 has two digits, we need to add 1 twice.)

5 + 12 = 17

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to identify which operations need to be performed first. The prime factor counting (#) symbol comes before both addition (+) and concatenation (@), so we will begin by calculating prime factor counts.

Given expressions: 8 # 2 and 6 # 6

First, we calculate prime factor counts for each number:

8 # 2 = |8| # |2| = 2 # 2 = 1 (since both 2 and 2 have only one prime factor- 2, so they have one shared prime factor)

6 # 6 = |6| # |6| = 3 # 3 = 2 (since both 6 and 6 have two prime factors - 2 and 3, so they have 2 shared prime factors)

Next, we'll calculate the addition:

1 (from 8 # 2) + 2 (from 6 # 6) = 3

So, the result of calculating all the expressions in the given order of operations is the prime factor count 3.

Therefore, the final answer is:
The answer is 3.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem using the new mathematical operations and the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow these steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting: 
   First, we perform the prime factor counting (#) operation on the given numbers 4 and 3.
   Since 4 has prime factors 2, 2, and 2, and 3 has prime factors 3 and 1, we have:
   4 # 3 = 0.

2. Addition:
   Now, we do the addition (A/S) operation in the remaining problem, 0 + 2.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to deal with the parentheses:

1. Parentheses: (14 + 4) = 18

Now, we apply the new operations in the correct order:

2. Concatenation: 6 @ 18 = 618
3. Addition and Subtraction (left to right): 618 + 12 = 629
4. Prime Factor Counting: The prime factors of |629| are 3, 7, and 23 (since 629 = 3^2 * 7 * 23). So, we count the occurrences of these prime factors in numbers 1 and 629.
   - Prime factor count between 1 and 629: 0, since there are no shared prime factors.
5. Multiplication and Division (left to right): There is no multiplication or division sign present in the expression, so we move on to the last step.

The answer is 618. However, the problem has an error since the given expression (6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3) does not follow the correct order of operations. Applying the new operations to the incorrect expression results in an incorrect answer. The provided expression is ill-formed and should be corrected before attempting to find the solution."

Since the prime factor 2 is common to both numbers, we have a prime factor count of 1 (# operation results in 0 when there are no shared prime factors).

Next, we follow the order of operations, which is PEFMDASC. Since there are no parentheses or exponents, we proceed to multiplication and division (M/D). However, there are no multiplication or division operations in this equation. So we move on to addition and subtraction (A/S), which is the next operation in the order:

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 2@4 using the PEFMDASC order, follow these steps:

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in the expression, so we move on to the next operation.

2. Exponents: There are no exponents in the expression, so we move on to the next operation.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We cannot perform prime factor counting on numbers without calculating their absolute values, so we cannot apply it yet.

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): Concatenation (@) is considered a separate operation and should be performed before multiplication and division. Therefore, we cannot apply M/D yet.

5. Concatenation (C): In this expression, there is no concatenation operation. We'll focus on 2@4 instead. Since we've determined that concatenation cannot be applied before it, we'll move on to the next operation.

6. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Since there is an addition sign (+) before the @ symbol, we should perform the addition operation first.

7. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Our updated expression is now: 5 + 2@4 => 5 + 9

8. Prime Factor Counting (F): Since we've calculated the absolute values necessary for prime factor counting, we can now apply it. 

9. Prime Factor Counting (F): The prime factor counting for 5 and 9 are 1 and 3 respectively. Since there are no shared prime factors, the prime factor counting operation yields 0.

     * Shared prime factors: None.
     * Prime factor counting: 0.
   b. For 6 # 6:
     * Absolute values of 6 and 6 are 6 and 6 respectively.
     * Shared prime factors: 2 and 2.
     * Prime factor counting: 2.

2. Exponents: There are no exponents in the expression, so we move on to the next operation.

3. Prime Factor Counting (again): Since we've already calculated the prime factor counting for the individual # operations, we cannot apply this operation to the sum of the results directly. Instead, we calculate the prime factor counting of the prime factor counting results:
   * The prime factor counting of 0 and 2 is 2.
   * The prime factor counting of 0 and 2 is 2.
   * Thus, prime factor counting of 0 + 6 # 6 = 2 + 2 = 4.

4. Multiplication and Division (MD): There are no multiplications or divisions in this expression, so we move on to the next operation.

5. Addition and Subtraction (AS): The expression only consists of addition, so we evaluate it in the given order:
   * First, we solve addition within the same # sign (i.e., +):
     * Add 6 to the result of 6 # 6 (which was calculated earlier to be 2):
       6 + 2 = 8
    * So far, our intermediate result is 0 (since we did not consider the prime factor counting for the initial 8 # 2) and 8.
   * Next, we add the results of the individual # operations:
     * 0 + 8 = 8

6. Concatenation (C): At last, we perform the concatenation operation as the very last step:
   * We concatenate 8 (the final result after performing addition) and 4 (the prime factor counting result).
