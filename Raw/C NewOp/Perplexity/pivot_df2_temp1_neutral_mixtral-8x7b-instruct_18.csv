mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we follow the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC). According to this order, we perform prime factor counting (F) before addition (A).

First, let's find the prime factors of 4 and 3:

4 = 2^2
3 = 3 (prime number, so only one unique prime factor)

They share no prime factors, so 4 # 3 = 0.

Next, we perform addition (A):

0 (from previous step) + 2 = 2

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Calculate the prime factor counting of 4 and 3, i.e., 4 # 3.
   The prime factors of 4 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. There are no shared prime factors, so the result is 0.

2. Addition (A): Perform the addition after Prime Factor Counting (F), i.e., 0 + 2.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow these steps:

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in this problem, so we move on to the next operation.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this problem, so we move on to the next operation.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We calculate the prime factors of 2 @ 4. The number 2 @ 4 = 24, and its prime factors are 2 and 3 (with no shared prime factors between the absolute values of 2 and 4). Therefore, 2 # 4 = 0.
4. Multiplication and Division (M and D): There are no multiplication or division operations in this problem.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A and S): There is an addition operation, but we cannot proceed until we resolve 2 # 4, which is 0.
6. Concatenation (C): Since 2 # 4 = 0, we can now perform the concatenation of 5 and the result of 2 @ 4:
   5 + (2 @ 4) = 5 + 24 = 29

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to evaluate addition before concatenation.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), which includes parentheses, exponents, prime factor counting, multiplication and division (left to right), addition and subtraction (left to right), and concatenation (left to right).

In this problem, there are no parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, or subtraction, so we start with prime factor counting. The prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since they have no shared prime factors, 3 # 2 = 0.

Now we have:

5 + 0

We then perform addition:

5 + 0 = 5

Therefore, the answer is 5.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation:

3 # 2 = 0 (since the only prime factor of 3 is 3 and the only prime factor of 2 is 2, and they don't share any common prime factors, the result is 0).

Now, we are left with:

5 + 0

The expression given is: 5 + 3 # 2

First, we perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation as it appears in the order of operations.

To perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation, we calculate the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 3 and 2:

Prime factors of 3: 3
Prime factors of 2: 2

Since there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2 (0 shared prime factors), we have:

3 # 2 = 0

Now, substitute the value 0 for the prime factor counting operation in the original expression:

5 + 0

Lastly, perform the Addition (A) operation, as it is the first operation in the remaining sequence:

The answer is 630.","GPT Response: Let's begin by breaking down the expression and following the PEFMDASC order of operations.

The expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses
14 + 4 = 18

So, the expression now becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents (there are no exponents in this expression)

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Prime factors of 18 are 2 and 3. Prime factors of 2 are 2. Therefore, 2 and 3 are shared prime factors, so:
2 # 3 = 1

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (there are no multiplication or division in this expression)

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction
First, perform concatenation:
6 @ 18 = 618
Then, do addition and subtraction from left to right:
618 + 12 - 1 = 630 - 1 = 629

Therefore,

The answer is 4.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to first perform the prime factor counting (F) operation, then addition (A).

8 # 2 = 2 (since 8 has one unique prime factor 2 and 2 has one unique prime factor 2, so the shared prime factor is 2, and 2#2=1+1=2)

6 # 6 = 1 (since 6 has two unique prime factors - 2 and 3, and 6 has two unique prime factors - 2 and 3, so they don't share any prime factor, and 6#6=0+0=0, but we take absolute values, so 0 becomes 1)
