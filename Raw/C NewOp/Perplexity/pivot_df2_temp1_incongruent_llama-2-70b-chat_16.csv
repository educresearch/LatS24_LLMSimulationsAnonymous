llama-2-70b-chat,1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: The answer is 1.

Explanation:

In the expression 4#3 + 2, we need to follow the updated order of operations:

1. (P) Parentheses: None
2. (E) Exponents: None
3. (F) Prime Factor counting: 4 # 3 = 1 (since the prime factor of 4 is 4 and the prime factor of 3 is 3, and they share no common prime factors)
4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R): None
5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R): 4 # 3 = 1 + 2 = 3
6. (C) Concatenation (L to R): None

Therefore, the final answer is 3.","GPT Response: Using the revised order of operations, PEFMDASC, we evaluate the expression 4#3 + 2 as follows:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): 4#3 = 4#(2, 1) = 1 (since there is only 1 shared prime factor between 4 and 3, which is 2)
2. Addition (A/S): 4#3 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) before the addition (A/S).

4 # 3 = 1 (since the shared prime factor between 4 and 3 is 1)

So, the equation becomes:

1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's the step-by-step explanation for 4#3 + 2 using the PEFMDASC order:

1. Evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation: 4#3 = 4#(3) = 1 (since the only shared prime factor between 4 and 3 is 1)
2. Evaluate the addition (A) operation: 1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3.

llama-2-70b-chat,1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations: PEFMDASC.

1. Parentheses: Inside the parentheses we have 14+4 = 18
2. Exponents: None
3. Prime Factor Counting: None
4. Multiplication and Division (from left to right): 6 @ 18 = 108
