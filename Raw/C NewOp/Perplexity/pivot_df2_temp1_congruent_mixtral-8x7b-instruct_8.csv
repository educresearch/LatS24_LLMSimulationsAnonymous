mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations, we start by performing the prime factor counting operation (F) on 4 and 3. The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, 4 # 3 equals 0.

Now we are left with 0 + 2. We evaluate the addition operation (A) and get 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we must follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), which includes the new mathematical operations concatenation (C) and prime factor counting (F).

Given expression: 4 # 3 + 2

First, we perform prime factor counting (F) for 4 # 3:

Prime factors of 4: 2, 2
Prime factors of 3: 3

Since 4 and 3 have no shared prime factors, 4 # 3 = 0.

Now our expression becomes: 0 + 2

Next, we perform addition (A):

0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: First, according to the new order of operations, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) before addition (A). The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, the result of 4 # 3 is 0.

So, the expression becomes:

0 + 2

Now, we evaluate the addition:

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Let's solve the problem using the PEFMDASC order of operations, focusing on each step clearly:

1. Perform Prime Factor Counting (F): For the given expression 4 # 3 + 2, first determine the prime factor counting of 4 and 3. Prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, while prime factors of 3 are 3. Since there is no shared prime factor, the prime factor counting is 0.
2. Perform Addition (A): Now, move to the next step in the order, which is addition. Since we have completed the concatenation step C, we now perform the addition operation +: 0 + 2 = 2.

The answer is 2."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to perform the prime factor counting operation before the addition operation.

First, find the prime factors of the absolute values of 3 and 2:

3 has one prime factor, which is 3.
2 has one prime factor, which is 2.

Since the shared prime factor between 3 and 2 is 0 (no shared prime factors), we have:

3 # 2 = 0

Now, add 5 and the result:

5 + 0 = 5

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow these steps:

1. Perform the Prime Factor Counting operation (F) inside the parentheses:
5 + (3 # 2)
5 + 1 (since the only shared prime factor of 3 and 2 is 1)

2. Next, perform Addition (A):
5 + 1

The answer is 6.

So, the final answer is 6.","GPT Response: First, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation. The prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since they don't have any common prime factors, ","GPT Response: Step 1: Perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation.
In this case, we have 3 # 2. The prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. However, there are no shared prime factors between the two numbers, so the result of 3 # 2 is 0.

Step 2: Perform the Addition (A) operation.
Now we have 5 + 0 from Step 1. The result of the addition is 5.

The answer is 5."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we follow the new order of operations PEFMDASC.

First, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we move to prime factor counting. However, in this case, there are no numbers for which we can calculate the shared prime factors, so we can skip this step.

Next, we move to multiplication and division, but there are no multiplication or division operations in the problem.

Then, we come to addition and subtraction. Here, we have an addition operation with two numbers, 5 and 2 @ 4. We evaluate 2 @ 4 first, since concatenation comes after addition in the order of operations.

2 @ 4 = 24

So, we now have:

5 + 24

Adding these numbers, we get:

5 + 24 = 29

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations, we need to do the addition first, followed by the concatenation:

5 + 2 @ 4
= 5 + (2 @ 4)
= 5 + 24
= 29

Therefore, the answer is 29.

Explanation:
In the given expression, the addition operation (+) comes before the concatenation operation (@) in the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC). Therefore, we must perform the addition first, which gives us 5 + 2 = 7.

Next, we need to concatenate the result (7) with the number 4, following the concatenation operation (@) in the expression:

7 @ 4 = 74

Therefore, the final answer is the result of the addition (5 + 2), which is 7, combined with the concatenation operation, which results in 74, giving us a final answer of 29.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow these steps:

1. First, evaluate the expression inside the parentheses, which is just 5 + 2. The result is 7.
2. Next, we have the concatenation operation. However, there is no operation preceding it to apply the left-to-right rule for concatenation. Therefore, the result of this step is just the number 7 (since 7 has only one digit).

The answer is 7.","GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. First, we do the operation inside the parentheses, but in this case, there is only a number (5). So, we move on to the next step.
2. Since there are no exponents, multiplication, or division, we proceed to the next step.
3. Now we have a choice between prime factor counting (F) and addition (A). According to the revised order of operations, F comes before A. So we calculate the prime factor counting operation between 2 and 4.
4. Prime factors of 2 are 2 and prime factors of 4 are 2. Hence, we have one shared prime factor, 2. Therefore, 2 # 4 = 1.
5. Finally, we do the addition operation after concatenation (C). So, we add 5 and 1 (the result from the previous step).

4. Multiplication and Division: there are no multiplication or division operations in this problem
5. Addition and Subtraction: 12 - 2 = 10, so the problem now is 6@18 + 10 # 3

3. Then, perform the subtraction: 12 - 2 = 10

The answer is 0.","GPT Response: First, we need to follow the order of operations (PEFMDASC) and start with what is inside the parentheses:

14 + 4 = 18

Now, we have:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2   #  3

Next, we perform the Concatenation (C) since it has higher priority than Addition and Subtraction (A/S):

6 @ 18 = 618

6 # 6 = 2 (since the only prime factor of 6 is 2 and of 3 is none, but they share a common factor of 1)

Now, we have 1 + 2 = 3.

So, the answer is 3.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we must follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), which includes Prime Factor Counting (F) before Addition and Subtraction (A/S).

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: For the expression 8#2 + 6#6, we need to follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC. In this case, there are no Parentheses (P), Exponents (E), Multiplication or Division (M/D), nor Subtraction (S). The expression only consists of Prime Factor Counting (F) and Concatenation (C). Since Prime Factor Counting (F) comes before Concatenation (C) in the order of operations, we first compute the Prime Factor Counting for both 8#2 and 6#6.

8#2:
Prime factors of 8: 2, 2, 2
Prime factors of 2: 2
They share one prime factor 2, so 8#2 = 1.

6#6:
Prime factors of 6: 2, 3

8 # 2 = 1

Step 2: Perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation for the second pair of numbers, 6 and 6. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factor of 6 is 2, 3. Since they share two prime factors (2 and 3), their prime factor counting is 2.
