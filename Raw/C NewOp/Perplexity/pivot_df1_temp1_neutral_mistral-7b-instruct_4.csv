Constants: 8, 2, 6

8 # 2 = 0 (no shared prime factors)
8 # 6 = 1 (two numbers have one prime factor, 2)

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the newly defined order of operations PEFMDASC, we first focus on the prime factor counting operation (F):

1. Find the prime factors of each number 4 (2^2) and 3 (prime)
2. Count the unique shared prime factors between them, which is none since there are none. So, the count is 0.

So, 4 # 3 = 0.

Now, since addition is described in the expansion as ""A and S"" but combined as ""addition,"" we will perform the addition before the concatenation as per the new order of operations:

4 # 3 + 2 = 0 + 2 = 2.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to apply the operations inside the parentheses:

1. Parentheses:
   = 14 + 4
   = 18

2. Prime Factor Counting (#):
   We cannot perform prime factor counting until we have numbers to work with. So, we will come back to this step after step 3.

3. Concatenation (@):
   = 18 @ 6
   = 186

4. Addition/Subtraction (A/S):
   We cannot perform addition until we have numbers to work with. So, we will come back to this step after step 5.

5. Multiplication/Division (M/D):
   We don't have any multiplication or division signs in our expression.

Now we can go back to prime factor counting:

6. Prime Factor Counting (#):
   = 18 # 3
   = 1
   (The prime factors of 18 are 2, 2, 3, 3, ... but only 3 is a prime factor for both 18 and 3.)

Finally, we can perform addition/subtraction:

7. Addition/Subtraction (A/S):
   = 186 + 1
   = 187

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 187."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem using the new order of operations, we need to follow the expanded PEMDAS rule, which is now PEFMDASC. This means we first handle parentheses, exponents, prime factor counting, multiplication and division, addition and subtraction, and concatenation in that order.

Step 1: Prime factor counting (F)
Since there are no parentheses or exponents in our problem, we directly move to prime factor counting. In this problem, we have 5 and 3, and the common prime factors for both numbers are 1. So, 5 # 3 = 0 as per the given examples.

Step 2: Addition and Subtraction (A, S)
As per the updated order of operations, we need to perform all the addition and subtraction operations before concatenation. In our problem, we only have an addition operation (5 + 3). We can evaluate this addition since we have already performed the prime factor counting, resulting in 5 + 3 = 8.

Therefore, the answer is __. 
Answer: 8."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 5 + 2 @ 4, we need to follow the revised order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Parentheses: None in this expression.
2. Exponents: None in this expression.
3. Prime Factor counting (F): These are all single digits, so none need to be computed.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): Concatenation (@) is an operation that combines digits, but it's not exactly multiplication. Since there is no multiplication or division in the expression, this step is skipped.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Addition should be carried out before concatenation since the order of operations is A/S then C. In this case, we add 5 and 2, which equals 7.
6. Concatenation (C): Since we've already performed the addition before concatenation, there's no need to concatenate the numbers here.

Therefore, in the given problem 5 + 2 @ 4, the outcome of the addition part followed by concatenation is not valid since the current order of operations doesn't consider concatenation as a multiplication operation. Thus, the answer is undefined according to the updated rules.

Note: The mathematical community might need some more discussion and agreement on the placement of concatenation within the order of operations."

Let's start by calculating 8 # 2: The prime factorization of |8| is 2^3, and the prime factorization of |2| is 2. Since there is only one shared prime factor '2', the result of 8 # 2 is 1.

Next, we calculate 6 # 6: The prime factorization of |6| is 2^2 * 3, and the prime factorization of |6| is also 2^2 * 3. Since there are two shared prime factors '2' and '3', the result of 6 # 6 is 3.

So, the entire expression evaluates to 1 + 3 = 4.

The answer is 4."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: Based on the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, the solution to the problem 4 # 3 + 2 would be as follows:

First, we need to perform prime factor counting (F) for the given numbers 4 and 3. Prime factor counting of 4 is 2#2 and that of 3 is 2#3. Since they have no common prime factor, their prime factor counting product is 0.

Now, we move on to concatenation (C), but since there is no prime factor counting or concatenation to be performed before it, the result is just the numbers themselves, which are 4 and 3. Concatenation of 4 and 3 results in 43.

Finally, we perform addition (A). Adding two numbers, 2 and 43, gives 45 as the final answer.

1. Identify and handle the parentheses (if any). In this problem, there are no parentheses.
2. Calculate the exponents (if any). There are no exponents to evaluate in this problem.
3. Apply Prime Factor Counting (F). In this problem, # sign is used between 3 and 2, which represents the prime factor counting operation. According to the examples given:
   since prime factors of 3 are 3, and prime factors of 2 are 2. There is only one shared prime factor (2), i.e., (3 # 2) = 1.

The concatenation and Parentheses operations are not applicable, and the Exponent operation is not present in this problem.

So, in a nutshell, in this problem, we do Prime Factor Counting (operation F) and then Addition (operation A). In the given order of operations PEFMDASC, we follow the steps P (no parentheses), E (no exponents), F (Prime Factor Counting), M/D (no multiplication or division), A/S (Addition and Subtraction), and C (Concatenation; not used in this problem).

1. Parentheses: We don't have any parentheses in the expression, so we can skip this step.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents, so we can also skip this step.
3. Prime Factor Counting (#): Since we have the prime factor counting operation (#) between two numbers, we'll perform it first.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): We don't have any multiplication or division operations in our expression, so we can skip this step.

The first operation is Prime Factor Counting. Let's find the prime factors of the numbers 5, 3, and 2:
- Prime factors of 5: 5
- Prime factors of 3: 3
- Prime factors of 2: 2

Since there are no shared prime factors between the numbers, their prime factor count is 0.

Now, we follow the next operation in the order, which is Multiplication and Division. But, there is no multiplication or division in the given problem, so we move to the next operation, which is Addition and Subtraction.

Given problem: 5 + 3 # 2

Since we cannot perform Prime Factor Counting and Addition/Subtraction simultaneity, we need to follow the order strictly. In this case, since the # symbol precedes the + symbol, we need to perform Prime Factor Counting before Addition. Based on our calculations, Prime Factor Counting results in 0. So, we need to evaluate the # symbol (i.e., concatenation) before the + symbol:

3 # 2 = 3 (since prime factors of 3 are 3, and prime factors of 2 are 2, there are no common prime factors between 3 and 2, which results in prime factor count of 0, hence the result is 3)

So, the updated problem becomes: 5 + 3

5 + 3 = 8

1. Prime Factor Counting:
 Since there are no parentheses, exponents, or concatenation signs, we begin with prime factor counting. That is, we count the unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of each term.

 For the first term, 8, the prime factorization is 2³ × 2. The unique prime factors are {2, 2}. For the second term, 2, it's already prime, so the unique prime factor is {2}.

 Now, let's compare the prime factors: there is only 1 common prime factor, which is 2. So, 8 # 2 = 1.

 Using the same logic, we have 6 # 6 = 2.

2. Multiplication/Division: None present, so we move on to the next operation.

3. Addition/Subtraction:
 There are additions present: + and +. We perform addition from left to right.

Since there are no common prime factors in the prime factorization of 4 and 3, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 0.

Step 2: Addition and Subtraction (AS)
Since there's an addition operation (+) in the expression and it comes before concatenation (C) in the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), let's now perform the addition operation:

We have: 0 + 2 = 2
