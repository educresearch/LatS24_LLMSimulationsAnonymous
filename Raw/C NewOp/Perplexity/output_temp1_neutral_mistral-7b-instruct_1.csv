In this case, we have the prime factor counting (#) operation and the concatenation (@) operation. Since neither operation falls under parentheses, exponents, multiplication/division, or addition/subtraction, we will evaluate them last in the given order, which is concatenation followed by prime factor counting.

So, the solution would be:

1. Perform the prime factor counting operation (#) for the numbers 8 and 6:
   Since there is no shared prime factor between 8 (2³²) and 6 (2²⁴), their prime factor counting result is 0.

2. Now, perform the concatenation operation (@) for the results of the prime factor counting operation (which are 0 in this case).

systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression using the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to deal with the parentheses:

(14 + 4)
= 18 (adding the numbers inside the parentheses)

Now, we apply the operations according to the new order:

6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 (we evaluate what is inside the parentheses first)

For concatenation, we write the digits of the numbers next to each other:

6 @ 18 = 618

Next, we perform subtraction since it appears before concatenation in the order of operations:

618 + 12 - 2
= 620 - 2
= 618 (since we can't subtract 2 from 12 directly)

Now, we perform the prime factor counting operation:

618 # 3
No shared prime factors, so the result is 0.

Finally, we perform concatenation again to combine the result of the prime factor counting operation with the previous result:

0 @ 618
Results in a final answer of 0618.

The answer is 0618."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

Since prime factor counting comes before addition, we'll perform prime factor counting for both numbers individually, 8 and 2, and 6.

Prime factorization for 8: 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 2^4
Prime factorization for 2: 2
Prime factorization for 6: 2 × 2 × 3

Now we calculate the prime factor count (#) between them:

Since 2 is a common prime factor with a count of 2 in both numbers, the prime factor count between 8 and 2 is 2.
The prime factor count between 2 and 6 is 2, as well.

So, the prime factor count (#) for both expressions is 2. Now, we can evaluate the addition operation.

Since addition comes before concatenation, we first add the results of the prime factor counting:

2 + 2 = 4

Now, we perform the concatenation operation on the results of the addition:

4 @ 6 = 46

So, the solution is:

The answer is 46."

First, we perform prime factor counting (F) for the numbers involved in the problem, i.e., 5, 3, and 2. Here, we find that prime factors of 5 are 5, prime factors of 3 are 3, and prime factors of 2 are 2. Since there are no shared prime factors between 5 and 3, and between 3 and 2, prime factor counting (F) gives us 0 for all three combinations.

Then we evaluate multiplication and division (M/D). However, in this problem, there is no multiplication or division presented.

Next is addition and subtraction (A/S), which we evaluate from left to right. In this problem, we have 5 and 3, so we perform 5 + 3.

The final step is concatenation (C). Since there is no '@' operator present, we don't need to perform concatenation.

Therefore, the final answer, considering the given problem and the updated order of operations, is:

The answer is 8. (Explanation: Perform addition first, i.e., 5 + 3 = 8)"

systemPrompt4_userPrompt3_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), follow these steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting: 
   First, we need to find the prime factor count (#) between the absolute values of the numbers 4 and 3. In this case, prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and prime factors of 3 are 3. So, there is no shared prime factor. Therefore, the prime factor count equals 0.

2. Addition:
   Since we cannot perform concatenation on integers directly, let's move on to the addition operation. In our expression, we only have the number 2 to add to the result of the concatenation operation. So, the addition step comes after the concatenation operation in the PEFMDASC order.

In summary, the step-by-step solution in the correct order is:

1. Prime Factor Counting: 0
2. Concatenation: We cannot perform concatenation on integers directly; however, the expression doesn't have integers being concatenated, only the numbers 4 and 3 are given. To handle this expression, we need to apply the provision mentioned at the end of your instruction which states ""It's crucial to get this right for accurate calculations."" and ""Negative Prompts: Do Not generalize or use examples not directly related to the given operations and expressions."" Since the given expression does not include the new operation concatenation (C), the expression is incorrect in its current form and needs to be corrected by providing valid inputs for concatenation, such as numbers with lengths greater than 1 or strings. For now, let's assume that at some other point, a valid concatenation problem will be presented and we'll provide the correct solution using the PEFMDASC order.

The answer is: Once we have valid inputs for concatenation, we'll be able to provide the correct solution."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:

                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):

                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1.
