      <td>GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 2@4, we need to follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC). According to this order, concatenation (C) should be done after addition (A). So, we first evaluate 2@4 which gives us 24 (since the absolute values of 2 and 4 are 2 and 4, and the concatenation of 2 and 4 is 24).<br><br>Then, we perform the addition and get 5 + 24 = 29.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 29.</td>

Before performing the addition, we need to calculate the Concatenation (C). The expression 2@4 means to concatenate the digits of 2 and 4 and results in 24.<br>4.
