llama-2-70b-chat,1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: The answer is 1256.

Explanation:

1. First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18.
2. Then, we need to evaluate the concatenation: 6 @ 18 = 6 @ 18 = 1256.
3. Next, we need to evaluate the subtraction: 12 - 2 # 3 = 12 - 1 = 11.

Therefore, the final answer is 1256.","GPT Response: The answer is 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 = 108 + 12 - 2 = 118.

Explanation:

1. First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18.
2. Next, we need to evaluate the concatenation: 6 @ 18 = 6 @ 1800 = 10800.
3. Then, we need to evaluate the addition: 10800 + 12 = 10812.
4. Finally, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting: 2 # 3 = 0, since there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3.
5. Therefore, the final answer is 10812 - 0 = 10812.","GPT Response: The given problem is:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

We need to follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC) to solve this problem:

1. Parentheses: Evaluate what is inside the parentheses first:

14 + 4 = 18

So, the problem becomes:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Exponents (none in this case)
3. Prime Factor Counting:

2 # 3 = 0 (since there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3)

So, the problem becomes:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

4. Multiplication and Division (left to right):

6 @ 18 = 108

108 + 12 = 120

So, the problem becomes:

120 - 0

5. Addition and Subtraction (left to right):

120 - 0 = 120

6. Concatenation (left to right):

Since there is no concatenation operation in this problem, we can skip this step.

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 120.","GPT Response: Sure! Here's the step-by-step explanation for the given problem using the PEFMDASC order:

1. Concatenation (C): 6 @ (14 + 4) = 6 @ 18 = 6 @ 12 = 72
2. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): 72 + 12 = 84
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): 84 - 2 # 3 = 84 - 1 = 83

The answer is 83.

Here's a breakdown of each step:

1. In the first step, we perform the concatenation operation, joining the digits of 6 and 18 (the result of 14 + 4) together. This gives us 72.
2. In the second step, we add 12 to 72, giving us 84.
3. In the third step, we perform the prime factor counting operation, subtracting the count of shared prime factors between 84 and 2. Since 84 has 4 as a prime factor, and 2 has 2 as a prime factor, they share one prime factor, so we subtract 1 from 84, giving us 83.
