1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in the given expression, so we move on to the next rule.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents in the given expression, so we move on to the next rule.
3. Prime factor counting (F): We cannot perform prime factor counting directly in this problem, as it requires factors of numbers. So we move on to the next rule.
4. Multiplication and Division (M and D): There is no multiplication or division in the given expression, so we move on to the next rule.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A and S): Addition is present in the given expression, so we perform it before concatenation.
6. Concatenation (C): In the given expression, concatenation is applied to the numbers 2 and 4, so we perform it after addition.

Following the order of operations, we first evaluate the addition:

5 + 2 => 7

Now we perform concatenation:

7 @ 4

Given expression: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
    1. For the term 8 # 2: Prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2, and 2, and prime factors of 2 are 2. Since there are 2 instances of 2 as a prime factor for 8 and 1 instance for 2, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 2.
    2. For the term 6 # 6: Prime factors of 6 are 2, 2, and 3, and prime factors of 6 are the same. Thus, there are 3 instances of 2 as a prime factor for both 6 and 6, so the result of the prime factor counting operation is 3.

Now, we can perform the addition (A) operation since we have performed all the prime factor counting operations.

The expression after performing prime factor counting operation is 2 + 3.

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

Given expression: 5 + 3 # 2

First, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation (#). However, there are no parentheses present in this expression, so we proceed to # without any interruption:

5 # 3 # 2

Since prime factors for 5 and 3 are both 5, and prime factors for 2 are 2, the number of shared prime factors between 5, 3, and 2 is 1. So, the result of # operation is 1.

Now, since we have an addition operation (+) before # in the order of operations, we need to evaluate that as well before proceeding with concatenation:

5 + 1 (since the result of # operation is added to the first term before concatenation)

The sum of 5 and 1 is 6.

As we have only addition operation left, we can easily evaluate it:

6 (which is the result of the addition operation)

We are left with the concatenation operation (C), which we can now perform with the final result (6):

6 @ _

Unfortunately, we still have an empty spot for the second term to be concatenated. Since there's no given second term, we cannot provide an actual answer for this problem.

Therefore, the problem 5+3#2 is not solvable with the given information provided as we are missing the value of 2 in order to perform the concatenation operation. Try adding the missing information to find the final result."

systemPrompt3_userPrompt2_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem based on the new mathematical operations and updated order of operations, we need to follow the order of PEFMDASC:

1. Prime Factor Counting (#): First, we perform the prime factor counting for each number:
   a. For 8: Prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, so # of common prime factors is 2.
   b. For 2: It only has one prime factor, 2.

2. Concatenation (C): Since there is no addition sign and both operands are given, we perform the concatenation next:
   8 # 2 = 82

3. Multiplication and Division (MD): There is no multiplication or division symbol in the expression, so we move on to the next operation.

4. Addition and Subtraction (AS): Our expression has two addition sign (+) and multiple operands (8, 2, and 6), so we need to follow the rules of adding multiple digits:
   a. Adding the first two digits (8 and 2): We get 10, so we add 1 to the next digit (1): The sum is 11 = 1 A (A is the tens digit), and the sum of the ones digits is 2.
   b. Adding 1 A (11) and the next number (6): 
      i. Write down the tens digit of the result (1 A + 6 = 7)
      ii. Write the sum of the ones digits: 1 + 1 + 6 = 8
      iii. The result has a carry 1 to the hundreds place, so we write down 1 besides the result in step b to show the carry.
      iv. Finally, we have the result as: 11 + 6 = 1 A 8 (formally 11A8).

Since there's no need to evaluate parentheses, exponents, or other unspecified mathematical operations in our example problem, we don't need to apply those operations.

Therefore, the answer is: The answer is 1A8 (or 118).

1. Identify the operations that need to be performed and their precedence, based on the updated order of operations.
2. Perform the operation inside the parentheses, if any.
3. Perform exponentiation.
4. Perform prime factor counting.
5. Perform multiplication and division from left to right.
6. Perform addition and subtraction from left to right.
7. Perform concatenation.

In our given expression, 5 + 3 # 2, there are no parentheses, exponents, or concatenation operations. However, there are prime factor counting (#), multiplication (implied between the numbers), addition (+), and subtraction (implied between the sign of the second number and the first number).

Based on the updated order of operations, we should perform:

1. Prime factor counting (#): 3 # 2 = 1 (we have shared prime factor 2)
2. Addition (+): 5 + 1 = 6

1. Prime factor counting: 
We first perform prime factor counting for both 8 and 2, and 6.

For 8: 2^3 (2 as prime factor multiplicity is 3)
For 2: 2^1 (2 as prime factor multiplicity is 1)

For 6: 2^1, 3^1 (2 and 3 as prime factors each with multiplicity 1)

Since the only shared prime factor is 2, the prime factor counting is 2.

2. Multiplication and Division (MD):
We do not have any multiplication or division operations in our current expression, so we move on to the next step.

3. Addition and Subtraction (AS):
We need to evaluate the addition operations + inside the # signs.

The expression becomes: 8 # (2 + 6)

4. Concatenation (C):
Since we have an addition operation inside # symbols, we perform that step first, not concatenation. However, since there are no parentheses involved, we can still proceed as follows.

We have 2 + 6 = 8, as 4+2=6+2=8.

So, now our expression is: 8 # 8

5. Multiplication and Division (MD):
Now, since there are no multiplication or division operations left, we move directly to the next operation.

6. Prime Factor counting (F):
As we have already calculated the prime factor counting earlier for 8, we have it as a reference. The only shared prime factor between 8 and 8 is 2, so the prime factor counting is 2.

7. Exponents (E):
There are no exponents in our given expression, so we move to the next operation.

8. Concatenation (C):
Now, we perform concatenation operation. Concatenating 2 (the result of prime factor counting) and 2 (from the previous step), we get 22 as our final answer.

Thus, the final answer is: The answer is 22."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt3_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 4#3 + 2 using the revised order of operations PEFMDASC, let's follow these steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): We first need to determine the prime factors shared between the absolute values of 4 and 3 using the # operator. Since there is no common prime factor, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 0.

2. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Now, we perform addition since it is next in the order of operations. In this case, it's just adding 2 to the result of the prime factor counting operation, which is 0, resulting in 2.

So the answer is 2.

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.
