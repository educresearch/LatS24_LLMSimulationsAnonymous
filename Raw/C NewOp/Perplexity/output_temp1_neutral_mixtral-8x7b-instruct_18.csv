1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in this problem, so we move on to the next operation.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this problem, so we move on to the next operation.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We calculate the prime factors of 2 @ 4. The number 2 @ 4 = 24, and its prime factors are 2 and 3 (with no shared prime factors between the absolute values of 2 and 4). Therefore, 2 # 4 = 0.
4. Multiplication and Division (M and D): There are no multiplication or division operations in this problem.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A and S): There is an addition operation, but we cannot proceed until we resolve 2 # 4, which is 0.

                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

In this case, there are no Parentheses (P), Exponents (E), Multiplication or Division (M/D), or Addition or Subtraction (A/S) to handle first. We have to deal with Prime Factor Counting (F) and Concatenation (C) from left to right.

1. Calculate 8 # 2:
Prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2.
Prime factors of 2 are 2.
Since there is only one shared prime factor, 2, we have 8 # 2 = 1.

2. Calculate 6 # 6:
Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
Since there are two shared prime factors, 2 and 3, we have 6 # 6 = 2.

3. Finally, add the two results:
1 (from 8 # 2) + 2 (from 6 # 6)

The answer is 3."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:

The expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses
14 + 4 = 18

So, the expression now becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents (there are no exponents in this expression)

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Prime factors of 18 are 2 and 3. Prime factors of 2 are 2. Therefore, 2 and 3 are shared prime factors, so:
2 # 3 = 1

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (there are no multiplication or division in this expression)

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction
First, perform concatenation:
6 @ 18 = 618
Then, do addition and subtraction from left to right:
618 + 12 - 1 = 630 - 1 = 629

The answer is 629."

The expression given is: 5 + 3 # 2

First, we perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation as it appears in the order of operations.

To perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation, we calculate the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 3 and 2:

Prime factors of 3: 3
Prime factors of 2: 2

Since there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2 (0 shared prime factors), we have:

3 # 2 = 0

Now, substitute the value 0 for the prime factor counting operation in the original expression:

5 + 0

Lastly, perform the Addition (A) operation, as it is the first operation in the remaining sequence:

The answer is 5."
