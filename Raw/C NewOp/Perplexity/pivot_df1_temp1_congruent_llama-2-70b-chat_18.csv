llama-2-70b-chat,1,700,systemPrompt3,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: The answer is 8.

Explanation:

First, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation, which is denoted as 3#2. This operation counts the unique prime factors common to |3| and |2|. In this case, the prime factors of 3 are 1 and 3, and the prime factors of 2 are 1 and 2. Since there is only one shared prime factor, which is 1, the result of 3#2 is 1.

Next, we need to evaluate the addition (A) operation, which is denoted as 5 + 1. This operation adds the values of 5 and 1, resulting in 6.

Therefore, the final answer is 6."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,700,systemPrompt4,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Sure! Here's the step-by-step explanation for the problem 5+2 @ 4 using the PEFMDASC order:

1. First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 2 @ 4 = 2concat(4) = 024 = 24.
2. Next, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting: 5 # 24 = 5 # (2 * 2 * 2 * 3) = 1 (since there is only one shared prime factor, 2).
3. Then, we need to evaluate the multiplication: 5 * 24 = 5 * (2 * 2 * 2 * 3) = 5 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 = 200.
4. Finally, we need to evaluate the addition: 5 + 200 = 205.

llama-2-70b-chat,1,700,systemPrompt4,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: Sure, let's work through this expression using the PEFMDASC order:

1. Evaluate the prime factor counting first:

8 # 2 = 8 # 2 = 0 (since there are no shared prime factors between 8 and 2)

6 # 6 = 6 # 6 = 1 (since there is only one shared prime factor, 3, between 6 and 6)

2. Next, evaluate the concatenation:

8 @ 2 = 8 @ 2 = 16

6 @ 6 = 6 @ 6 = 36

3. Now, evaluate the addition:

16 + 36 = 52

4. Finally, evaluate the multiplication (there is no division in this expression):

52 * 1 = 52

The answer is 52.

It's worth noting that when we encounter a # b, we need to find the shared prime factors between |a| and |b|. So, for example, 8 # 2 = 0 because there are no shared prime factors between 8 and 2. Similarly, 6 # 6 = 1 because there is only one shared prime factor, 3, between 6 and 6."
