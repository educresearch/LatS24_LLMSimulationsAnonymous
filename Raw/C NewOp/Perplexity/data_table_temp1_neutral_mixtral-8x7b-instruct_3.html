      <td>GPT Response: Let's go through the problem step by step, following the new order of operations (PEFMDASC).<br><br>1. Parentheses: Calculate the expression within the parentheses first: 14 + 4 = 18.<br>2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this problem, so we can proceed to the next operation.<br>3. Prime Factor counting (F): We have a prime factor counting operation (#) involving 2 and 3. Calculate this next. However, it is easier to do this part at the end. So, for now, leave it as 2 # 3 and remember that the solution to this part will be 0.<br>4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There are no multiplication or division operations in this problem, so we can proceed to the next operation.<br>5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Now, calculate the addition and subtraction operations from left to right.<br>a. Calculate the concatenation (C) part: 6 @ 18.<br><br>b.

      <td>GPT Response: Let's break down the expression using the revised order of operations, PEFMDASC:<br><br>1. **Parentheses:** Calculate the expression within the parentheses first: 14 + 4 = 18.<br><br>So we have 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3.<br><br>1. **Exponents:** There are no exponents in this expression.<br><br>So we move to the next step.<br><br>1. **Prime Factor counting (F):** Evaluate the shared prime factors between 6 @ 18 and 2 in 2 # 3. We don't know the result of 6 @ 18 yet, so let's calculate that first.<br><br>1. **Concatenation (C):** Perform the concatenation operation first because it is higher in the order of operations. Concatenate 6 with 18: 6 @ 18 = 618.<br><br>Now, we move back to step 3 and do the Prime Factor counting (F).<br><br>1. **Prime Factor counting (F):** Count the unique prime factors shared between 618 and 2. Since 618 is not a prime number, it doesn't reshare a factor with 2. So, 618 # 2 = 0 (no shared prime factor).<br><br>Now, we move to the next step.<br><br>1. **Multiplication and Division (MD):** Neither are present in this expression.<br><br>1. **Addition and Subtraction (AS):** Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.<br><br>618 + 12 - 2 # 3 = 630 - 2 # 3 (from left to right). Now, perform the subtraction operation first.<br><br>628 # 3 = 4 (since the only shared prime factors are 2 and 3).<br><br>Finally, we have the complete expression with no more operations.<br><br>**The answer is 624.**<br><br>So, 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 = 624.</td>
