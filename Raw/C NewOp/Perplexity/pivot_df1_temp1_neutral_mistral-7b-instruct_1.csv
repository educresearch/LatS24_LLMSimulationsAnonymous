mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to evaluate what is inside the concatenation sign ""@"". In this case, we have the number 2 concatenated with the digits of the number 4. So, we join the digits of the number 4 to get 4, and then concatenate 2 with 4 to get 24.

Now, since addition comes before concatenation in the order of operations, we can perform the addition 5 + 2, which gives us 7.

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 7."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to identify which operations fall into each category. In this case, we have the prime factor counting (#) operation and the concatenation (@) operation. Since neither operation falls under parentheses, exponents, multiplication/division, or addition/subtraction, we will evaluate them last in the given order, which is concatenation followed by prime factor counting.

So, the solution would be:

1. Perform the prime factor counting operation (#) for the numbers 8 and 6:
   Since there is no shared prime factor between 8 (2³²) and 6 (2²⁴), their prime factor counting result is 0.

2. Now, perform the concatenation operation (@) for the results of the prime factor counting operation (which are 0 in this case).
   Since 0 @ 0 results in 0, the final answer is:

The answer is 0."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow the order as given:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Since there is no explicit multiplication or division inside the parentheses, we can skip the prime factor counting step for now.
2. Parentheses (P): None present in the expression, so we move on to the next step.
3. Exponents (E): None present in the expression, so we move on to the next step.
4. Prime Factor Counting (F): As mentioned earlier, there is no explicit multiplication or division in the given expression. However, we do have the prime factor counting operation defined between two numbers, 4 and 3. We should have calculated this before dealing with the addition, according to the new order of operations. So, the answer for 4 # 3 is 0 because there are no common prime factors shared between 4 and 3.
5. Multiplication and Division (MD): None present in the expression, so we move on to the next step.
6. Addition and Subtraction (AS): Now we have an addition, 4 # 3 + 2
7. Concatenation (C): Since there is an addition operation, we cannot perform concatenation directly. We need to follow the addition operation before concatenation.

So, according to the new order of operations, we should calculate 4 # 3 first, which is 0. Therefore, the final answer would be:

The answer is 0."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression using the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first need to deal with the parentheses:

(14 + 4)
= 18 (adding the numbers inside the parentheses)

Now, we apply the operations according to the new order:

6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 (we evaluate what is inside the parentheses first)

For concatenation, we write the digits of the numbers next to each other:

6 @ 18 = 618

Next, we perform subtraction since it appears before concatenation in the order of operations:

618 + 12 - 2
= 620 - 2
= 618 (since we can't subtract 2 from 12 directly)

Now, we perform the prime factor counting operation:

618 # 3
No shared prime factors, so the result is 0.

Finally, we perform concatenation again to combine the result of the prime factor counting operation with the previous result:

0 @ 618
Results in a final answer of 0618.

The answer is 0618."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression 5 + 3 # 2 using the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow these steps:

   - Prime factors of 5: 5
   - Prime factors of 3: 2, 3
   - Prime factors of 2: 2

2. Since 3 and 2 share the prime factor 2, we have a count of 1 for the prime factor counting operation #.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the given Mathematics problem with the newly introduced mathematical operations and the updated order of operations, we need to follow the order of operations carefully:

1. Concatenation (C): Since concatenation is next to addition (A) in the new order of operations, we need to perform concatenation first. In this problem, we have 2 @ 4, which represents the concatenation of the digits of the absolute values of 2 and 4. Therefore, 2 @ 4 = 24.
2. Addition (A): Now that we have the result of concatenation, we need to perform addition. So, the problem becomes 5 + 24.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow these steps:

1. Prime factor counting: Find the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of the given numbers.
   (a) For 8 # 2: prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and prime factors of 2 are 2, so they share one prime factor 2; therefore, 8 # 2 = 1.
   (b) For 6 # 6: prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and prime factors of 6 are 2 and 2, so they share two prime factors 2, and one is repeated; thus, 6 # 6 = 2.

2. Addition: Perform addition from left to right.
   (a) Since prime factor counting has higher precedence than addition, we first calculate 8 # 2 = 1 and 6 # 6 = 2.
   (b) Then, we add the results: 1 + 2 = 3.

The answer is 3."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: Based on the newly updated order of operations PEFMDASC, the solution to the given problem 4 # 3 + 2 would be as follows:

1. Prime Factor counting (#): We first need to perform the prime factor counting operation between 4 and 3. Since 4 has prime factors 2 and 2, and 3 has prime factors 3, there is no shared prime factor, so the result of this operation is 0.

2. Addition (A): Next, we can perform the addition operation, which in this case is simply adding the result of the prime factor counting operation (0) to the number 2. Therefore, the sum is 2.

Hence, the final answer to this problem, according to the newly introduced mathematical operations and updated order of operations, is:

The answer is 2."

1. Parentheses: First, we need to solve the expression inside the parentheses.
   = 14 + 4
   = 18

2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this problem, so we move on to the next operation.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F): Let's find the unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of the digits of 6 and the result of the parentheses (18).
   = 6 # 18
   = 0

   Since there's no shared prime factor, the prime factor counting result is 0.

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There are no multiplication and division operations in this problem, so we move on to the next operation.

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S):
   We already did the addition inside the parentheses in step 1.
   Now we need to perform the subtraction.
    = 18 @ 6 - 2

6. Concatenation (C): Since we have the subtraction result and the concatenation operation, we perform the subtraction first:

1. Identify the prime factor counting operation (#): 3 # 2
2. Perform the prime factor counting operation: Since the prime factors of 3 are 3, and the prime factors of 2 are 2, there is only one shared prime factor, so the prime factor counting operation results in 1.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the problem with the updated mathematical operations and order of operations, first, we need to follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. Parentheses: We have none here.
2. Exponents: We have none here.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We don't need this operation in this equation.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D, left to right): We have @ which is a concatenation, but it is a binary operation that is neither multiplication nor division. So, we don't apply this operation here.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S, left to right): We have + and @. First, perform the addition since it comes before concatenation in the order of operations.

5 + 2 = 7

Now, since @ (concatenation) is the last operation, we can apply it to the result.

7 @ 4 = 74

So, the solution to the problem 5 + 2 @ 4 is the final answer:

The answer is 74."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 8 # 2 + 6 # 6, we first need to apply the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC). Since prime factor counting comes before addition, we'll perform prime factor counting for both numbers individually, 8 and 2, and 6.

Prime factorization for 8: 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 2^4
Prime factorization for 2: 2
Prime factorization for 6: 2 × 2 × 3

Now we calculate the prime factor count (#) between them:

Since 2 is a common prime factor with a count of 2 in both numbers, the prime factor count between 8 and 2 is 2.
The prime factor count between 2 and 6 is 2, as well.

So, the prime factor count (#) for both expressions is 2. Now, we can evaluate the addition operation.

Since addition comes before concatenation, we first add the results of the prime factor counting:

2 + 2 = 4

Now, we perform the concatenation operation on the results of the addition:

4 @ 6 = 46

So, the solution is:

The answer is 46."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression ""4 # 3 + 2"" using the newly introduced mathematical operations and the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow these steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting (#):
   Since there's no negative number in this expression, prime factor counting of 4 and 3 would give us 2 as the result since the common prime factors of 4 and 3 are 2.

2. Concatenation (@):
   Now, we need to perform concatenation of the result of the prime factor counting step (2) and the remaining number (2).

So the solution would be:

4 # 3 = 2
4 @ 2 = 42 (since multiplication of 4 and 2 results in 8, and then concatenating 4 and 8 results in 42 due to the updated order of operations)

The answer is 42."

3. Exponents: None in this expression.

4. Multiplication and Division (from left to right):
   - 6 @ 18: Concatenation (6 and 1) first, and then concatenate the result (6) with 18. So, 6 @ 18 = 618.

5. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right):
   - 618 + 12: Add the digits in each place value, 8 + 1 = 9, and move to the next place value. Add 1 and 2, which makes 3. So, the sum is 93.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 5 + 3 # 2, we need to follow the updated order of operations: PEFMDASC.

First, we perform prime factor counting (F) for the numbers involved in the problem, i.e., 5, 3, and 2. Here, we find that prime factors of 5 are 5, prime factors of 3 are 3, and prime factors of 2 are 2. Since there are no shared prime factors between 5 and 3, and between 3 and 2, prime factor counting (F) gives us 0 for all three combinations.

Then we evaluate multiplication and division (M/D). However, in this problem, there is no multiplication or division presented.

Next is addition and subtraction (A/S), which we evaluate from left to right. In this problem, we have 5 and 3, so we perform 5 + 3.

The final step is concatenation (C). Since there is no '@' operator present, we don't need to perform concatenation.

Therefore, the final answer, considering the given problem and the updated order of operations, is:

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in this expression, so we move on to the next operation.

2. Exponents: None present, so we continue to the next operation.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We do not have the ability to perform prime factor counting as it involves finding the prime factors of numbers. Concatenation (C) comes before prime factor counting in the order of operations, so we need to proceed to the next operation.

4. Concatenation (C): Since we are not dealing with expressions in parentheses, exponents, or involving prime factor counting at the moment, we can directly evaluate the concatenation operation: 2 @ 4 = 24

5. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There is no multiplication or division in this expression, so we move on to the next operation.

6. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): However, there is an addition sign (+) present in the expression, so we need to evaluate the addition before concatenation: 5 + 24 = 29

1. Prime factor counting (F): Find the prime factor count of each pair of numbers and perform the operation.

   For the first term, 8 # 2:
   Prime factors of 8: 2, 2, 2, 2

mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), follow these steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting: 
   First, we need to find the prime factor count (#) between the absolute values of the numbers 4 and 3. In this case, prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and prime factors of 3 are 3. So, there is no shared prime factor. Therefore, the prime factor count equals 0.

2. Addition:
   Since we cannot perform concatenation on integers directly, let's move on to the addition operation. In our expression, we only have the number 2 to add to the result of the concatenation operation. So, the addition step comes after the concatenation operation in the PEFMDASC order.

In summary, the step-by-step solution in the correct order is:

1. Prime Factor Counting: 0
2. Concatenation: We cannot perform concatenation on integers directly; however, the expression doesn't have integers being concatenated, only the numbers 4 and 3 are given. To handle this expression, we need to apply the provision mentioned at the end of your instruction which states ""It's crucial to get this right for accurate calculations."" and ""Negative Prompts: Do Not generalize or use examples not directly related to the given operations and expressions."" Since the given expression does not include the new operation concatenation (C), the expression is incorrect in its current form and needs to be corrected by providing valid inputs for concatenation, such as numbers with lengths greater than 1 or strings.
