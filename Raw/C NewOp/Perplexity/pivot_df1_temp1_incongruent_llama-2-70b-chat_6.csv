llama-2-70b-chat,1,700,systemPrompt4,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step, using the updated order of operations:

1. Evaluate the first operation: 8 # 2

In this case, we have to calculate the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 8 and 2. The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2, and 1, while the prime factors of 2 are 2 and 1. Therefore, the count of shared prime factors is 2. So, 8 # 2 = 2.

2. Evaluate the second operation: 6 # 6

The prime factors of 6 are 2, 3, and 1. Since there are no shared prime factors between 6 and itself, 6 # 6 = 0.

3. Evaluate the addition: 2 + 0

This is straightforward: 2 + 0 = 2.

4. Evaluate the concatenation: 2 @ 6

We join the digits of |2| and |6| together: 2 @ 6 = 26.
