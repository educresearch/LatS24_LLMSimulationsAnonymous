mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC). According to this order, we need to perform Prime Factor counting (F) before Addition and Subtraction (A, S).

So, for the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6, we first calculate the Prime Factor counting (F) for the terms 8 # 2 and 6 # 6.

The Prime Factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and the Prime Factors of 2 are 2. So, the Prime Factors shared by 8 and 2 are 2. Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1.

Similarly, the Prime Factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the Prime Factors of 6 are 2 and 3. So, the Prime Factors shared by 6 and 6 are 2 and 3. Therefore, 6 # 6 = 2.

Now, we can substitute these values in the original expression:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 2 = 3

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Let's break down the expression using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. Parentheses: Calculate the value within the parentheses first, 14 + 4 = 18.
2. Prime Factor Counting (F): We have 2#3, which means counting the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 2 and 3. Since the only prime factor of 2 is 2 and 3 has no other prime factors, the result of 2#3 is 0.
3. Concatenation (C): Now, let's calculate 6 @ 18. Concatenation combines the digits of the absolute values of 6 and 18, so 6 @ 18 = 618.
4. Subtraction (S): Finally, subtract the result of step 2 from the result of step 3, so 618 + 12 - 0 = 630.
