Concatenation<br><br>Given expression is 4 # 3 + 2.<br><br>Since the expression does not contain any parentheses, exponents, or concatenation, we will start with prime factor counting:<br><br>1. Prime Factor Counting: In this case, we have to check the common prime factors between 4 and 3. The prime factors of 3 are 3, and the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2. Since there is no common prime factor between 3 and 4, the prime factor count is 0.<br><br>Now, we will move to the next operation in the order:<br><br>2. Addition and Subtraction (left to right): In this expression, we already performed the addition operation implicitly when we wrote "3 + 2" because the addition symbol (+) has a higher precedence than concatenation (C) symbol (@) according to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC). So, the expression "3 + 2" evaluates to 5. Therefore, the expression becomes "4 # 5."<br><br>Based on the given prime factor count rule, we know that the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2. Since the prime factors of 5 are 5, there are no common prime factors between 4 and 5. Hence, Prime Factor Count # ("#") operation results in 0.<br><br>Therefore, based on the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), the expression 4 # 3 + 2 evaluates to 0.<br><br>The answer is 0.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the PEFMDASC order, follow these steps:<br><br>1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Let's find the unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 4 and 3, and between 4 and 2:<br>   a. For 4 and 3: Since the prime factors of 4 are 2² and 2³, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3, there is no shared prime factor. So, 4 # 3 = 0.<br>   b. For 4 and 2: The prime factors of 4 are 2² and 2³, and those of 2 are just 2. There is one shared prime factor, 2. So, 4 # 2 = 1.<br><br>2. Multiply/Divide (M/D): Since there is no division in this expression, we can skip this step.<br><br>3. Exponents (E): Since there is no exponent in this expression, we can skip this step.<br><br>4. Prime Factor Counting (F) again: Now, let's find the unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of the result from step 1, and the number 2:<br>   a. For 0 and 2: Since there are no shared prime factors between 0 and 2, 0 # 2 = 0.<br><br>5. Addition/Subtraction (A/S): Perform the addition operation with the result from step 4 and the number 2:<br>   a. 0 + 2 = 2<br><br>6.
