mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC). According to this order, we should perform the prime factor counting operation before addition or subtraction.

So, for the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6, we first calculate the prime factor counting operations:

8 # 2 = 2 (since the prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2 and of 2 is just 2, so they share one prime factor)

6 # 6 = 1 (since the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 and of 6 are also 2 and 3, they share no prime factors)

Now, the expression becomes 2 + 6 = 8.

Therefore,

The answer is 8."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: Following the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we start by performing the prime factor counting (F) operation:

2 + 2
= 4

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to evaluate the concatenation operation before the addition.

First, calculate the value of 2 @ 4.

2 @ 4 = 24 (since the concatenation of the digits of |2| and |4| is 24)

Now, substitute this value into the original expression and evaluate:

5 + 24 = 29

Therefore, the answer is 29."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the expression $8 \#{2} + 6 \#{6}$, we first need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation.

The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since they share one prime factor, we have $8 \#{2} = 1$.
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 6 are 2, 3. Since they share two prime factors, we have $6 \#{6} = 2$.

Then, we have $8 \#{2} + 6 \#{6} = 1 + 2 = 3.$

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we start by performing the prime factor counting (F) operation:

4 # 3 + 2
= 1 + 2 (since the only prime factor of 4 is 2, and the only prime factor of 3 is 3, so they share 1 prime factor, which is 1)

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Let's go step by step through the problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. First, perform the operation inside the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18
2. Now, we have 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3
3. Next, concatenation (C) comes before addition and subtraction (A/S), so calculate 6 @ 18 = 618
4. Now we have 618 + 12 - 2#3
5. Perform addition and subtraction (A/S) from left to right: 618 + 12 = 630 - 2#3
6. Calculate the prime factor counting (F) for the expression 2#3: there is only one shared prime factor (2), so 2#3 = 1
7. Finally, perform subtraction with 630 - 1:

The answer is 629."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: Let's go through the problem step by step according to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. There are no parentheses or exponents in this problem, so we move on to the next operation.
2. There is no prime factor counting (F) or multiplication/division (M/D) in this problem, so we move on to the next operation.
3. Now we have addition (A) and concatenation (C) left. According to the order of operations, we should do concatenation first before addition.
4. The concatenation of 5 and 3 is 53, and the result of that concatenation is 53.
5. Now, we have 53 + 2, which simplifies to 55 (since 53 is a two-digit number and concatenation happened first, 2 is a single-digit number).

The answer is 55."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), which means we perform the operations from left to right in the following order: Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction, and Concatenation.

Given expression: 5 + 2@4

In this expression, we only have addition and concatenation. First, we perform the concatenation operation (according to the order of operations):

5 + 2@4
= 5 + 24 (since 2@4 = 24)

Now, with the new order of operations, even though concatenation is after addition, we still need to follow the left-to-right rule. So we perform the addition:

5 + 24
= 29

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 29."

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. There are no Parentheses, Exponents, or Prime Factor counting (F) in this expression, so we can skip those steps.
2. There are no Multiplication or Division (M/D) in this expression, so we can skip those steps as well.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: Let's solve this problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Calculate the prime factors shared between the absolute values of 4 and 3.
   Prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
   Prime factors of 3 are 3 (since 3 is a prime number).
   There are no shared prime factors, so 4 # 3 = 0.

2. Addition (A): Add the result from step 1 to 2.
   The value remains 0 as there is no change from step 1.

So, the answer is:

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Step 1: Follow the order of operations and start with the operation inside the parentheses. Calculate 14 + 4.
14 + 4 = 18

Step 2: Now we have (18) next to the @ operation. However, we cannot proceed with the concatenation operation yet, because there is another operation (+) inside the parentheses that needs to be done first. Continue with calculating 6 @ 18.
6 @ 18 = 618 (since the concatenation of 6 and 18 is 618)

Step 3: Next is the + operation. Calculate 618 + 12.
618 + 12 = 630

Step 4: We now have 2 # 3 just before the - operation. Calculate 2 # 3.
2 # 3 = 0 (since prime factors of 2 are 2, and prime factors of 3 are 3, and there are no shared prime factors)

Step 5: Finally, perform the - operation. Subtract 0 from 630.
630 - 0 = 630

The answer is 630."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: Step 1: Evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation.
To do this, first identify the shared prime factors between the absolute values of the numbers.

The absolute values of 5 and 2 are 5 and 2, respectively. Prime factors of 5 are 5, and prime factors of 2 are 2. There are no shared prime factors.

So, 5 # 2 = 0.

Step 2: Evaluate the Addition (A) operation.
Now that you have completed the Prime Factor Counting operation, proceed to the traditional order of operations, PEMDAS/PEFMDASC, and evaluate the addition.

5 + 0 = 5.

The answer is 5."
