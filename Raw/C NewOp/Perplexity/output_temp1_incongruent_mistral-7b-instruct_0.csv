                    Two new operations were defined:

                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):

1. Prime Factor Counting: Since there is no concatenation involved here, we directly move on to the next step.
2. Multiplication and Division: There is no multiplication or division present in the given expression, so we move on to the next step.
3. Addition and Subtraction: We have an addition sign (+) and concatenation operation (C: @). According to the order of operations, we need to evaluate the concatenation operation before the addition sign.
4. Concatenation: In the given problem, we have 2@4. According to the concatenation operation definition, we need to concatenate the digits of the absolute values of 2 and 4. The absolute value of 2 is 2, and the absolute value of 4 is 4. So, 2@4 = 24.
5. Addition: Now, we have 5 + 24. Performing the addition operation, we get 29.

systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression with the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow these steps:

1. Parentheses:
   We have one pair of parentheses (14 + 4).
   Satisfy the parentheses first: 18 (sum of 14 and 4)
2. Exponents:
   There are no exponents in the expression, so we move on to the next step.
3. Prime Factor Counting:
   We have one pair of operations with ""#"" symbol, i.e., 2#3.
   Calculate prime factor counting before addition, subtraction, and concatenation:
   * For number 2: prime factors are 2.
   * For number 3: prime factors are 3.
   However, there are no common prime factors between 2 and 3. So, the result is 0.
4. Multiplication, Division (L to R):
   We don't have any multiplication or division operations in the expression. So, we move on to the next step.
5. Addition, Subtraction (L to R):
   We have one addition operation (+) and one subtraction operation (-).
   Since addition comes before subtraction in the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we perform the addition operation first:
   6 @ 18 + 12
6. Concatenation:
   We have one concatenation operation (@).
   Concatenation is the last step in the updated order of operations.
   In this case, we have to concatenate two numbers, 6 and 18.
   So, we perform the concatenation operation: 6@18 = 618

Therefore, the answer (with the new order of operations) is:

The answer is 618."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

However, in this given problem, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we need to focus on prime factor counting (F), multiplication and division (M/D), addition and subtraction (A/S), and concatenation (C) in that order.

1. Parentheses: We have a set of parentheses (14 + 4), so we need to evaluate this expression first:
   14 + 4 = 18

2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this expression, so we can skip this step.

3. Prime Factor counting (F): We need to calculate the prime factor count for both 6 and 18:
   Prime factors of 6: 2, 3
   Prime factors of 18: 2, 2, 3
   Since the prime factor counts of 6 and 18 share two '2's, the prime factor count of their concatenation (6 @ 18) is:
   F(6 @ 18) = F(6)F(18) = 2 * 3 = 6

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There is no multiplication or division in this expression, so we can skip this step.

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Addition is done before subtraction:
   Six @ 18 + 12 = 6 @ 20 (since we need to evaluate the concatenation before addition)
   Using this concatenation result, subtraction can be performed:
   6 @ 20 - 2 = 6 @ 18 = 618

1. Parentheses (none in this problem): none.
2. Exponents: none.
3. Prime Factor Counting (#): none.
4. Multiplication and Division (MD): 2@4, which is concatenation of 2 and 4.
5. Addition and Subtraction (AS): 5 and 2@4 (since we need to evaluate addition before concatenation).

So, we first evaluate the concatenation inside the multiplication (2@4), which results in 24. Then we perform the addition of 5 and 24:

The answer is 29."

1. Prime Factor Counting (#): 
   We first need to find the unique prime factors common to the numbers 8 and 2, and to the numbers 6 and 6. Since 8's prime factors are 2³ and 2, and 2's prime factors are only 2, there is only 1 shared prime factor. Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1.
   For 6 # 6, since 6's prime factors are 2² and 3, and both 2² and 3 are prime factors, there are two shared prime factors. Thus, 6 # 6 = 2.

2. Exponents (E): less relevant in this problem as no exponent was given.
3. Multiplication and Division (M/D):
   Since there is no multiplication or division sign in the problem, we can skip this step.

4. Addition and Subtraction (A/S):
   Following the order of addition and subtraction, we add the results of the prime factor counts within each pair: 1 + 2 = 3.

5. Concatenation (C):
   We concatenate the results of the prime factor count and the addition step: 3 @ 1 = 31 and 3 @ 2 = 32.

The answer is 31 or 32, depending on the order of concatenating the results of the prime factor count and addition within this last step. However, without additional context, it's impossible to determine which order is intended, but both possibilities are valid according to the new mathematics rules presented."

                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)

Since there are no parentheses or exponents, we begin with prime factor counting (F). 

First, let's calculate the prime factor counting for 2, 3, and 5:

For 2: 2
For 3: 3
For 5: 1

Since prime factors 2 and 3 appear in both 2 and 3, and 5 is only a prime factor of 5, we have 2 unique shared prime factors: 2. Thus, 5 # 3 = 2 # 3 = 2.

Now, we can perform the addition as the operation after prime factor counting:

To find the prime factor count between each pair of numbers, we first find the absolute values of the numbers: |8| = 8 and |2| = 2, |6| = 6.

For 8 and 2, the prime factors are 2, 2, and 2 for 8, and 2 for 2. We have 2 prime factors in common, so the prime factor count is F(8, 2) = 2.

For 6 and 2, the prime factors are 2 and 3 for 6, and 2 for 2. Since there is only 1 common prime factor, the prime factor count is F(6, 2) = 1.

For 6 and 6, the prime factors are 2 and 2 and 2 for 6 twice, so there are 3 common prime factors. Hence, the prime factor count is F(6, 6) = 3.

For 2 and 6 # 6, we calculate F(2, 6) first, which is 1 (prime factor 2 is only present in 2), F(2, 6) = 1, then we calculate F(6, 6) = 3, as stated above. The concatenation operation comes last, so we don't need to perform any calculation with the prime factor count results.

Step 2: Concatenation (C)
Since the prime factor counting is already done and concatenation comes last, we don't need to do any further calculations.

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Calculate the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 4 and 3.
Since prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and prime factors of 3 are 3, the result is 0, because there are no shared prime factors.

2. Addition and Subtraction (AS): Evaluate the addition operation (+) between the results of step 1 and the constant 2.
Result: 0 + 2 = 2.

Therefore, the answer is: The answer is 2.

We have followed the PEFMDASC order by first considering the prime factor counting operation and then moving on to the addition operation."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 3 # 2 using the PEFMDASC order, follow these steps:

Step 1: Identify the operations involved in the expression.
We have two arithmetic operations: addition (+) and prime factor counting (#).

Step 2: Evaluate Prime Factor Counting.
Since # is an earlier operation in the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to perform the prime factor counting before any addition. In this case, we have 2 as the second operand for the # operation, but since both operands are positive, prime factors of 3 and 2 are 2 and 2 respectively. So, the prime factor counting operation yields a result of 2.

 Step 3: Perform Addition.
Now we can perform the addition operation, but we have to be careful since the operands aren't directly addable due to the result of the prime factor counting. In this step, we are actually performing concatenation as the ""+"" sign is used to represent concatenation in this context. Since the result of the prime factor counting operation is a number with a value of 2, we can concatenate it to the number 5 by writing it as 5_ (an underscore is used here to represent the separation caused by performing prime factor counting before concatenation). Therefore, our current expression becomes 5_3.

To complete the concatenation operation, we need the second number, which in our case is 3. So, we'll proceed with 5_3 @ 3.

 Step 4: Perform Concatenation.
The concatenation of 5 and 3 results in the final answer:
The answer is: 53."
