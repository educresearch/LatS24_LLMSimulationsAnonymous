As for the negative prompts, here are some examples of what to avoid:

* Don't assume traditional order of operations (PEMDAS) and instead use the updated PEFMDASC.
* Don't skip steps or assume familiarity with the new operations.
* Don't generalize or use examples not directly related to the given operations and expressions.

For example, don't write: ""We can simply use PEMDAS to solve this problem..."" or ""This problem is similar to the previous one, so we can just use the same approach..."" Instead, always follow the PEFMDASC order and explain each step clearly, highlighting the use of the new operations and their placement in the order of operations."
