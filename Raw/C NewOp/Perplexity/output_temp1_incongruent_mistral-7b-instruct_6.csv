1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses, so we move on to the next step.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents, so we move on to the next step.
3. Prime Factor Counting: We don't have two numbers to count shared prime factors, so we move on to the next step.
4. Multiplication and Division (L to R): There is no multiplication or division in this expression, so we move on to the next step.
5. Addition and Subtraction (L to R): We have the addition sign (+) and the @ symbol, which represents the concatenation operation. Since addition comes before concatenation, we need to first evaluate 2@4 = 24.

So, our problem now is 5 + 24, and following the order of operations, we compute:

5 + 24 = 19

systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression following the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to deal with the parentheses:

1. (14 + 4)
2. = 18

Now, we apply the concatenation operation:

3. 6 @ 18

Since addition and concatenation have the same precedence, we evaluate the addition inside the parentheses first and then apply concatenation:

4. 6 @ 24 (Since 18 + 4 = 22 and 2 < 10, we evaluate the addition first, then apply concatenation.)

Now, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation:

5. 6 # 24

Since the concatenation is after prime factor counting in the new order of operations, we need to calculate the prime factor counting first:

6. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
7. The prime factors of 24 are 2, 2, 2 and 3.
8. There are 1 unique prime factor in common, which is 2.

So, the result of step 5 is: 1.

Now we finally apply the concatenation operation:

7. 6 @ 24 = 624

The answer is 624."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e.,

                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

There are no parentheses in the given expression, 5 + 3 # 2, so we can proceed without evaluating any parentheses. Now, since 5 and 3 are non-negative integers, we won't have any absolute values. We can move on to the next operations:

1. Concatenation (C): Since we don't have any @ signs, there is no concatenation operation.
2. Prime Factor Counting (F): To evaluate # operation, we need to find the unique prime factors that are shared by both 5 and 3, but there are no common prime factors between these numbers, so # operation between 5 and 3 results in 0.
3. Multiplication and Division (M and D): There are no multiplications or divisions in the expression, so we can skip this step.
4. Addition and Subtraction (A and S): Since we don't have any subtractions, we can directly perform the addition operation (A).

systemPrompt2_userPrompt4_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the problem with the new mathematical operations and the updated order of operations, we need to follow the PEFMDASC rule:

1. Parentheses: First, we need to solve whatever is inside the parentheses.

(14 + 4) = 18

2. Exponents: There are no exponents in the given problem, so we can move on to the next operation.

3. Prime Factor Counting: In this step, we perform prime factor counting on the given numbers.

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

6 @ 18: Concatenating the digits of 6 and 18, we get 24.

18: The prime factorization of 18 is 2 * 2 * 3 * 3.

6 @ 24: Concatenating the digits of 6 and 24, we get 246.

--: Prime factor counting between 6 and -3 is 0 since there are no shared prime factors between those numbers. Now, let's check the prime factorization of -3.

2#-3: Prime factor counting between the absolute values of 2 and -3. Since 3 is a prime number, prime factor counting is equal to 1 for any number with the prime factor -3. However, since the result should be a non-negative number, we cannot have the minus sign in our final answer. So, we will ignore the concatenation operation with -3 and move on to the next operation.

4. Multiplication and Division (left to right): Perform the multiplication and division, assuming we evaluate the first multiplication or division pair.

There are no multiplication or division operations in the given problem.

5. Addition and Subtraction (left to right): Perform the addition and subtraction, assuming we evaluate the first addition or subtraction pair.

Since there are no prime factor counting operations left, we can directly perform the remaining addition and subtraction operations in the updated order of operations.

246 + 12 - 0

Given that 0 is the result of the prime factor counting between 6 and -3, we should not include 12 in the calculation since concatenation with 0 gives 0 as the result.

Therefore, our final answer is:

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in the given expression, so we can skip this step.

2. Exponents: N/A

3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We do not have any numbers given for this step, so we can skip it.

4. Multiplication and division (MD): There is only one 'at' operator, denoted asconcatenation, in the given expression, which is between 2 and 4. However, according to the updated order of operations, we need to perform multiplication and division operations (MD) before concertation (C). Since there is no multiplication or division in the given expression, this step is not applicable, and we can skip it.

5. Addition and Subtraction (AS): We have only one addition operation (+) between two numbers, which are 5 and the concatenation of 2 and 4 (C: 2@4 = 24). According to the updated order of operations, we need to perform addition and subtraction (AS) before concatenation (C). So, the problem can be solved as follows:

1. Parentheses: First, we evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:

systemPrompt3_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem with the new mathematical operations and updated order of operations, we first need to understand the order in which the operations should be performed:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Prime Factor Counting
4. Multiplication and Division (left to right)
5. Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
6. Concatenation

Since there are no parentheses or exponents in this problem, we'll skip the first two steps.

Next, we need to perform prime factor counting (F) to find the unique prime factors common to 5 and 3, as well as 2. Since the prime factors of 5 are 5 and 1, and the prime factors of 3 are 3 and 1, the prime factors of 2 are 2, the common prime factors are 1 and 2. So, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 2. In other words, 5 # 3 # 2 = 2.

Since prime factor counting was involved, we need to account for its result before carrying out any other arithmetic operations. According to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, prime factor counting should be done before addition and subtraction.

So, the problem becomes 5 + 2. Solving this, we get the answer is 7.

Therefore, the answer to the problem 5 + 3 # 2 is 7."

1. Identify and evaluate prime factor counting (F) within the given expression:
Since our expression only contains the prime factor counting sign (@) and numbers, we'll begin by evaluating the prime factor counting operation.

4#3 = 4 # 3 = 0  (Two sets of prime factors, 2, 2 and 3, do not have any common prime factors. Therefore, the result is 0)

2. With the prime factor counting evaluated, the expression becomes: 0 + 2

3. Follow the order by performing addition (A) next:
0 + 2 = 2

So, the solution to the expression 4#3 + 2, using the PEFMDASC order of operations, is: The answer is 2."

1. Parentheses: Solve the expression in the parentheses first.
   = 18 (14 + 4)

2. Exponents: None in this expression.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F): 
   (a) Find the prime factors of 18. Prime factors of 18 are 2, 2, 3, 3, 3.

   (b) Evaluate 6 @ 18 and 12 - 2#3 using the prime factors:
     6 @ 18: Since we need to perform concatenation, we first need to find the absolute values of both numbers: |6| = 6 and |18| = 18. Therefore, 6 @ 18 = 618.
     12 - 2#3: Find the common prime factors, if any:
         Prime factors of 12: 2, 2, 2, 2.
         Prime factors of 3: 3.
     Since 2 and 2 appear multiple times but 3 doesn't, prime factor counting for 12 - 2#3 is 1 (because the count of shared prime factors is 1, 2 is shared 4 times, but 3 is not shared at all).

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): None in this expression.

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S):
   First, perform subtraction: 12 - 1 (since prime factor counting has a lower priority than subtraction), and the result is 11.
   Then perform addition: 618 @ 11 (since concatenation has a lower priority than addition) equals 61811.

6. Concatenation (C): The final answer is 61811.
