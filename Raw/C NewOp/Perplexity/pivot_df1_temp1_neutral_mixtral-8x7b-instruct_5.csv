mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC). According to this order, we should perform Prime Factor counting (F) before Addition and Subtraction (A, S).

First, let's calculate the Prime Factor counting (F) operations:

8 # 2 = 2 (since the prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2 and those of 2 are 2, and there is one shared prime factor 2)

6 # 6 = 2 (since the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 and those of 6 are 2 and 3, and there are two shared prime factors 2 and 3)

Next, perform the Addition operation:

2 + 2 = 4

Therefore, the solution to the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 is 4.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: Let's go through the given expression according to the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. There are no parentheses or exponents, so we proceed to prime factor counting.
2. 14 + 4 evaluates to 18, and 18 and 2 have no shared prime factors, so 2 # 18 = 0.
3. Now we have 6 @ (18) + 12 - 0.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: For the expression 4 # 3 + 2, we need to follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC. According to this order, we should perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation first, then the Exponents (E) operation, followed by Multiplication/Division (M/D), and finally Addition/Subtraction (A/S) and Concatenation (C). However, in this given expression, we only have Prime Factor Counting, Addition, and Concatenation.

The Prime Factor Counting (F) operation, denoted as #, counts the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of the two numbers being operated on. In this case, 4 # 3. The prime factors of 4 are 2, 2, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3. Since there are no shared prime factors between the two numbers, the result of 4 # 3 is 0.

Next, we have the Addition (A) operation. So the result of 4 # 3 gets added to 2 as per the given expression.

Therefore,

4 # 3 + 2 = 0 + 2

1. Calculate 8 # 2:
Prime factors of 8 are 2 * 2 * 2, and prime factors of 2 are 2. We only care about unique prime factors, so there is 1 shared prime factor 2. Thus, 8 # 2 = 1

2. Calculate 6 # 6:
Prime factors of 6 are 2 * 3, and prime factors of 6 are 2 * 3, so there are 2 shared prime factors (2 and 3). Thus, 6 # 6 = 2

3. Now evaluate the Addition (A) part of the operation:

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step using the updated PEFMDASC order of operations.

1. Identify the given mathematical operations and their placement in the order of operations. In this case, we have addition and concatenation.
2. According to PEFMDASC, we should perform calculations in the following order: Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division (left to right), Addition and Subtraction (left to right), and Concatenation (left to right). Since we don't have Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication, or Division in this expression, we skip to Addition and Concatenation.
3. Perform the concatenation operation first, as it comes before Addition in the order of operations.

5 + 2 @ 4
5 + 2 @ 42 (Concatenation: 2 and 4)

4. Now, perform the addition operation.

5 + 2 @ 42
7 @ 42 (Addition: 5 + 2)

Given expression: 4 # 3 + 2

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Perform the Prime Factor Counting operation on 4 and 3:
4 # 3 = Count the shared prime factors between 4 and 3

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, whereas the prime factors of 3 are 3.
Since there are no shared prime factors, the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation results in 0.
