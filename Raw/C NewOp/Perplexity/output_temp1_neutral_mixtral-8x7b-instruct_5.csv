2. 14 + 4 evaluates to 18, and 18 and 2 have no shared prime factors, so 2 # 18 = 0.
3. Now we have 6 @ (18) + 12 - 0.
4. Concatenation is next in the order of operations, so 6 @ 18 = 618.
5. We're now left with 618 + 12 - 0.

                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

According to this order, we should perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation first, then the Exponents (E) operation, followed by Multiplication/Division (M/D), and finally Addition/Subtraction (A/S) and Concatenation (C). However, in this given expression, we only have Prime Factor Counting, Addition, and Concatenation.

The Prime Factor Counting (F) operation, denoted as #, counts the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of the two numbers being operated on. In this case, 4 # 3. The prime factors of 4 are 2, 2, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3. Since there are no shared prime factors between the two numbers, the result of 4 # 3 is 0.

Next, we have the Addition (A) operation. So the result of 4 # 3 gets added to 2 as per the given expression.

Therefore,

4 # 3 + 2 = 0 + 2

The answer is **2**."

systemPrompt3_userPrompt2_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: For the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6, we must follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), and start by evaluating Prime Factor Counting (F).

1. Calculate 8 # 2:
Prime factors of 8 are 2 * 2 * 2, and prime factors of 2 are 2. We only care about unique prime factors, so there is 1 shared prime factor 2. Thus, 8 # 2 = 1

2. Calculate 6 # 6:
Prime factors of 6 are 2 * 3, and prime factors of 6 are 2 * 3, so there are 2 shared prime factors (2 and 3). Thus, 6 # 6 = 2

3. Now evaluate the Addition (A) part of the operation:
The expression becomes 1 + 2, and adding 1 and 2 yields 3.

Therefore,

The answer is 3."

systemPrompt3_userPrompt5_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: First, we need to evaluate the prime factorization of 3 and 2, since that operation comes before addition in the order of operations. The prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since they share no common prime factors, 3 # 2 = 0.

So, the problem simplifies to:

5 + 0

Since addition comes next in the order of operations, we evaluate that:

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

1. Identify the given mathematical operations and their placement in the order of operations. In this case, we have addition and concatenation.
2. According to PEFMDASC, we should perform calculations in the following order: Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division (left to right), Addition and Subtraction (left to right), and Concatenation (left to right). Since we don't have Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication, or Division in this expression, we skip to Addition and Concatenation.
3. Perform the concatenation operation first, as it comes before Addition in the order of operations.

5 + 2 @ 4
5 + 2 @ 42 (Concatenation: 2 and 4)

4. Now, perform the addition operation.

5 + 2 @ 42
7 @ 42 (Addition: 5 + 2)

5. Finally, there are no other operations left to perform, so the answer is the resulting value after concatenation.

Perform the Prime Factor Counting operation on 4 and 3:
4 # 3 = Count the shared prime factors between 4 and 3

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, whereas the prime factors of 3 are 3.
Since there are no shared prime factors, the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation results in 0.

Step 2: Addition (A)
Now, perform addition on the result of Step 1 and the number 2:
0 (step 1) + 2 = 2

                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)

                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

The expression given is: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

First, let's evaluate what's inside the parentheses due to the order of operations:

The expression now becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we calculate the Concatenation (C) operation as it comes before Addition and Subtraction in the order:

The expression becomes: 618 + 12 - 2 # 3

Now, we perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation:

The expression becomes: 618 + 12 - 2

Since there are no more operations other than Addition and Subtraction left, we follow the order from left to right:

First, we do 618 + 12 = 630

The expression now becomes: 630 - 2

Lastly, we perform the subtraction:

630 - 2 = 628

The answer is 628."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

1. Check for parentheses: There are no parentheses in this expression, so we can move on to the next step.
2. Calculate exponents: There are no exponents in this expression, so we can move on to the next step.
3. Perform prime factor counting (F): 3 # 2. First, let's find the prime factors of 3 and 2. The prime factors of 3 are 3, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since 2 is the only shared prime factor, the result of 3 # 2 is 1.
