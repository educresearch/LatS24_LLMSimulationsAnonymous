mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: According to the new order of operations, we should perform the operations from left to right in the following order: Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction, and Concatenation.

For the expression 5 + 2 @ 4, we first perform the Concatenation operation:

2 @ 4 = 24

Now the expression becomes:

5 + 24

Next, we perform Addition:

5 + 24 = 29

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new order of operations, we need to first perform the prime factor counting operation (F), then the addition (A).

8 # 2 = 2 (since the prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 2 are 2, so they share 1 prime factor, 2)

6 # 6 = 1 (since the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 6 are also 2 and 3, so they share 2 prime factors, 2 and 3)

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2, we need to follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), which means first perform prime factor counting, then exponents (none in this case), multiplication/division (none in this case), and finally addition/subtraction.

4 # 3 + 2
= 1 + 2 (since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and those of 3 are 3, and they share no common prime factor, so 4 # 3 equals 0. Adding 0 and 2 results in 2.)

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: First, we need to follow the order of operations (PEFMDASC) and evaluate the expression in parentheses:

6 @ (14 + 4) = 6 @ 18

Next, do the concatenation operation:

6 @ 18 = 618

Now, continue with the next step in the order of operations, which is the prime factor counting (F) operation:

618 # 3

To find the prime factors of 618 and 3, we have:
Prime factors of 618: 2, 3, 103
Prime factors of 3: 3

They share one prime factor, 3. So:

618 # 3 = 1

Finally, we move on to the addition and subtraction step in the order of operations, but in this example, we only have subtraction:

618 - 2

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Let's solve the expression step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations, where Concatenation (C) is the last operation to be performed.

The expression is: 5 + 2 @ 4

Step 1: Perform the Concatenation operation (C).
There are no exponents, parentheses, multiplication, division, prime factor counting, or addition to be performed first, so we proceed directly to the concatenation operation.

5 + 2 @ 4

3. Calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) for the second part: 6 # 6
4. Six has two unique prime factors, which are 2 and 3, and six also has two unique prime factors, which are 2 and 3. So, the shared prime factors are 2 and 3, and F(6, 6) = 2.

The expression: 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3

Following PEFMDASC, we first address the operation inside the parentheses:

14 + 4 = 18

Now the expression becomes: 6@18 + 12-2 # 3

Next, we evaluate the Concatenation operation (C):

6@18 = 68

Now the expression becomes: 68 + 12-2 # 3

We continue according to PEFMDASC and perform the Addition and Subtraction operations (A and S):

68 + 12 = 80
80 - 2 = 78

We evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operation (F):

78 has prime factors 2 and 3, and 3 has a prime factor of 3
