llama-2-70b-chat,1,700,systemPrompt4,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Sure, I can help you with that! Here's the step-by-step explanation using the PEFMDASC order:

1. P: Parentheses

There are no parentheses in this expression, so we can move on to the next step.

2. E: Exponents

There are no exponents in this expression, so we can move on to the next step.

3. F: Prime Factor Counting

We need to find the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 5 and 2.

5 # 2 = 5 # 2 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor is 1)

4 # 5 = 4 # 5 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor is 1)

So, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 1.

4. M/D: Multiplication and Division (left to right)

There are no multiplication or division operations in this expression, so we can move on to the next step.

5. A/S: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)

We need to add 5 and 2.
