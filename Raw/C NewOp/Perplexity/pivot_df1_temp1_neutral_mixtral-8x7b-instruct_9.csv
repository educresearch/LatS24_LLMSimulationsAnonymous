mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we follow the new order of operations PEFMDASC.

8 # 2: We first find the prime factors of 8 and 2. The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and the prime factor of 2 is 2. They share one prime factor (2), so 8 # 2 = 1.

6 # 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 6 are also 2 and 3. They share two prime factors (2 and 3), so 6 # 6 = 2.

8 # 2 + 6 # 6: Now we perform addition. So, 1 + 2 = 3.

The answer is 3."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC). According to this order, we first perform prime factor counting (F), then addition or subtraction (A), and finally concatenation (C).

So, for the given problem:

4 # 3 + 2

We start by performing prime factor counting on 4 and 3.

Both 4 and 3 have only one shared prime factor, which is 2. So, 4 # 3 = 1.

Next, we perform addition on the result of prime factor counting and the number 2.

1 + 2 = 3.

Finally, we don't need to perform concatenation as there are no numbers left to apply the concatenation operation to.

Therefore, the answer is 3."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: Let's break down the expression using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. Parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18
2. Prime Factor Counting: since there are no shared prime factors between 6 and 18, # operation results in 0.
3. Concatenation: 6 @ 18 = 618
4. Addition and Subtraction: now we proceed from left to right with the operations + and -.
   618 + 12 - 2 # 3 = 630 - 2 # 3 (since # operation takes precedence over -)
   = 630 - 2 # 3 = 628 # 3 (since # operation takes precedence over -)
   = 628 # 3 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor is 2)

Hence, the final answer is:

The answer is 628 - 1 = 627."

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC). According to this order, we should perform Prime Factor Counting (F) before Addition and Subtraction (A/S).

First, calculate 8 # 2:

8 # 2 = number of shared prime factors of 8 and 2
8 = 2^3 and 2 = 2^1
There is only one shared prime factor, which is 2. So, 8 # 2 = 1

Next, calculate 6 # 6:

6 # 6 = number of shared prime factors of 6 and 6
6 = 2 * 3 and 6 = 2 * 3
There are two shared prime factors, which are 2 and 3. So, 6 # 6 = 2

Finally, perform Addition (A):

8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt2,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow these steps:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we perform concatenation (C) as it comes before addition and subtraction in the order of operations:

618 + 12 - 2 # 3

Now, we do addition and subtraction (A/S) from left to right:

630 - 2 # 3

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: For the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6, we need to follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, in which Prime Factor Counting (F) comes before Addition and Subtraction (A/S).

First, let's calculate the Prime Factor Counting for the two operands on the left side of the expression, 8 and 2. 

The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 2 are just 2. Since they share one prime factor, 8 # 2 = 1.

Next, let's calculate the Prime Factor Counting for the two operands on the right side of the expression, 6 and 6.

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and again the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. These two numbers share two prime factors, so 6 # 6 = 2.

Now, we have 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 2, which is equal to 3.

The answer is 3."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt3,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, according to the new order of operations, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) before the addition (A). The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since they have no common prime factor, 4 # 3 equals 0.

Next, add 2 to the result of the prime factor counting.

The answer is 0 + 2.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Let's calculate the expression step by step, following the revised order of operations: PEFMDASC.

1. There are no parentheses or exponents in this expression, so we move on.
2. There is no prime factor counting (F) operation in this expression, so we continue.
3. There are no multiplication or division operations in this expression, so we move on.
4. We now perform the concatenation (C) operation: 2 @ 4 = 24, as we need to join the digits of 2 and 4 together.
5. We now have a new expression to evaluate: 5 + 24.
6. Perform the addition (A) operation: 5 + 24 = 29.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: Step 1: Calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) of the first pair of numbers, 8 and 2.
The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and the prime factor of 2 is 2. Since they share one prime factor (2), the result of 8 # 2 is 1.

Step 2: Perform the addition.
1 + 6 (since 6 # 6 = 1)

Step 3: Perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) of the second pair of numbers, which is not necessary in this case because the addition has already been done. But if we were to follow the original order, the result would be 1 because 6 has one unique prime factor (2).

Step 4: Perform the addition.

4 # 3 + 2

First, let's calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) for 4 and 3:
4 # 3 = 1 (since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and for 3 it is 3, so they share no prime factors)

Now, we have:

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,systemPrompt4,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: Let's go through this step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. There are no parentheses or exponents, so we move on to Prime Factor counting (F). However, there are no instances of the prime factor counting operation (#) in the expression.

2. Next in line is Multiplication and Division (M/D), but there are no multiplication or division operations in the expression either.

3. We then come to Addition and Subtraction (A/S). We see here the addition operation (+): 5 + 3.

   Perform the addition: 5 + 3 = 8

   The expression now becomes: 8 # 2

4. Again, we look for the prime factor counting operation (#). It's present in the expression, so we perform it:

   Since the prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 2 are 2, there's one shared prime factor (2), so 8 # 2 = 1.

So, after performing all operations in the PEFMDASC order, we get:
