1. Parentheses: Since there are no parentheses in the expression, we move to the next operation.
2. Exponents: None present, so we move to the next operation.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We don't have two numbers to count the shared prime factors between, so we move to the next operation.
4. Multiplication and Division (MD): None present, so we move to the next operation.
5. Addition and Subtraction (AS): We have the addition sign '+' followed by the concatenation operation '@' and the number '2' and '4'.
6. Concatenation (C): To evaluate concatenation, we join the digits of the two numbers: 2 and 4. So, 2@4 = 24
7. Addition: Now, we add the result of step 5 to the initial number '5'.

Now, we perform Prime Factor Counting (F):

a) 8 # 2 = 2 (since 2 is the only prime factor both numbers have)
b) 2 # 6 = 1 (only one prime factor, 2, is common to both 2 and 6)

So, after performing Prime Factor Counting (F), we have: 2 + 1 = 3

Now, we perform multiplication and division (M and D): There are no multiplication/division symbols present, so we skip this step.

Next comes addition and subtraction (AS): We combine the numbers after evaluating Prime Factor Counting.

1. Parentheses: Solve the expression inside the parentheses, i.e., 14 + 4 = 18.
2. Exponents: None given.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We need to find the count of unique prime factors shared by |6| and |18| and |18| and |3|.
   The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
   The prime factors of 18 are 2, 2, 3, and 3.
   The prime factors of 3 are 3.
   Since there is only one shared prime factor, 3, between |6| and |18| and between |18| and |3|, we have: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 = F # A # M # S # C

4. Multiplication and Division (M & D): None given in the sequence.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A & S): Perform addition and subtraction from left to right, but we need to find the result of prime factor counting operation first, which was defined as F.

6. Concatenation (C): Perform concatenation operations left to right as needed.

Given expressions: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

First, perform the given operations inside the parentheses:
14 + 4 = 18

Now, evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operation (F):
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
The prime factors of 18 are 2, 2, 3, and 3.
The prime factors of 3 are 3.
Thus, there is one shared prime factor between |6| and |18| and between |18| and |3|, i.e., 3.

Now, evaluate the sequence according to the new order of operations:

F # A # M # S # C

1. F = 1 (Since we have found the prime factor count, which was defined as F.)
2. A:
   6 @ 18 (Replace F with 1) = 6 @ 18 = 618

   12 - 2 (Replace F with 1) = 10

   A = 618 + 10 = 628

3. M: None given
4. S:

Prime factor counting (#) comes before all other operations, as shown in the order of operations.

So we start by finding the prime factor counts of the numbers 8 and 2, and 6 and 6.

 For 8, the prime factors are 2 and 2 and 2, so the count is 3.
 For 2, the prime factor is 2, so the count is 1.
 For 6, the prime factors are 2 and 2 and 3, so the count is 3.
 For 6, the prime factors are 2 and 2 and 3, so the count is 3.

Since there is only one operation (#) in this problem, the count of prime factors is the result of the first operation.

The result of the first operation is 3 (since the prime factor counts of 8 and 2 are 3 and 1 respectively, and since there is only one # symbol in the equation).

Since addition (A/S) comes before concatenation (C), we next perform the addition part of the problem, 3 + 6.

The result of addition is 9.

Finally, since concatenation comes last, we concatenate the results of the previous operations, 3 and 9.

systemPrompt3_userPrompt1_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 2 @ 4, we need to follow the updated order of operations: PEFMDASC.

First, we handle the parentheses (if there were any): none in this expression.

Next, we do the exponentiation (if present): none in this expression.

Then, we perform Prime Factor Counting (#): 5 has a prime factor of 5, and 4 has prime factors of 2 and 2. So the expression 5 # 4 equals 2 (two shared prime factors).

Now we come to Multiplication and Division (M/D): none in this expression.

Next up is Addition and Subtraction (A/S): 5 is an addend, and we have 2@4. Since we need to perform concatenation before addition:

We evaluate the concatenation operation (C): the digits of 2 and 4 are concatenated to give 24. So, 2 @ 4 = 24.

Finally, we perform the addition operation (A): 5 + 24 = 29.

Putting it all together, following the PEFMDASC order, we get:

5 + 2 @ 4 = 5 + 24 = 29.

The answer is 29."

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses, so we move on to the next operation.
2. Exponents: We don't have any exponents, so we move on to the next operation.
3. Prime Factor Counting (#): We have this operation between two numbers (2 and 8), so we will perform this operation first:

The prime factors of 2 are 2, while the prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2. Since both numbers have the same prime factor (2), we get a count of 1.

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): We have # operator between two numbers, which is not a multiplication or division operator. So, we move on to the next operation.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We have @ operator between 6 and the result of # operation between 8 and 2. Since the order of operations is left to right, we will perform the addition before the concatenation:

To find the sum of the results of # operation and 6, we get:
The result of # operation between 8 and 2 = 1
Hence, Sum = 1 + 6 = 7.

6. Concatenation (C): We have the @ operator between the result of the addition and the number 6. So, we will perform the concatenation:

Concatenation of 7 and 6 = 76

systemPrompt4_userPrompt3_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the revised order of operations PEFMDASC, follow these steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Calculate the prime factor count of 4 and 3.
   Since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3, there is no common prime factor, so the prime factor count is 0.

2. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Perform the addition operation.
   Since the prime factor count was 0, there is no change in the value, so the expression remains 4 # 3 + 2 = 4.

However, it is important to note that since the prime factor count operation did not change the value of the expression, it is unnecessary in this particular expression. Technically, the problem becomes 4 + 2 = 6, but since there is no need to use the new operations or the updated order of operations in this case, it is simpler to just perform the addition directly.

When solving more complex expressions that involve the new mathematical operations, make sure to follow the correct order: Parentheses (P) > Exponents (E) > Prime Factor Counting (F) > Multiplication and Division (M/D) > Addition and Subtraction (A/S) > Concatenation (C). This will ensure that the problem is solved correctly according to the new rules."

1. Parentheses: Solve the expression inside the parentheses first, which is 14 + 4.

   = 6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Exponents: None, so we move to the next operation.

3. Prime Factor Counting:

   a) For 18 and 6, no common prime factors. So, the answer is 0.
   b) For 18 and 3, the prime factors of 18 are 2, 3, and 3. The prime factors of 3 are 3. Since there is only one 3, the answer is 1.
   c) For 6 and 2, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. The prime factors of 2 are 2. Since both numbers share only one prime factor, the answer is 1.

4. Multiplication and Division (from left to right):

   a) Multiply 6 @ 18: With new operations coming before addition or subtraction, we first concatenate 6 and 1 (result is 61) and then concatenate 61 and 18. The final result is 6118.
   b) Perform prime factor counting with this result and 3, which we calculated as having a result of 1 earlier. We examined their absolute values, so we take the absolute value of the result, which is 1.

   = 6118 + 1

5. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right): Since there's an addition and a subtraction, we'll solve the addition first:

   = (6118 + 12) - 2

6. Subtraction: Now we can perform the subtraction:

   = 6130 - 2

7. Concatenation: The original expression did not include concatenation with numbers, so in this case, there's no use for it. Thus, the answer is with no concatenation and is 6128.

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 6128."

1. Prime Factor counting (F): Since there are no parentheses or exponents, we immediately proceed to prime factor counting. In this given expression, the operands are all positive. So, we calculate the common prime factors of each pair of numbers and determine the count of unique prime factors shared between them.

a = 3
b = 2

Prime factors of a (3): 3
Prime factors of b (2): 2
No common prime factors between them.

Thus, 3 # 2 = 0.

However, the issue here is the presence of addition sign (+) in between the numbers. According to the order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to perform prime factor counting before addition. But since in this case prime factor counting results in 0, the original expression remains unchanged. In the following steps, we proceed with the addition.

2. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Since there are only additions in the given expression, we proceed with evaluating the addition. Following the left to right rule, we add 3 and then 2.

3 + 2 = 5

So, the given expression (5 + 3 # 2) when evaluated according to the PEFMDASC order does not yield a different result as a result of the Prime factor counting step.
