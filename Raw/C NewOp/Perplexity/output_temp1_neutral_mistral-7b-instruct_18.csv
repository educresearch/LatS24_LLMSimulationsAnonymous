Since there are no parentheses or exponents, we start with prime factor counting (F). 

I. Prime Factor Counting:
- Prime factors of 4: 2, 2
- Prime factors of 3: 3

However, since there is no shared prime factor, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 0.

Now, since we have only addition and concatenation operations left, we evaluate them from left to right as per the given order.

II. Addition:
Since there is only one addition operation and it comes before concatenation, we perform it next.

First, we have 0 (the result of prime factor counting) and 2, so we simply add them:

0 + 2 = 2

III. Concatenation:
Finally, we have the result of the addition operation, 2, and the originating numbers, 4 and 3. We perform concatenation by joining their digits at a digit level:

2 @ 4 @ 3 = 243

systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: First, we need to follow the expanded order of operations, PEFMDASC:

1. Parentheses: Solve the expression within the parentheses first, i.e., 14 + 4 = 18.
2. Prime Factor Counting: Since we have no negative numbers or variables in this problem, we can skip this step for now.
3. Exponents: There are no exponents in this problem, so we can skip this step as well.
4. Multiplication and Division (L to R): We have only addition and concatenation operations, no multiplication or division, so we can skip this step.
5. Addition and Subtraction (L to R): We have addition and concatenation, working from left to right, starting with addition:

6 @ (14 + 4)
= 6 @ 18 (since 14 + 4 = 18)

We cannot evaluate this problem further without the concatenation operation rules. Based on the given examples, we should concatenate the digits of the absolute values of the given numbers first. Thus,

6 @ 18
= 618

So, the final answer, in the given format, is:

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): 
Since we have only two digits, we don't need to calculate prime factors, as the number of unique prime factors is already 0 for each single-digit number. In this case, 4 and 3 both have no shared prime factors. So, 4 # 3 = 0.
2. Concatenation (C): 
Now, we apply the concatenation operation, which joins the digits of the absolute values of 4 and 3: 0 and 3 respectively. Since concatenation is left to right, the final result is 03.

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
  The prime factors of |8| are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of |2| are 2. Since they have a common prime factor 2, the prime factor counting operation (#) is 1.

2. Concatenation (C):
  Concatenating the results of the prime factor counting (F) step, we get 8 and 2. The result of the Concatenation operation (C) is 82.

3. Multiplication and Division (M):
  We don't have any multiplication or division operations in this problem, so we move on to the next operation.

4. Addition and Subtraction (A):
  We have 6 # 6 as a separate addition and subtraction group. Let's apply the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation:
  The prime factors of |6| are 2 and 3. The prime factors of |6| are also 2 and 3, so the prime factor counting operation (#) is 2.

5. Concatenation (C):
  Concatenating the results of the prime factor counting (F) step for the sub-problem 6 # 6, we get 6 and 6. So, the result of the Concatenation operation (C) is 66.

6. Addition and Subtraction (A):
  So far we have the results of the Prime Factor Counting operations for the main problem 8 # 2 and the sub-problem 6 # 6. Now, we apply the Addition (A) operation:
  The result of the Addition operation (A) is 82 + 66 = 148.

Therefore, the answer is 148."

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses, so we move to the next operation.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents, so we move to the next operation.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): The symbols involved do not have absolute values or negative signs, so we have prime factor counting 0 for all numbers.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There are no multiplication or division symbols, so we move to the next operation.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Since this problem contains only addition operation, we perform addition. 

Given expression: 4 # 3 + 2

Since prime factor counting is 0 in this case, we just apply the order of operations as follows:

Addition (A/S) is the only operation, so we perform it from left to right.

First, we add 2 to 4 (which is 3). So, 3 is the first summand: 3.

Then, we concatenate the result with 3: 3 + 3 = 6.

However, we made a mistake in the initial order because concatenation should be performed before addition. Thus, we need to adjust the calculated answer accordingly.

To get the correct answer, we need to perform concatenation first, and since it is 0 for the given numbers (as explained in the prime factor counting examples), we don't change the calculated answer of 6 using addition.

systemPrompt3_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated mathematical operations and order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to identify which operations to perform first. In this case, we see that there is no need for parentheses, exponents, or prime factor counting. So we move on to multiplication and division (MD), then addition and subtraction (AS), and finally concatenation (C).

However, since there is no multiplication or division present, we proceed directly to addition and subtraction (AS). In this particular expression, there are no subtractions, only addition and the # operator (prime factor counting), which comes after addition in the updated order of operations. So, the correct sequence of operations is as follows:

1. 3 # 2 (prime factor counting) = 1 (since the prime factors of 3 and 2 have no common prime factors)
2. Add 3 and the result of the prime factor counting, i.e., add 3 and 1.

Hence, the answer is:

The answer is 4."

The absolute values of a and b are |8| = 8 and |2| = 2.

1. Prime Factor Counting: Since we are counting the number of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of the given numbers, let's find the prime factors for each number first:
   Prime factors of 4: 2, 2
   Prime factors of 3: 3
   Since there are no common prime factors, the prime factor count is 0.

2. Multiplication and Division (from left to right): There is no need for multiplication or division in this expression.

3. Exponents: None.

4. Concatenation: Since concatenation (denoted as @) is one of the new operations, let's evaluate it next:
   There are no parentheses or other operations to consider. So, we simply join the digits of the given numbers:
   4 @ 3 = 43

5. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right):
   Here, we have the number 43, which is the result of step 4 concatenation, and 2:

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.
