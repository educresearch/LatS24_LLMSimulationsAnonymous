systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression with the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to apply the rules for parentheses, exponents, prime factor counting, multiplication and division, addition and subtraction, and finally concatenation.

1. Parentheses:
The expression has parentheses, so we need to calculate what is inside first:

(14 + 4)
18

2. Prime factor counting:
Since we have a prime factor counting operation (#) before an addition (+), we need to evaluate prime factor counting before addition:

6 @ 18 # 3
No shared prime factors between 6 and 18, so the result is 0.

3. Concatenation:
Now we have a concatenation (@) operation before a subtraction (-), so we need to evaluate concatenation before subtraction:

6 @ 18 = 618

4. Subtraction:
Now we have a subtraction (-) operation, so we need to calculate this:

618 - 2
616

5. Addition:
Lastly, we need to evaluate the addition (+) operation:

616 + 12
628

The answer is 628."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

   - Since 8's prime factors are 2³, 2, and 2, and 2's prime factors are 2, there is one shared prime factor, 2. So 8 # 2 = 1.

First, let's calculate 4#3:
Since the prime factorization of 4 is 2² and 2, which is shared with 3, having prime factors 2 and 3, there is only 1 unique shared prime factor, i.e., the prime factor counting operation results in 1.

So, the expression 4#3 equals 1.

systemPrompt3_userPrompt2_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the problem using the new operations and updated order of operations, we first need to apply the prime factor counting operation (#), followed by addition and concatenation as indicated in the updated order of operations PEFMDASC.

Given expression: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Step 1: Find the prime factor count for each number.

The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, so 8 # 2 = 1 (since they have only one common prime factor: 2).

The prime factors of 2 are 2 (since 2 is a prime number).

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, so 6 # 6 = 2 (since they have a common prime factor: 2).

Step 2: Apply the addition operation before concatenation.

1 + 2 = 3

Step 3: Perform the concatenation operation.

So, 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 (from prime factor counting) + 3 (from addition) = 4, but since we need to perform concatenation in the end, we need to combine the digits 1 and 4 to get the final answer: 14.

The answer is 14."

systemPrompt3_userPrompt3_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: Given operation: 4 # 3 + 2

Explanation:

1. Prime Factor Counting (#):
   Since we are performing the prime factor counting operation first, we need to find the common prime factors of |4| = 2²² and |3| = 3. Since the prime factors of 4 are 2²² and the prime factors of 3 are 3, there is no common prime factor, so the result of the prime factor counting is 0.

2. Addition (A):
   Now, we move on to the addition operation (+). We add the result of the prime factor counting (0) and the second number, which is 2. So, the result of this step is 2.

3. Concatenation (C):
   Since we still have one more operation left to perform, which is concatenation (@), we need to evaluate the sum (2) before concatenating it with the first number (4). But in this case, since there are no more mathematical operations left, we don't need to perform concatenation at all.

In summary, since there was no need to concatenate in the given problem, our final answer does not involve any concatenation operation. Therefore, the answer is 2.

The answer is 2."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt3_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
We need to find the prime factor count of 4 and 3.
The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
The prime factors of 3 are 3.
Since there is no shared prime factor, the prime factor count is 0.

Step 2: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
0 (from the result of prime factor counting) + 2
The answer is 2."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mistral-7b-instruct,1,700,assistant,"GPT Response: Step 1: Solve the expression inside the parentheses (14 + 4) using the order of operations PEFMDASC. Since parentheses have the highest precedence, we will start by evaluating it:

(14 + 4) = 18

Step 2: Now that we have the value of the expression inside the parentheses, we can concatenate the result (18) with 6 according to the updated order of operations:

6 @ 18 = 186

Step 3: Next, we need to do the addition and subtraction in the expression using the PEFMDASC order:

The expression contains only one addition (+) and one subtraction (-). The addition should be performed before the subtraction according to the updated order of operations (M/D > A/S):

186 + 12 = 198

Step 4: Finally, we need to perform the prime factor counting operation (#):

198 # 3 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor in the absolute values of 198 and 3 is 2, but since both numbers are positive, only one count is considered).

Step 5: Putting it all together, we have:

The answer is 1981."
