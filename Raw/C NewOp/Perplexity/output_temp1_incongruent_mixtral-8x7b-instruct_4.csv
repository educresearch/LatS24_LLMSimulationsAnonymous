systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken700,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,700,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

In this expression, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we move on to the next operation in the order, which is F for Prime Factor Counting. However, there is no prime factor counting operation in this expression, so we can skip it and move on to the next operation in the order, which is M/D for Multiplication and Division (left to right). But there are no multiplication or division operations in this expression either, so we can skip it as well.

The next operation in the order is A/S for Addition and Subtraction (left to right), which includes the addition operation in our expression. Therefore, we evaluate the addition first, yielding:

According to this order, Prime Factor Counting (F) should be performed before Addition and Subtraction (A/S). So, we first calculate the Prime Factor Counting operations separately:

8 # 2 = 8 and 2 share one prime factor, which is 2. So, 8 # 2 = 1.

6 # 6 = Both 6 and 6 are multiples of the same prime factor, which is 2. Therefore, 6 # 6 = 1.

After performing the Prime Factor Counting operations, we get:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 1

Now, we proceed with the Addition part, which is in the A/S category of the order of operations.

The expression is simplified as follows:

1 + 1 = 2

Therefore, the answer is 2."

The expression is: 5 + 2@4

Step 1: Parentheses ()
There are no parentheses in this expression, so we can move on to the next step.

Step 2: Exponents (to the power of)
There are no exponents in this expression, so we can move on to the next step.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Prime factor counting (denoted by #) is before addition in the order of operations, so we need to calculate any instances of it before adding. However, there is no prime factor counting in this expression.

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M and D) (left to right)
There are no multiplication or division in this expression.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A and S) (left to right)
Now we can move on to addition and subtraction. There is addition and concatenation in this expression, but since addition comes before concatenation in the order of operations, we should perform the addition first.

5 + 2@4
= 5 + (2 concatenated with 4)
= 5 + 24 (since 2@4 = 24, which is the concatenation of 2 and 4)

Step 6: Concatenation (C) (left to right)
There is only one instance of concatenation in this expression, which we performed in the previous step.

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 29."

1. Parentheses: Calculate the expression inside the parentheses first, 14 + 4 = 18.
So, now we have 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3.
2. Prime Factor Counting (F): Next, we perform the Prime Factor counting operation between 2 and 3 since it's next in the order of operations, which is 0 as there are no shared prime factors.
So, now we have 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0.
3. Concatenation (C): Now, perform the Concatenation operation as it's next in order, which is 6 @ 18 = 618.
So, now we have 618 + 12 - 0.
4. Addition: Perform the addition operation, which is 618 + 12 = 630.
So, now we have 630 - 0.
5. Subtraction: Finally, perform the subtraction operation, which is 630 - 0 = 630.

The answer is 630."
