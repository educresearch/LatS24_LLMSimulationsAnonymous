6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Then, perform the Prime Factor Counting operation:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

THEN, perform Subtraction:

6 @ 30 - 1

6 @ 29

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

The equation is ""4 # 3 + 2"". 

Step 1 (Prime factor counting): The number of unique prime factors common to both 4 and 3 need to be determined. We find that the prime factors of 4 are (2) and those of 3 are (3). In this case, there are no common prime factors. So, 4 # 3 = 0. 

Substitute 4 # 3 to 0 and the new equation is: 0 + 2

Step 2 (Addition): We add 0 and 2, getting a result of 2.

So, 4 # 3 + 2 = 2.

The prime factors of 8 are 2, meanwhile, the prime factors of 2 are 2. They have 1 common unique prime factor, i.e., 2. Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1.

Similarly, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. They have 1 unique prime factor which is 2. So, 6 # 6 = 1.

The original expression then simplifies to 1 + 1 based on these calculations.

The provided expression is 5 + 3 # 2. 

According to PEFMDASC, we should perform Prime Factor Counting (F) before addition (A). 

So we find the shared prime factors of 3 and 2. The prime factors of 3 are {3} and for 2 are {2}, respectively. 

Given that there are no shared prime factors, the output of 3 # 2 is 0.

So, the problem simplifies to 5 + 0.

Then we conduct the addition to get the final output.

The answer is 5."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b.

                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

Here, the only operations present are addition (A) and concatenation (C). According to PEFMDASC, addition is done before concatenation. So you must first perform addition:

5 + 2 = 7

You can then replace the value of 5 + 2 in the original equation:
 
7 @ 4 

Then, concatentate 7 and 4:

7 @ 4 = 74

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Let's solve this problem using the order of operations PEFMDASC.

Given expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1 (Parentheses):
We start with the expression within the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18. So the expression simplifies to:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2 (Exponents):
There are no exponents so we skip this step.

Step 3 (Prime Factor Counting - 'F'):
Using prime factor counting, we find the shared prime factors between |2| and |3|. Since they are both prime and different, they share no prime factors, so 2 # 3 = 0.

Our expression is now:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4 (Multiplication and Division - 'M'/'D'):
No multiplication or division in the expression, so we skip this step.

Step 5 (Addition and Subtraction - 'A'/'S'):
We will conduct the addition and subtraction from left to right: 

(6 @ 18) + 12 - 0 = 618 + 12
618 + 12 = 630

So now we have :

630 - 0 = 630

Our expression is now:
630

Step 6 (Concatenation - 'C'):
There are no concatenations left to perform.

The answer is 630."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b.

                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)

So, let's perform Prime Factor Counting (#) operation first.

* Prime Factor Counting (3 # 2): Both 3 and 2 are prime numbers, but they are different primes, so they have no shared factors. This means that 3 # 2 equals 0.

Substitute this value back into our expression. We get 5 + 0.
