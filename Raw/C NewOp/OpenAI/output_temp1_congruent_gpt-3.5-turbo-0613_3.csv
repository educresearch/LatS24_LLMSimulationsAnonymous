6#6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Therefore, the shared prime factors between 6 and 6 is 2 and 3.

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

Step 2: Exponents
There are no exponents in the expression, so we move on to the next step.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting
Next, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation:
6#18 = 1
Since the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 18 are 2 and 3, they have one common prime factor - 2.

The expression becomes:

First, we have the parentheses operation (P), but there are no parentheses in the expression.

Then, we move on to exponents (E), but there are no exponents in the expression.

Next, we have prime factor counting (F). In this case, we have 3 and 2 as the numbers to evaluate. The prime factors of 3 are 3, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Therefore, there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, resulting in a prime factor count of 0.

Moving on to multiplication and division (M/D), again we don't have any multiplication or division in the expression.

After that, we have addition and subtraction (A/S). Now we can calculate 5 + 0 since the prime factor count is 0. This equals 5.

Finally, we have the concatenation operation (C), but there are no more numbers or operations to perform after the addition.

Therefore, the final answer is 5."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.
                    It's crucial to get this right for accurate calculations.

Step 1: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first
       14 + 4 = 18

Now the expression becomes: 6@(18) + 12 - 2  #  3

Step 2: Evaluate the concatenation (C) operation
       6@(18) = 618

Now the expression becomes: 618 + 12 - 2  #  3

Step 3: Evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation
       18 # 3 = 1
       (since prime factors of 18 are 2 and 3, and prime factors of 3 are only 3. Therefore, there is 1 shared prime factor between 18 and 3)

Now the expression becomes: 618 + 12 - 2  #  1

Step 4: Evaluate the addition (A) operation
       618 + 12 = 630

Now the expression becomes: 630 - 2  #  1

Step 5: Evaluate the subtraction (S) operation
       630 - 2 = 628

Now the expression becomes: 628 # 1

Step 6: Evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation
       628 # 1 = 1
       (since prime factors of 628 are 2 and 157, and prime factors of 1 are only 1. Therefore, there is 1 shared prime factor between 628 and 1)

The answer is 1."
