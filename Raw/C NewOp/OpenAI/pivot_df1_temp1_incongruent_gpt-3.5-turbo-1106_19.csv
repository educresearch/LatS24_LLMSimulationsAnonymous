gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression ""5+3 # 2"" according to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we must first evaluate any operations within parentheses. However, there are no parentheses in the given expression.

Next, we look for any exponents, but there are none in the expression.

Moving on, we apply the prime factor counting operation (#) before addition according to the updated order of operations. 

The prime factorization of the absolute values of the numbers involved are as follows:
- The absolute value of 5 is 5 (and 5 has only 1 prime factor, which is 5).
- The absolute value of 3 is 3 (and 3 has only 1 prime factor, which is 3).
- The absolute value of 2 is 2 (and 2 has only 1 prime factor, which is 2).

So, 5 # 3 = 0 because there are no shared prime factors between 5 and 3.

Therefore, the expression simplifies to 5 + 0.

Finally, we perform the addition, which gives us the result:
5 + 0 = 5.
