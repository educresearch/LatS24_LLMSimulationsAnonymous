gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve the problem ""8#2 + 6#6"" with the new operation definitions and order of operations PEFMDASC, follow these steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Evaluate any prime factor counting operations before moving on to other types of operations.

For 8#2:
- The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (2^3).
- The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
- Since 2 is the common prime factor, the prime factor counting for 8#2 results in 1.

For 6#6:
- The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. 
- As both numbers are the same, the shared prime factors will correspond to all prime factors of 6 without duplicates.
- This means the prime factor counting for 6#6 is 2 (as there are two unique prime factors, 2 and 3).

2. Add the results:
After doing the prime factor counting for both sets of numbers, we simply add the results:

8#2 + 6#6
= 1 + 2
= 3

So the final answer to the problem ""8#2 + 6#6"" is:

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we will apply the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

4 # 3 + 2

Let's break this down step by step:

1. (P) Parentheses: There are no parentheses in the expression.
2. (E) Exponents: There are no exponents in the expression.
3. (F) Prime Factor counting: First, we will evaluate 4 # 3.
    - The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (i.e., 2 squared).
    - The prime factors of 3 are 3.
    - 4 # 3 represents the count of unique prime factors shared by 4 and 3.
    - Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, the result is 0.
    - Thus, 4 # 3 = 0.
4. (M) Multiplication: There is no multiplication to perform.
5. (D) Division: There is no division to perform.
6. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R): Now, we will perform the addition.
    - 0 + 2 = 2.
7. (C) Concatenation (L to R): There is no concatenation to perform.

After evaluating the prime factor counting operation, we proceed with the addition:

4 # 3 + 2
= 0 + 2
= 2

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: Let's solve the given mathematics problem step by step, following the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

The given expression is: 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3

First, we handle operations inside parentheses (P):
14 + 4 = 18

So the expression becomes:
6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we handle the prime factor counting (F):
2 # 3 = 0 (since 2 and 3 do not have common prime factors)

Now the expression looks like:
6@18 + 12 - 0

There are no exponents (E) to resolve.

Moving on to multiplication (M) and division (D), there aren't any terms that need to be multiplied or divided.

Next, we perform addition (A) and subtraction (S):
12 - 0 = 12

Now the expression is:
6@18 + 12

We finally evaluate concatenation (C):
6 @ 18 = 618

The last step is to add (A) the concatenation result to 12:
618 + 12 = 630

Therefore, the answer is 630."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we have to apply the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

The expression is 5 + 3 # 2.

Although normally we would perform addition before prime factor counting according to the conventional PEMDAS, in the new order of operations, Prime Factor counting (F) comes before Addition (A). Therefore, we must perform the prime factor counting operation first.

Let's evaluate 3 # 2:

- The prime factors of 3 are just 3 because it is a prime number.
- The prime factors of 2 are just 2 because it is also a prime number.

Since there are no common prime factors between 3 and 2, 3 # 2 equals 0.

Now we can compute the addition:

5 + 3 # 2
= 5 + 0
= 5

The answer is 5."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem, we must adhere to the new order of operations: PEFMDASC (Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction, Concatenation).

The problem is:

5 + 2 @ 4

Following the updated order of operations, we perform concatenation last, after addition. Therefore, first, we do the addition, then the concatenation:

5 + 2 = 7

Now that we have the sum, we concatenate it with 4:

7 @ 4

The concatenation of 7 and 4 is simply joining the digits together:

7 @ 4 = 74

Thus, the final answer is:

The answer is 74."

For the first term, 8 # 2:
- The prime factor of 8 is 2 (since 8 = 2^3)
- The prime factor of 2 is 2
The number of shared unique prime factors is 1 (which is the prime factor 2).

For the second term, 6 # 6:
- The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3
- The prime factors of 6 are the same: 2 and 3
The number of shared unique prime factors is 2 (which are the prime factors 2 and 3).

Given expression: 6@(14+4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
First, we evaluate the expression inside parentheses:

14 + 4 = 18

Now the expression becomes: 6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents to evaluate.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Now we evaluate the prime factor counting:

2 # 3 = 0 (since 2 has 2 as a prime factor, and 3 has 3, no shared prime factors)

Now the expression becomes: 6@18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication/Division (M/D)
There are no multiplication or division operations to perform.

Step 5: Addition/Subtraction (A/S)
We perform the addition and subtraction left to right:

12 - 0 = 12

Now the expression becomes: 6@18 + 12

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
Now we perform the concatenation left to right:

6@18 = 618 (Concatenating the digits of 6 and 18)

Finally, we add the result of the concatenation to 12:

618 + 12 = 630

The final answer is 630."

The prime factors of 3 are 3 itself, and the prime factors of 2 are 2 itself. As there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, the result of 3 # 2 is 0.

The problem then becomes:

5 + (3 # 2)
5 + 0

8#2 + 6#6

First, follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC. So, we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) before moving onto Addition (A).

8#2: 
The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (2^3). 
The prime factors of 2 are just 2. 
The unique common prime factor between 8 and 2 is 2. So, 8#2 is the count of unique shared prime factors, which is just 1 (factor of 2).

6#6:
Both numbers are the same, and the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. 
The unique common prime factors between these two numbers are the same as the prime factors of 6 itself, which are 2 and 3. 
However, since we are counting the number of unique prime factors shared, and in this case, all prime factors of 6 are shared with itself, we count each prime factor once. Therefore, 6#6 is equal to 2 (factors of 2 and 3).

Now we can perform the addition:

The ""#"" operation, Prime Factor Counting, comes before addition according to the updated order of operations. First, we need to find the common unique prime factors between 4 and 3. The prime factors of 4 are 2 (as 4 = 2^2), and the prime factors of 3 are just 3 itself (as 3 is a prime number). There are no common prime factors, so:

4 # 3 = 0

First, handle the parentheses (P):

\(6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3\)

Next, we deal with the prime factor counting (F):

\(6@18 + 12 - (2 # 3)\)
\(2\) and \(3\) share a common prime factor which is \(3\) itself. So:

\(6@18 + 12 - 1\)

Next, handle the addition and subtraction (A/S), going from left to right:

\(6@18 + 12 - 1\)
\(18 + 12 = 30\)

\(6@30 - 1\)
\(6@30 = 630\) since concatenation is simply combining digits.

- The prime factors of 2 are just 2.

Since the only prime factor 2 is shared, the count for 8#2 is 1.

Next, for 6#6:

- The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
- Since we're comparing 6 to itself, all prime factors are shared.

The count is the number of unique prime factors, which for the number 6 are 2 and 3. Therefore, the count for 6#6 is 2.

5. Addition/Subtraction (A/S) from left to right
6. Concatenation (C) from left to right

Here's the given expression: \(6@(14 + 4) + 12 - 2 \# 3\)

Let's break it down step by step:

Step 1: Parentheses
Solve the expression within the parentheses first:
\(14 + 4 = 18\)

Now the expression looks like this:
\(6@18 + 12 - 2 \# 3\)

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting
Next, we evaluate the prime factor counting between 2 and 3:
Prime factors of 2 are \(2\).
Prime factors of 3 are \(3\).
There are no shared prime factors, so:
\(2 \# 3 = 0\)

The expression is now:
\(6@18 + 12 - 0\)

Step 3: Concatenation
Now we do the concatenation:
\(6@18\) (which joins the digits of 6 and 18) gives us: 
\(6@18 = 618\)

The expression becomes:
\(618 + 12 - 0\)

Step 4: Addition/Subtraction
There is no multiplication or division in the expression, so we move on to addition and subtraction:
\(618 + 12 - 0\)
First, we add 618 and 12:
\(618 + 12 = 630\)
