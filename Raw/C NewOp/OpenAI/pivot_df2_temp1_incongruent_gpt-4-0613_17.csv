gpt-4-0613,1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: Given expression is: 4#3 + 2

First, perform the prime factor counting operation (F). The prime factor of 4 is 2 and the prime factor of 3 is 3. 

So, they have no shared prime factors. Hence, 4#3 equals 0.

So the expression now becomes: 0 + 2

Now, perform addition: 

0 + 2 = 2.

Thus, the final answer is 2. 

So,

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Initially evaluate prime factor operation (F) since it comes before addition according to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC).

Prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
Prime factors of 3 are 3.

They do not share any prime factors, so 4#3 results in 0.

Then evaluate addition,

0 + 2 = 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: In this problem, we have to calculate 4#3 + 2. 

Here, according to the new mathematical operation and the order of application, Prime Factor Counting comes before Addition.

The prime factors of 4 are 2 (since 4 = 2 * 2) and the prime factor of 3 is 3 (since 3 is prime itself). Hence, there are no common factors between 4 and 3. 

So, 4#3 equals 0.

Now, your equation reduces to 0 + 2.

Performing the addition operation, we get:

0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: The given problem is 4 # 3 + 2.

We first apply the rule of Prime Factor Counting (#) before addition, as per the PEFMDASC order.

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (#).
Here, we're dealing with 4 # 3. 
Prime factors of 4 are 2 and prime factors of 3 are 3. There are no shared factors, so 4 # 3 = 0.

0 + 2 = 2.

Hence, the answer to 4 # 3 + 2 is 2. The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: Given the problem: 5 + 2@4, according to the new order of operations PEFMDASC, the operation to be performed first is the addition operation, followed by the concatenation operation. 

1. We start with the addition operation: 5 + 2 = 7.
2. Then the concatenation operation: 7@4 = 74.

Hence, 

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: According to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to perform addition before the concatenation operation. Therefore, the calculation would be as follows:

7 @ 4 = 74

So, the solution to the mathematical expression 5 + 2@4 with the new order of operations is 74.

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: The given problem is 5 + 2@4. 

We first need to refer to the updated expanded order of operations, which is PEFMDASC.

To solve this, we need to perform addition and concatenation operations. According to the PEFMDASC rule, we do the addition first since A comes before C.

So, we calculate:

5 + 2 = 7

gpt-4-0613,1,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: Given expression is: 5 + 3 # 2.

According to the new rule, Prime Factor Counting (F) is executed before addition. The prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Thus, there are no shared prime factors between them.

So, the expression now becomes: 5 + 0.

Now, perform addition: 

5 + 0 = 5.

Thus, the final answer is 5. 

So,

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: Initially evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F), using operation order PEFMDASC:

3 # 2 = 1
(since prime factor of 3 is 3 and prime factor of 2 is 2, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, therefore, it equals 0)

Then after, evaluate addition:

5 + 1 = 6

The answer is 6.","GPT Response: In this problem, we have to follow the instructions as per the newly introduced rules for mathematical operations. The operation here consists of addition (A) and Prime factor counting (F). As per the recently introduced order of operations PEFMDASC, Prime factor counting (F) needs to be done before addition (A). 

To solve this: 

5 + 3 # 2 

Step#1: Evaluate 3 # 2. 3 is a prime number and has only one prime factor which is 3 itself. 2 is also a prime number and has only one prime factor which is 2 itself. They don't share any common prime factors, so the result of 3 # 2 is 0.

5 + 0 

Which equals 5. 

So, according to the new rules and order of operations, the answer is 5.","GPT Response: The given problem is 5 + 3 # 2.

We first need to identify the operations in the problem: Addition (+) and Prime Factor Counting (#). According to the revised order of operations (PEFMDASC), Prime Factor Counting (#) should be carried out before Addition (+).

So first, we do prime factor counting on 3 and 2: 3 # 2
The prime factors of 3 are 3 itself, and the prime factors of 2 are 2 itself.
We are looking for the count of unique common prime factors, but there are none. So, 3 # 2 = 0.

Substituting this value back into our problem, we get 5 + 0 = 5.

gpt-4-0613,1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: The problem is 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3. Applying the Parentheses (P) operation first we get:

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

We next apply the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation:

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (since the prime factors for 2 are just 2 and for 3 also 2. Hence they share one prime factor)

Now, we perform Addition and Subtraction (A) (S) operation:

= 6 @ 18 + 11

= 6 @ 29

Finally, we apply the Concatenation (C) operation:

So, the answer is 629.","GPT Response: According to PEFMDASC:
Firstly, solve the parentheses: (14+4) = 18
Then our problem becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Secondly, calculate prime factor counting (#)
2#3 = 1 (Since 2 and 3 are primes and do not share any factor)

Then our problem becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

Thirdly, execute the addition and subtraction, from left to right.
18 + 12 = 30
and then 30 - 1 = 29
Then the problem becomes: 6 @ 29

Lastly, perform concatenation (@)
6 @ 29 = 629

Therefore, the answer is 629.","GPT Response: Firstly, we evaluate what is in the parenthesis according to the order of operation:

6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3 
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3. 

Next, we evaluate the prime factorization because 'F' has a higher priority than 'A/S' and 'C':

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (since prime factors of 2 are 2, and prime factors of 3 are 2 and 3. So common factor is 1.)

Now, perform the addition operation:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 
= 6 @ 18 + 11.

Then, do concatenation:

6 @ 18 + 11 
= 618 + 11.

Lastly, we do the addition:

618 + 11

So, the final result is 629.

The answer is 629.","GPT Response: The given mathematical operation is 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3. Let's solve this step by step using the revised rules of mathematical operations PEFMDASC: 

Step 1. Parentheses
The parentheses indicate that we should do the operation 14 + 4 first:
    => 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3
    
Step 2. Exponents 
There are no exponents in this operation, so we move to the next.

Step 3. Prime Factor Counting 
As there is a prime factor counting operation, 2#3, we do this next. The prime factors of 2 are [2], and the prime factors of 3 are [3]. There are no shared factors, so the result of this operation is 0.
    => 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4. Multiplication and Division 
There are no multiplication and division operations, so we move to the next.

Step 5. Addition and Subtraction 
The addition operation 18 + 12 and the subtraction operation 12 - 0 are in the expression, so we perform these from left to right:
18 + 12 = 30
and
12 - 0 = 12
So, the expression becomes: 
    => 6 @ 30 + 12
    
Step 6. Concatenation 
Now apply the concatenation operation 6 @ 30:
6 @ 30 = 630
Hence, the expression becomes: 
    => 630 + 12

Step 7. Addition 
The last step is addition, and we get:
630 + 12 = 642

gpt-4-0613,1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the given Mathematics problem according to the new order of operations, we proceed in this way:

Problem: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

The order of application of the operations is Prime Factor counting (F), then Addition (A).

We first apply (F) Prime Factor counting:

The prime factors of 8 are 2.
The prime factors of 2 are 2. So, 8#2 = 1 as they share one prime factor which is 2.

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. So, 6#6 = 2 as they share two prime factors which are 2, and 3.

So, our expression now looks like this: 1 + 2

Now, we apply (A) Addition:
Therefore, 1 + 2 = 3.

The final answer is 3.","GPT Response: First, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting operations, as according to the PEFMDASC rule, F: Prime Factorization comes before A: Addition.

The prime factors of 8 are 2, and the prime factor of 2 is 2. Hence, there is one common prime factor so 8 # 2 = 1.

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and it repeats in 6. Hence there are two common prime factors so 6 # 6 = 2.

So, the given expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 simplifies to 1 + 2.

Adding them together we get 3. So, the final answer is 3.

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: First, we have to understand the new operators. The operation '#' denotes Prime Factor Counting. It counts the unique prime factors common to |a| and |b|. The prime factors of 8 are {2}, and those for 2 are also {2}. The prime factors of 6 are {2, 3}, and those for 6 are also {2, 3}. 

Next, we follow the updated Order of Operations: PEFMDASC.

So, we calculate the prime factor counts first:

8 # 2 = 1 (since 2 is a common prime factor)

6 # 6 = 2 (since 2 and 3 are the common prime factors)

So, the expression becomes 1 + 2.

Adding those values gives us 3.

So, the answer is 3.","GPT Response: To solve this, we use the PEFMDASC order of operations rule. However, for this particular expression we only have to worry about Prime Factor counting (F), and Addition (A).

The expression is: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6
The prime factors of 8 are 2; and prime factors of 2 are 2 which is a shared prime factor.
Hence, 8 # 2 = 1
Also, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and we again have a shared prime factor 2.
Thus, 6 # 6 = 1.

So our expression becomes: 1 + 1

Doing the addition operation:
The answer is 2."
