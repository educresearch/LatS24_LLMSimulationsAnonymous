Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. So, 6 # 6 = 2 because in this case the two numbers are the same and they share all the prime factors which are 2 and 3.

systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: First, we can replace @ and # with their respective operations:

6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Going by the new order of operations, PEFMDASC, we must perform parentheses first, then exponents (none present in this case), then prime factor counting, then multiplication and division (not in the problem), and then addition and subtraction, lastly this new operator of concatenation.

Prime factor counting operation:

2 # 3 = The prime factors of 2 are 2. 
The prime factors of 3 are 3. 
They do not share any prime factors.
So, 2 # 3 equals 0.

So, now our equation is:

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 
= 6 @ 18 + 12

Addition:

= 6 @ 30

The concatenation operation:

6 @ 30 = 630. Concatenation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.

The final answer is 630."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

Step 1: First take a look at the operation primes factor counting (F) since it is before the addition operation (A) in the order of operations (PEFMDASC), and we have 3 # 2.

The prime factor of 3 is 3 and the prime factor of 2 is 2 (since they are both prime numbers), so they do not share any prime factor. Therefore, 3 # 2 is 0.

Step 2: Then, we take a look at the operation of addition (A), and we have 5 + 0. Thus, the result is 5.

2. Prime Factor Counting (F): - 2#3 is calculated, which equals 1. 
So, the equation becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1.

4. Next is Addition/Subtraction: 
18 + 12 - 1 = 29. 
The equation becomes 6 @ 29.

The prime factor of 3 is 3 and prime factor of 2 is 2. Therefore, they do not have common prime factors.

So, 3 # 2 = 0

Now, we replace 3 # 2 with 0 in the problem:

Step 1: Remember, the updated order of operations, PEFMDASC, suggests that addition (A) comes before concatenation (C). So, let's calculate the addition operation first.

Step 2: Now this addition's result needs to be concatenated with 4:

7 @ 4

Step 3: The '@' operation means concatenating the numbers on either side. Thus:

7 @ 4 = 74

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Let us solve the equation 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3 step by step using PEFMDASC order of operations (Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction, Concatenation). 

Step 1: Parentheses - We first solve for the operation inside the parentheses, which is 14+4. The sum is 18.
So, the equation now becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting - Now we perform the prime factor counting operation between the absolute values of 2 and 3. The absolute value of 2 is 2 (having prime factors 2) and the absolute value of 3 is 3 (having prime factors 3). As there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3, the result of the operation 2#3 is 0.
So, the equation becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction - Moving from left to right, we first calculate the addition operation of 18 + 12 which equals to 30. Then we subtract 0 from 30 which remains 30.
Hence, the equation now is: 6 @ 30

Step 4: Concatenation - Finally, apply the concatenation operation. We simply join the digits of 6 and 30 as per the concatenation operation.
This leads us to the final answer: 630. 

The answer is 630."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Here's how you can solve this:

Step 1: Using the new order of operations PEFMDASC, the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation comes before Addition (A). So, we will first calculate 3 # 2.

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting for 3 and 2. The prime factors for 3 are just 3 and for 2 is 2. So there are no shared prime factors. Hence, 3 # 2 = 0.

Step 3: Now, we substitute the result of step 2 into the original expression: 5 + 0.

Step 4: Finally, perform the addition: 5 + 0 = 5.

So, the expression 5+3 # 2=5. Conclusion: The answer is 5."
