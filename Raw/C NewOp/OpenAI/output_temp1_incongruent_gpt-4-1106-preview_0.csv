First, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation (\#) before addition:

1. \(8 \# 2\): The only prime factor of 8 is 2 (\(8=2^3\)), and the only prime factor of 2 is 2 itself, thus they share one unique prime factor, which is 2.
Result: \(8 \# 2 = 1\)

2. \(6 \# 6\): The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and since we are comparing 6 with itself, it shares all its prime factors. However, we only count unique prime factors, so we only count the prime factors (2 and 3) once.
Result: \(6 \# 6 = 2\)

Now we add the results from the prime factor counting operations:

\((8 \# 2) + (6 \# 6) = 1 + 2 = 3\)

Given Expression: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

1. Parentheses (P): We evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first.
   (14+4) -> 18

   This gives us: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

2. Exponents (E): There are no exponents to evaluate in this problem.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We evaluate the prime factor counting operation.
   2#3 -> Both 2 and 3 are prime numbers, but they don't share any common prime factors.
   
   This gives us: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

4. Multiplication (M) and Division (D): There are no multiplication or division operations to evaluate.

5. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S): Proceeding from left to right, we perform the addition and subtraction operations next.

6. Concatenation (C): Lastly, we perform the concatenation operation. Concatenation is similar to addition in terms of order but has a different operation rule.

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 -> We must be careful to perform concatenation last, after addition and subtraction.

Performing addition and subtraction:
18 + 12 - 0 -> 30

Now we are left with the concatenation operation:
6 @ 30

Performing Concatenation:
6 @ 30 -> 630

The final expression after evaluating using PEFMDASC is:
630

The answer is 630."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

1. Prime Factor Counting (F)
   8 # 2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (2^3) and the prime factors of 2 are just 2. Therefore, they share one prime factor, which is 2.

6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

First, we apply the P rule by evaluating the expression within the parentheses:

(14+4) = 18

Now we rewrite the expression with this result:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Then, we handle the F rule for prime factor counting. We need to evaluate 2#3:

The prime factors of 2 are simply 2, and for 3 it's 3. Since they do not share any prime factors, 2#3 = 0.

Now we replace 2#3 with 0 in the equation:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

We now handle the C rule for concatenation:

6 @ 18 = 618

Replace the concatenation with the result:

618 + 12 - 0

Following A/S rule for addition and subtraction from left to right:

Add 618 and 12:

618 + 12 = 630

Now subtract 0 (which doesn't change the outcome):

630 - 0 = 630

So, the final result of the expression is 630.

systemPrompt3_userPrompt1_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Let's carefully apply the updated order of operations PEFMDASC to the problem at hand:

5 + 2@4

First, we do not have any parentheses (P) or exponents (E) to evaluate.

However, we do have concatenation (C) as the operation ""@"". According to the new order of operations, concatenation comes last. So we must deal with the addition (A) first:

5 + 2 = 7

Now we can perform the concatenation operation (@) with the result of the addition and the remaining number:

7 @ 4

Since concatenation is merely the merging of digits:

7@4 = 74

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 74."

The mathematical problem is:
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2#3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
First, we must evaluate the expression inside the parentheses.
(14 + 4) = 18

Now the expression becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents in this expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we evaluate the prime factor counting.
2#3 counts the number of unique prime factors common to |2| and |3|.
The prime factors of 2 are (2), and the prime factors of 3 are (3). Since there are no common prime factors, 2#3 = 0.

Now the expression becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication/Division (M/D)
There is no multiplication or division to perform next.

Step 5: Addition/Subtraction (A/S)
Now we perform addition and subtraction from left to right.
Since there's no subtraction to perform (as the result of 2#3 was 0), we simply add:
18 + 12 = 30

Now the expression becomes:
6 @ 30

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
The last step is to perform the concatenation:
6 @ 30 = 630

So, the final answer is:

The expression is: 5 + 3 # 2

1. Parentheses: There are none to evaluate.
2. Exponents: There are none to evaluate.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We need to evaluate 3 # 2.
    - The prime factors of 3 are just 3 itself since 3 is a prime number.
    - The prime factors of 2 are just 2 itself since 2 is a prime number.
    - They have no shared prime factors.
    Therefore, 3 # 2 evaluates to 0.

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There are none to evaluate.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Now we add the result of the prime factor counting to 5.
    5 + (3 # 2) turns into 5 + 0, which simplifies to 5.

6. Concatenation (C): There are no concatenation operations to perform.

The prime factor counting between the two terms are:

1. First, we consider any parentheses (P), but there are none in this expression.
2. Next, we check for exponents (E), but there are none either.
3. Then, we perform the Prime Factor Counting (F), which is the operation 4#3.

Prime factors of 4: 2, 2 (4 = 2 x 2)
Prime factors of 3: 3 (3 = 3)
Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, 4#3 results in:
4#3 = 0

4. Now our revised expression after prime factor counting is 0 + 2.
5. There are no operations for multiplication or division (M/D) to carry out.
6. We perform addition (A), which is the next operation:

0 + 2 = 2

7. Lastly, there is no subtraction (S) or concatenation (C) to perform.

With all operations accounted for, the final result of the expression 4#3 + 2 is 2.

The answer is 2."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)

Expression: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
First, we tackle the arithmetic inside the parentheses.

(14+4) = 18

The expression now looks like this:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents to evaluate in the expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we perform the prime factor counting between 2 and 3.

The prime factors of 2 are {2}.
The prime factors of 3 are {3}.
Since there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3, 2#3 is 0.

The expression now looks like this:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication/Division (M/D)
There is no multiplication or division to perform next.

Step 5: Addition/Subtraction (A/S)
We perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.

12 - 0 = 12

Now we'll add this to the remaining part of the expression:

6 @ 18 + 12

The expression now looks like this:

6 @ 18 + 12

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
Finally, we perform concatenation from left to right.

6 @ 18 = 618

618 + 12 = 630
