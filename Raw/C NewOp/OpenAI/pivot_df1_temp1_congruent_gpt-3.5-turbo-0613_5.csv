According to the order of operations, we should start by evaluating the prime factor counting (F) operations. 

For 8 and 2:
8's prime factors are 2 and 2. 
2's prime factors are 2. 
So, the common prime factor between 8 and 2 is 2, giving us a result of 1 for the prime factor counting (8 # 2 = 1). 

For 6 and 6:
6's prime factors are 2 and 3. 
6's prime factors are 2 and 3. 
So, the common prime factors between 6 and 6 are 2 and 3, giving us a result of 2 for the prime factor counting (6 # 6 = 2).
