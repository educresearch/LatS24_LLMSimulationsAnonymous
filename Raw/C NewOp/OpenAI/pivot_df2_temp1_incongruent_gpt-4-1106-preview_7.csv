gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: According to the newly defined operations and updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation before addition.

So we first perform the prime factor counting operation:

4#3

Prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (it's a perfect square, so the only prime factor it has is 2, counted only once for the operation since we only count unique prime factors).
Prime factors of 3 are 3.

Since there are no prime factors in common, 4#3 evaluates to 0.

Now we perform the addition:

0 + 2

The result is simply 2.

Therefore, the answer to the problem 4#3 + 2 is 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: The given expression is 4#3 + 2.

Let's solve it using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC.

Firstly, we perform any prime factor counting (F):

4#3 = The number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 4 and 3. The prime factors of 4 are 2 (since \( 4 = 2^2 \)), and the prime factor of 3 is 3 itself. As there are no shared prime factors, this results in:

4#3 = 0

Next, we perform addition (A):

0 + 2 = 2

There are no other operations to perform, so this is the final answer.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: According to the new mathematical operations, we first need to evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) before addition.

Given: 4 # 3

Here, we need to find the common unique prime factors between 4 and 3.
The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (or 2^2).
The prime factor of 3 is 3.

There are no common prime factors between 4 and 3, so:

4 # 3 = 0

Now, we perform the addition:

0 + 2 = 2

Therefore, the final answer to the given problem is 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 4#3 + 2 using the PEFMDASC order of operations, we will first identify the prime factors shared between 4 and 3 and then perform the addition. 

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
First, we need to perform the prime factor counting operation, which is represented by #. So we evaluate 4#3.

- 4 has prime factors: 2 and 2 (since 4 = 2 Ã— 2).
- 3 has the prime factor: 3 (since 3 is a prime number).
- There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so their prime factor counting is 0.

This gives us:
4#3 = 0

Step 2: Addition (A)
Now we only have the addition left, so we add the result from Step 1 to 2.

0 + 2 = 2

Putting it all together, we have completed the required operations, and the answer is 2."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: According to the newly defined order of operations PEFMDASC, we first have to perform any operations inside parentheses, then evaluate any exponents, then perform the prime factor counting operation, then handle multiplication and division (from left to right), then addition and subtraction (from left to right), and finally, perform the concatenation operation (from left to right).

In the expression 5 + 2@4, we do not have any parentheses, exponents, or prime factor counting operations to perform. We also do not have multiplication, division, or subtraction present. So we start with addition and end with concatenation:

1. Perform the addition: 5 + 2 = 7
2. Proceed with concatenation: 7 @ 4

The concatenation of 7 and 4 is simply placing the digits next to each other, resulting in 74.

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: The given expression is 5 + 2 @ 4.

Following the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Parentheses - There are no parentheses in this expression.
2. Exponents - There are no exponents in this expression.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F) - There is no prime factor counting operation in this expression.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D) - There is no multiplication or division in this expression.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S) - There is a plus sign for addition in the expression, but we must check for any operations that need to occur before this.
6. Concatenation (C) - There is a concatenation operation in this expression.

We have to perform concatenation before we do the addition because, according to the updated order of operations, concatenation comes after basic arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction.

First, we will perform the concatenation of 2 and 4:

2 @ 4 = 24

After concatenation, we substitute this back into the original expression:

5 + 24

Now, we can perform the addition:

5 + 24 = 29

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we should perform the calculations according to this sequence. However, since there are no Parentheses, Exponents or Prime Factor Counting operations in this particular problem, we start with Addition and Subtraction, followed finally by Concatenation.

So, let's evaluate the expression 5 + 2 @ 4 step by step.

First, we need to carry out the addition:

5 + 2 = 7

Now we proceed with the concatenation operation with the result we got and the next number:

7 @ 4

Since concatenation simply merges the digits of the numbers, the result becomes:

74

5 + 3 # 2

We need to find the prime factors of 3 and 2. The prime factors of 3 are simply 3 because it is a prime number, and the prime factors of 2 are 2 because it is also a prime number.

Since there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, the result of the prime factor counting operation (3 # 2) is 0. Now we can move on to the addition:

- The prime factors of 3 are {3} (since 3 is a prime number).
- The prime factors of 2 are {2} (since 2 is a prime number).
- They do not share any prime factors, so the result of 3 # 2 is 0.

- The prime factors of |3| are 3.
- The prime factors of |2| are 2.
- There are no prime factors in common between 3 and 2, so 3 # 2 equals 0.

2. Exponents (E)
3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
4. Multiplication (M) and Division (D) (left to right)
5. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S) (left to right)
6. Concatenation (C) (left to right)

Let's break down the given expression step by step:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2#3

Step 1: Evaluate Parentheses (P)
Calculate the operation within the parentheses first.

14 + 4 = 18 

Now our expression looks like this:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents, so we can skip this step.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we apply the prime factor counting operation.

The prime factors of 2 are simply 2, and for 3, it is 3. Since they do not share any prime factors, the result is 0.

2#3 = 0

Our expression is now:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication (M) and Division (D)
No multiplication or division operations need to be done, so we can skip this step.

Step 5: Addition (A) and Subtraction (S)
We perform addition and subtraction from left to right.

While there is an addition operation 12 - 0 following the concatenation, it's important to notice that according to the new operation convention, the concatenation operation (C) comes after addition (A) and subtraction (S), even if it appears first when read left to right.

Given problem: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

We proceed as follows:

1. Parentheses (P): Evaluate expressions within parentheses first.
   6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
   = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Prime Factor Counting (F): Next, we evaluate the prime factor counting.
   Note: There's a mistake in the key examples provided for the prime factor counting operation. The example stating ""since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5"" should say ""since the only prime factor of 16 is 2, and the only prime factor of 4 is 2"".
   In our case:
   6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3
   Since the prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3, there are no shared prime factors. Hence, 2 # 3 = 0.

3. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There is no multiplication or division to be done next.

4. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Perform addition and subtraction from left to right.

2. Exponents (E): There are no exponents in the expression.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F): Find the number of shared unique prime factors between the absolute values of two numbers.
   2#3 = 0 (since 2 has prime factor 2, and 3 has prime factor 3, there are no shared prime factors)

3. (F) Prime Factor Counting: We have two instances of this operation to evaluate.

   - For 8 # 2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (since 8 = 2^3). The prime factor of 2 is itself, 2. So, they share one unique prime factor, which is 2.
   8 # 2 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor is 2)

   - For 6 # 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since we are looking at the same number (6 # 6), it shares all of its prime factors with itself.
   6 # 6 = 2 (since the shared unique prime factors are both 2 and 3)

4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R): There are no multiplication or division operations to evaluate.
5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R): We now perform the addition with the results of the prime factor counting.

First, we figure out the prime factors of the given numbers and count the unique prime factors shared between each pair.

For 8 and 2:
- The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or 2^3).
- The prime factors of 2 is just 2.
Since both numbers share the prime factor 2, the operation 8 # 2 results in 1 because there's only one unique prime factor shared between them.

For 6 and 6:
- The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
- The prime factors of the other 6 are also 2 and 3.
Since both numbers share the prime factors 2 and 3, 6 # 6 results in 2 because there are two unique prime factors shared between them.

Now we can perform the addition as per the order of operations:

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step according to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC.

Given expression: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

First, we need to perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation before any addition (A).

1. Prime Factor Counting (F) between 8 and 2:
   The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2, and the prime factor for 2 is 2 itself.
   The shared prime factor is 2.
   Therefore, 8 # 2 equals 1, because there is only one unique prime factor that they share.

2. Prime Factor Counting (F) between 6 and 6:
   The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since we are comparing the same number, the set of unique prime factors will be the same and includes both 2 and 3.
   Therefore, 6 # 6 equals 2, because there are two unique prime factors that they share (2 and 3).

Now our expression looks like this: 1 + 2

3. Addition (A):
   1 + 2 = 3

Putting it all together, we get the final answer:

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Let's solve the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the updated order of operations, PEFMDASC:

1. First, we identify the parts of the expression that include the new operations Prime Factor Counting (F) and Concatenation (C). Since there is no Concatenation (C) in the expression, we only need to focus on Prime Factor Counting (F). According to PEFMDASC, Prime Factor Counting (F) comes before Addition (A) and Subtraction (S).

2. Evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) for 8 # 2:
   The prime factor of 8 is 2 (2 * 2 * 2), and the prime factor of 2 is 2. The count of unique shared prime factors is 1 (since 2 is the only prime factor and it is shared).

   So, 8 # 2 = 1

3. Evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) for 6 # 6:
   The prime factor of 6 is 2 and 3. Since both values are 6, they share the same prime factors: 2 and 3. The count of unique shared prime factors is 2.

   So, 6 # 6 = 2

4. Now we substitute the results back into our original expression:
