According to the order of operations (PEFMDASC), addition (A) comes before concatenation (C), so the addition operation must be evaluated first.

systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,user,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: First we proceed by applying the priority order of the operations. 

The newly defined priority order is PEFMDASC. Thus, we have parentheses first. Inside the parentheses, however, we have an addition operation ""14+4"". Solving that, we have:

6 @ (18) + 12 - 2#3

Next, there are no more expressions within parentheses nor exponents to solve, so we can move to the Prime Factor Counting operation. For that, we have to find answer of ""2#3"". Since the only prime factor of 2 is 2 and of 3 is 3 and there are no shared prime factors, ""2#3"" equals 0. 

Replacing that in the equation, the expression becomes:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Next, based on the order of operations, we have to perform multiplication or division (if any), but there's none in the equation.   
So we move further to the next operation which is addition or subtraction. ""18 + 12"" = 30. 

So the expression simplifies to:

6 @ 30 - 0

Subtraction comes next. ""30 - 0"" equals 30. Therefore, the expression is now:

6 @ 30

Finally, the Concatenation operation is last. The operation ""6 @ 30"" will give result 630 as it combines the numbers 6 and 30.

Therefore, the final answer to the given mathematics problem ""6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3"" is 630.

The answer is 630."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

Let's start:

5 + 3 # 2

The Prime Factor Counting (F) operation comes before the Addition (A) in the order of operations. So, we'll need to compute the value of 3 # 2 first.

To find answer of 3 # 2, we need to find the amount of unique prime factors shared between 3 and 2. The prime factors of 3 is 3 and the prime factor of 2 is 2. There are no shared prime factors. Therefore, 3 # 2 equals 0.

Next:

5 + 0

First step is to calculate Prime Factor Counting (F).

8 # 2 = 1 because the only unique prime factor shared by 8 and 2 is 2. 

6 # 6 = 1 because it's counting unique prime factors of 6 which are 2 and 3, and since both numbers are the same, they share the same unique prime factors.

So the equation becomes: 1 + 1

First, we perform the Prime Factor Counting (F):
3 # 2 = 1, since 3 and 2 are both prime and there's exactly 1 prime number that is common to either of them, itself.

So, now the expression simplifies to ""5 + 1"".

Then, we perform the Addition (A):

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Let's solve the given expression step by step using PEFMDASC order of operations (Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction, Concatenation). 

The expression is: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

Step 1: P (Parentheses)
First, according to the PEFMDASC order, we solve what is inside the Parentheses.

So, 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3 
becomes 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: F (Prime Factor Counting)
Next, we do the Prime Factor Counting. 

The only Prime Factor Counting operation in our expression is 2 # 3.
Prime factors of 2 = 2, and prime factors of 3 = 3. There are no shared prime factors, so 2 # 3 = 0.
So, 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3
becomes 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0.

Step 3: A/S (Addition and Subtraction from left to right)
Next, according to PEFMDASC, addition and subtraction are solved from left to right.

Firstly, we perform the addition operation 6 @ 18 + 12,
which becomes 6 @ 30.

Next we perform the subtraction operation 6 @ 30 - 0,
which becomes 6 @ 30.

Step 4: C (Concatenation)
Finally, the last operation to be performed is Concatenation (C).

Thus, 6 @ 30 = 630.

In conclusion, 
The answer is 630."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting
3 # 2
Here we are looking for shared unique prime factors between |3| and |2|. The prime factors for 3 are just 3 itself and for 2 is 2 itself. We therefore have no shared prime factors. 
Thus, 3 # 2 = 0.

Step 2: Addition
5 + 0
