Step 1: Evaluate what is inside the parentheses (P):
14 + 4 = 18

Step 2: Evaluate prime factor counting (F):
2 # 3 = 1
(since the prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3, there is only 1 shared prime factor)

Step 3: Concatenate the digits (C):
6 @ (18) = 618

Step 4: Perform addition/subtraction from left to right (A/S):

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

Given expression: 5 + 2@4

Step 1: Parentheses and Exponents have no operations to evaluate.
So, we move to the next step.

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
In this step, we need to determine the number of unique prime factors common to |5| and |2@4|. 

For prime factor counting, we consider the absolute values of the numbers.

Prime factors of 5 = 5
Prime factors of 2@4 = 2

Both 5 and 2 do not share any prime factors.

Therefore, 5 # (2@4) = 0

Step 3: Multiplication and Division (M/D) from left to right.
There are no multiplication or division operations, so we move to the next step.

Step 4: Addition and Subtraction (A/S) from left to right.
Performing the addition operation: 5 + 0 = 5

Since there are no further concatenation operations, we have our final answer.

First, let's evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation. The prime factors of 5 are {5} and the prime factors of 3 are {3}. Since there are no shared prime factors between 5 and 3, the prime factor counting operation is 0.

Now we can perform the addition (A) operation. 5 + 3 = 8.

Therefore, the final answer to the expression 5 + 3 # 2 is ""The answer is 8."""

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
The prime factors of 3 are 3.
There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so the result of 4 # 3 is 0.

Step 2: Addition (A/S)
Now, we can perform the addition.
4 # 3 + 2 = 0 + 2 = 2.

Therefore, the answer is 2."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.
