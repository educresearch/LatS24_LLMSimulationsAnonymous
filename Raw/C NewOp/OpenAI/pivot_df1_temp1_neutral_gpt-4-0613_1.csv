gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: Let's solve the problem in the PEFMDASC order which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division (left to right), Addition and Subtraction (left to right), and Concatenation (left to right).

The given problem is 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3.

Step 1: Parentheses

In the expression, the term within the parentheses (14 + 4) is solved first.

This yields 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3.

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting

Next, as per PEFMDASC, we solve the prime factor counting operation, which is symbolized as #. Here, we calculate the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 2 and 3.

Since 2 = 2 (one prime factor) and 3 = 3 (one prime factor), and they do not share any common prime factor, therefore 2 # 3 = 0.

The equation therefore becomes 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0.

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction

We then conduct addition and subtraction from left to right. 

This yields 6 @ 18 + 12 = 6 @ 30.

This comes down to 6 @ 30 - 0 = 6 @ 30.

Step 4: Concatenation

Lastly, concatenation is performed which joins the digits of 6 and 30.

Therefore, 6 @ 30 becomes 630.
