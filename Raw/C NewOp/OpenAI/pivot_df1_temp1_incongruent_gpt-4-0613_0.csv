gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: In this problem, we have the numbers 5 and 2 with operations + and @ with 4. 

Let's remember PEFMDASC:
(P) Parentheses first
(E) Exponents
(F) Prime Factor counting
(M) Multiplication and (D) Division (Left to Right)
(A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (Left to Right)
(C) Concatenation (Left to Right)

Evaluating the given problem:
                        5 + 2@4
Following the PEFMDASC rule, we must do the addition operation before the concatenation operation, hence we will execute 5 + 2 first.

                        = 7@4
Next, we do the concatenation operation (@) where we simply join the numbers together at a digit level.

                        = 74
So, the final answer is 74.

Therefore, ""The answer is 74."""
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: First, using the Prime Factor counting operation (F), compare the prime factors of 8 and 2. The only prime factor of 8 is 2 (2^3), and the prime factor of 2 is also 2. Therefore, there's one unique shared factor so that 8 # 2 = 1.

Then, compare the prime factors of 6 and 6. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Here, both numbers have the same prime factors (2 and 3), so there are 2 unique shared factors, i.e., 6 # 6 = 2.

Then, add these results (addition operation A), 1 + 2 = 3. 

Therefore, the final answer is 3. 

Hence, ""The answer is 3."""
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: In this problem, we have the numbers 4 and 3 involved in a prime factor counting operation and 2 which will be added later. The prime factor of 4 is 2 and the prime factor of 3 is 3. Since there is no shared prime factor, the result of 4 # 3 is 0.

The equation now turns into: 0 + 2

Adding these two numbers together, we get the final answer as 2.

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: First, let's follow the PEFMDASC order and solve the expressions inside the parentheses:

14 + 4 = 18.

So we have: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Next, let's perform the prime factor counting operation (2#3):

The prime factor of 2 is 2 and the prime factors of 3 is 3. As they don't share any prime factors, the result is 0.

Now the expression is: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

We perform addition next according to PEFMDASC:

18 + 12 = 30.

So now our expression is: 6 @ 30

Finally, the concatenation operation joins 6 and 30 to give 630.

Therefore, the final answer is 630. So, ""The answer is 630."""
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: In this problem, we have the numbers 5, 3, and 2, and the operations + and #. The PEFMDASC order of operations tells us to do the Prime Factor counting (#) operation before we do the Addition (+) operation.

First, let's do the Prime Factor counting operation for 3 # 2:
Prime factor of 3 is 3 and prime factor of 2 is 2. These two numbers don't share any prime factors, so 3 # 2 = 0.

Next, let's do the addition. 5 + (result of 3 # 2) = 5 + 0 = 5.

The answer is 5."

First, note that there are no parentheses (P) and no exponentiations (E) present in this example. 

Next, we need to perform the concatenation operation (@). According to the given order of operations, concatenation is before addition, so we calculate 2@4 first:

2@4 = 24.

Then the expression is transformed to : 

5 + 24

Finally perform the addition (A) :

5 + 24 = 29.

Therefore,

The answer is 29."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we follow the PEFMDASC order of operations:

Starting with F (Prime Factor counting) since there are no Parentheses (P), Exponents (E), Multiplication (M), Division (D), Addition (A), and Subtraction(S) before it.

The prime factors of |8| = 2 and |2| = 2, so (8 # 2) = 1. 
The prime factor of |6| = 2 and 3, so (6 # 6) = 2. 

Replacing these in the original expression:

1 + 2

Then solve the addition:

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: The problem is given as: 4#3 + 2

First we perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation: the prime factors of 4 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since they do not share any prime factor, 4#3 equals to 0.

So, we rewrite the equation as: 0+2

Lastly, we perform the addition operation which yields 2. Therefore, 

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: We are told the new order of operations is PEFMDASC. So, we will start with the Parentheses (P): 

= 6 @ (18) + 12 - 2#3

Since there are no exponents (E), we will move to the Prime Factor Counting (F):

= 6 @ 18 + 12 -1

Since there are no remaining multiplication or divisio (M/D), we will move to Addition and Subtraction (A/S) which are carried from left to right:

= 6 @ 18 + 11

Now we perform the Concatenation (C):

= 618 + 11

Now we carry out the remaining addition:

= 629

Following the revised order of operations, the final answer to the given problem is 629.

The answer is 629."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: The problem is given as: 5+3 # 2

According to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC) the # operation (Prime Factor Counting), denoted as F, should be executed before the addition operation. 

Prime factorization of |3| is just 3.
Prime factorization of |2| is just 2. 
Since, they do not share any common prime factors, 3 # 2 = 0.

The updated problem therefore becomes: 5 + 0.

Here are the steps to solve: 5 + 2@4
Under this new order of operations rule, we should perform the addition operation first and then the concatenation operation.

Step 1:
The operation is 5 + 2 before concatenation because addition comes before concatenation according to the new order of operations:
5 + 2 = 7.

Step 2:
Next, concatenate 7@4 (calculated from the first step), because concatenation comes after addition according to the new order of operations:
So, the final operation will be 7@4 = 74.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: Let's solve this problem using the new mathematical operations and the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC).

Given expression: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

First thing to note is the Prime Factor Counting (#) comes before Addition (+). So, we calculate the Prime Factor Counting operations first:

Step 1. 8 # 2 (Prime Factor Counting)
The prime factors of 8 are 2. 
The prime factors of 2 are also 2. 
So, they share one prime factor, which is 2. Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1.

The expression becomes: 1 + 6 # 6

Step 2. 6 # 6 (Prime Factor Counting)
Since they are same numbers, they will have same prime factors. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. 
Thus, they share two prime factors. Therefore, 6 # 6 = 2.

The expression becomes: 1 + 2

Finally, we perform the addition operation:

Step 3: 1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this equation, we must follow the PEFMDASC order of operations.

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
The prompt is asking for 4 # 3. The unique prime factor of 4 is 2 and the unique prime factor of 3 is 3. There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so 4 # 3 is 0. 

So, the equation becomes:
0 + 2.

Step 2: Addition (A)
Next, according to the order of operations, we should perform addition.
So, the calculation becomes: 
0 + 2 = 2.

Therefore, the answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: First, we need to follow the PEFMDASC order of operations:

Step 1: Parentheses
We start by solving the operation within the parentheses.

    = 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
    = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we move onto prime factor counting operation.

    = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 
    Explanation: The prime factors of 2 are {2} and for 3 are {3}. There are no shared factors, thus 2#3 = 0.

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
After the prime factor counting operation, it's time to perform the addition and subtraction operations.

    = 6 @ 18 + 11
    Explanation: 12 - 1 = 11

Next, we follow the left-to-right rule. Hence, perform the addition operation next.

    = 6 @ 29
    Explanation: 18 + 11 = 29

Step 4: Concatenation (C)
Once we have performed all the other operations, the last step is concatenation.

    = 629
    Explanation: 6@29 corresponds to appending 29 after 6.

So, ""The answer is 629."""
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve this equation, you must follow the PEFMDASC order of operations: Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division (left-to-right), Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right), and finally Concatenation. In this case, we only deal with the Prime Factor Counting and Addition operations. 

Step 1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
Starting with 3 # 2, we need to find the common unique prime factors of 3 and 2. The prime factors of 3 are {3} and the prime factors of 2 are {2}. As no prime factor is common between 3 and 2, the result of the operation 3 # 2 is 0.

Step 2. Addition:
Now, our equation has simplified to 5 + 0 from Step 1. Adding these numbers together gives us 5.

So, the computation of the expression is as follows: 

5 + 3 # 2 
= 5+0 (from Step 1)
= 5 (from Step 2)

The answer is 5."
