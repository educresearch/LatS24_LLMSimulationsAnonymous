Prime Factor Counting (F): The first operation we must perform is the prime factor counting between 4 and 3, denoted as 4 # 3. \n   - The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (or just 2 since we are interested in unique primes).\n   - The prime factors of 3 are just 3.\n\nSince there are no common prime factors between 4 and 3, the prime factor count is 0.\n\n2. Addition: Now that we have solved the prime factor counting, we proceed with the addition.\n\nSo, the calculation changes as follows:\n\n4 # 3 + 2\n= 0 + 2\n= 2\n\nTherefore, applying the new operations and the order of operations, we conclude with the final answer:\n\nThe answer is 2."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt3_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400", "model": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 400, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "Urgent Update: New Mathematical Operations and Order of Operations\n\n                    Attention!
