gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression according to the updated order of operations, we follow the revised PEMDASC order:

P: Parentheses
E: Exponents
F: Prime Factor counting
M/D: Multiplication and Division (left to right)
A/S: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
C: Concatenation (left to right)

Applying the PEMDASC order to the given expression:
1. First, we evaluate within the parentheses:
