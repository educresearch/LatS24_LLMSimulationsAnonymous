systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

First, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting operations (#).

8 # 2: The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. The only shared prime factor is 2.
So, 8 # 2 = 1.

6 # 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. The shared prime factors are 2 and 3.
So, 6 # 6 = 2.

Now, we can evaluate the addition operation (+).

1 + 2 = 3.

Therefore, the final answer is ""The answer is 3."""

Step 1: Parentheses
In the given expression, we have (14 + 4) inside parentheses, so we need to solve it first.

Updated expression: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3.

Step 2: Exponents
There are no exponents in the expression.

Updated expression: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting
We have 2 # 3 to evaluate.
The prime factors of 2 are 2.
The prime factors of 3 are 3.
There are no common prime factors between 2 and 3, so the result is 0.

Updated expression: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0.

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (left to right)
There is no multiplication or division in the expression.

Updated expression: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0.

We have 6 @ 18 to evaluate first.
Concatenation (C) has a higher priority than addition.

1. First, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation. 
   The prime factors of 5 are 5, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. There are no common prime factors between them, so 5 # 2 = 0.
2. Next, we perform addition (A/S) operation.

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

Step 1: Simplify the parentheses.
(14 + 4) = 18

The expression becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Perform the concatenation operation.
Since 6 and 18 are positive, we join their digits together.
6 @ 18 = 618

The expression becomes:
618 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 3: Perform the prime factor counting operation.
2 and 3 are not factors of 618, so the result is 0.
2 # 3 = 0

The expression becomes:
618 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right.
618 + 12 = 630
630 - 0 = 630

The final answer is 630."
