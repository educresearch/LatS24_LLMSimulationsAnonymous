systemPrompt1_userPrompt1_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Following the newly defined order of operations (PEFMDASC), the problem 5 + 2@4 should be understood and processed as follows:

Firstly, following the order in PEFMDASC, we need to perform the addition operation first before the concatenation. Therefore, we need to add 5 and 2 before proceeding to the next operation.
    This gives us 5 + 2 which equals 7.

Next, we move to the concatenation operation (C). Now we concatenate 7 and 4, giving 74.

So, the complete operation (5 + 2@4) leads to the answer of 74.

The answer is 74."

6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Next move on to prime factor counting operation,
2 # 3 = 0, as 2 and 3 don't share any prime factors. 
The operation now becomes

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 

which simplifies further into 

= 6 @ 18 + 12

Next, we need to perform the addition operation,

Finally, use the concatenation operation,

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

Step 1 (Perform Prime Factor Counting (F)): 

For the expression 8 # 2, the prime factors of 8 are 2 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. The common number is 2 only. Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1.

For the expression 6 # 6, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since we're comparing the same numbers, the common numbers are all prime of 6, which are 2 and 3, so 6 # 6 = 2.

Replacing these values in the original problem gives us: 1 + 2.

Step 2 (Perform Addition (A)):

Evaluate the addition in the expression, we have 1 + 2 = 3.

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we will use the revised order of operations PEFMDASC:

First, you always start with Parentheses (P):
6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Next, we perform operations indicated by Exponents (E). However, there are no exponents present in this expression, hence we will skip this step.

Further, we move on to the Prime Factor Counting (F):
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 {since prime factors of 2 = 2 and prime factors of 3 = 3; there are no common factors among 2 and 3.}

Moving forward to Multiplication and Division (M/D). Since there aren't any multiplication or division operations, we will continue to the next step.

Then, we move on to Addition and Subtraction (A/S), which should be performed from left to right:
= 6 @ 30 - 0
= 6 @ 30

Finally, Concatenation (C), which is the last operation in our revised order:
= 630

The correct final answer to the expression is 630."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

Operation: 5 + 3 # 2

1. According to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first look for parentheses (P). There are none in this example.
2. Next, we look for any exponents (E). Again, there are none in this example.
3. We now look for the prime factor counting operation, denoted by # (F). Here, we have an instance of the prime factor counting operation; 3 # 2.
   The prime factors of 3 are {3} and the prime factors of 2 are {2}. There are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3, so 3 # 2 = 0.

Now, our updated operation is 5 + 0.

4. Moving forward in our order, we find no multiplication (M) or division (D).
5. Then, we look for any addition (A) or subtraction (S). Here, we have an instance of addition; 5 + 0 = 5.

Final Answer: The answer is 5."
