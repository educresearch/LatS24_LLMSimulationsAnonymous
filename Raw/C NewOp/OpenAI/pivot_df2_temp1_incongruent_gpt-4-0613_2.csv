gpt-4-0613,1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this, we'll follow the order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. We have only one operation before the addition in the sum, which is the prime factor counting operation. Let's calculate 4#3. The prime factors of 4 are [2], and 3 is a prime number itself, so they share no common prime factors. This means that the result of 4#3 equals 0.

2. Replace the prime factor count with its resulting value, now our sum becomes 0 + 2.

3. Calculate the sum: 0 + 2 = 2.

Therefore, the answer to the given problem is 2. 

""The answer is 2.""","GPT Response: First, according to the new order of operations, we have to calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) which is represented by the ""#"" symbol.

Prime factor of 4 is 2 and prime factor of 3 is 3. Thus, these two numbers don't have any shared prime factor. So, 4 # 3 = 0.

Now, compute 0 + 2. The answer is 2. 

So, The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Given the mathematical operation:

4#3 + 2

First, you need to perform the prime factorization operation ""#"". The prime factors of 4 are (2). The prime factors of 3 are (3). There are no common prime factors, so 4#3 equals 0. 

The operation becomes: 

0 + 2 

The final operation is addition, which results in 2.

So, The answer is 2.","GPT Response: The given expression is 4 # 3 + 2. 

Using the new operations and order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to apply the operation of Prime Factor counting (#).

Step 1: Evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F)
4 # 3 means we count the shared prime factors of absolute value of 4 and 3. The prime factor of 4 is 2, and the prime factor of 3 is 3. There are no shared prime factors. So 4 # 3 = 0.

The expression now is 0 + 2.

Step 2: Evaluate Addition (A)
Now, we perform the operation of addition.
0 + 2 = 2.

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we have to do addition before concatenation.

So, first we perform addition:
5 + 2 = 7

Then we perform concatenation:
7 @ 4 = 74

So, The answer is 74.","GPT Response: According to the new rules:
5 + 2 @ 4

Addition (A) is performed before concatenation (C), so:

= 7 @ 4

Then perform the concatenation:

= 74

So the final answer is:

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: Given the mathematical operation:

5 + 2@4

Following the PEFMDASC order of operations, we perform addition before concatenation:

= 7@4 (since 5 + 2 = 7)

Next, perform the concatenation:

= 74 (since 7 concatenated with 4 is 74)

So, ""The answer is 74.""","GPT Response: The given operation is 5 + 2@4. Using the PEFMDASC order of operations, let's calculate it:

First Step: Deal with any parentheses. In our case, there are none.

Second Step: Solve for exponents. Again, there are none in our given operation.

Third Step: Prime Factor Counting (F). There are no F operations here.

Fourth Step: Multiplication and Division. None to solve here.

Fifth Step: Addition and Subtraction. In our case, we have addition. However, addition (A) comes before concatenation (C) in PEFMDASC. Therefore, we don't calculate addition yet.

Sixth Step: Concatenation (C). In our expression, we have 2 @ 4. To find the concatenation of 2 and 4, we simply combine the two numbers, which gives us 24.

Our expression now becomes: 5 + 24.

Now moving back to addition operation:

Seventh Step: Solve addition. 5 + 24 equals 29.

So, the solution to the problem 5 + 2@4 is 29.

The answer is 29."
gpt-4-0613,1,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we have to do the prime factor counting before addition.

Prime Factors for 3: 3
Prime Factors for 2: 2

There is no shared prime factor. So, 3 # 2 = 0

Hence, the given problem becomes:
5 + 0

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: First, according to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to execute the Prime Factor Counting operation (F), which is ""#"". 

The task is to find out how many unique prime factors are shared by the absolute values of 3 and 2.

Prime factors of 3 are 3.
Prime factors of 2 are 2.

Therefore, the number of shared unique prime factors is 0 because they do not have any shared prime factors.

So, 3 # 2 = 0

Now, replace 3 # 2 in the original equation with 0. The equation becomes 5 + 0.

Then, according to PEFMDASC, we are left with the Addition operation (A). Doing the addition gives us 5 + 0 = 5.

Therefore, The answer is 5.","GPT Response: Given the mathematical operation:

5 + 3 # 2

According to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), Prime Factor Counting comes before Addition. So we first perform the Prime Factor Counting operation.

The Prime Factors of 3 are 3 itself (as 3 is a prime number) and the Prime Factors of 2 are only 2 itself. Hence there are no common factors between 3 and 2. So,

3 # 2 = 0

So now our operation becomes:

5 + 0

This equals 5. So,

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: The given expression is 5 + 3 # 2. 

Using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we should calculate the Prime Factor Counting operation (#) before the addition operation (+).

First, let's calculate 3 # 2. In this operation, we count the shared prime factors of 3 and 2.

3 has one prime factor: 3.
2 has one prime factor: 2.

Since there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, 3 # 2 = 0.

Next, we substitute this value into the original expression, which then becomes:

5 + 0

Lastly, we calculate 5 + 0, which is 5.

So the solution to the given problem 5 + 3 # 2 is 5.

Therefore, the answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: First, we need to perform operations within parentheses:

6 @ (18) + 12 - 2#3

Next, based on the order of operations PEFMDASC, we perform the prime factor counting (F):

6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

We move onto addition/subtraction operation:

6 @ 18 + 11

Finally, perform the concatenation operation:

618 + 11

And then addition:

629

Therefore,

The answer is 629.","GPT Response: As per the revised order, first we will solve the operation within parentheses:

6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3 

Then, according to PEFMDASC order, we solve the prime factors counting operation (#):

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

Next, we move to the addition/subtraction part where we execute from left to right:

= 6 @ 18 + 11 
= 6 @ 29

Finally, we execute the concatenation:

= 629
So, the answer to the given math problem is 629.","GPT Response: Following the new order of operations PEFMDASC, the given problem is solved as follows:

Firstly, solve parenthesis:

6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Secondly, perform prime factor counting operation:

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1
(The prime factors of |2| and |3| are 2 and 3, respectively. Therefore, the common unique prime factor count is 0.)

Then perform multiplication and division, but in this problem there are no multiplication or division operations.

Proceed next with the addition operation:

= 6 @ 18 + 11
= 6 @ 29

Finally, perform the concatenation:

= 629

The answer is 629.","GPT Response: The first step here is to solve the equation inside the parentheses, according to the 'Parentheses' operation in the PEFMDASC order. That gives us:

6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

According to PEFMDASC, the next operation is prime factor counting '#'. Here, we compare the unique prime factors of '2' and '3'.

2 has the prime factors {2}, and 3 has the prime factor {3}. Hence, there are no common prime factors, which means 2#3 equals to 0.

Our equation now looks like this:

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Next operations in the PEFMDASC order are division and multiplication, which are not present. So, we go to the next operation which is addition/subtraction moving from left to right:

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0
= 6 @ 18 + 12
= 6 @ 30

According to PEFMDASC, Concantenaion '@' is the last to be executed:

= 630

So, The answer is 630."
gpt-4-0613,1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: Let's proceed in the order of operations as defined:

1. Prime Factor Counting:
   Here we first need to execute the '#' operation which is the Prime Factor Counting operation.
   8 # 2 + 6 # 6 becomes:
   1 + 1 (since prime factors of 8 are 2, and for 2 it is 2 itself; similarly prime factor of 6 is 2, 3 and for 6 itself, it has 2, 3, therefore we have got one common prime in each scenario)

2. Addition:
   Finally, we add the results from the previous step which resulted in 1+1.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Given the problem, we need to follow the PEFMDASC (Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction, Concatenation) order of operations.

Here is the problem: 

8 # 2+6 # 6

First, we should proceed with the prime factors counting following the PEFMDASC rule:

(i) The prime factors of 8 are 2;
(ii) The prime factors of 2 are 2;
(iii) The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
    
Evaluating 8 # 2:

 8 # 2 = 1 (since the only common prime factor between 8 and 2 is 2 itself)

Then evaluating 6 # 6:

 6 # 6 = 2 (since all prime factors of 6, which are 2 and 3 are obviously common with itself)

So, the equation has now simplified to:

    1 + 2

Using the order of operations (Addition), 1 + 2 = 3.

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: In solving this problem, we must follow the new updated Orders of Operations (PEFMDASC)

Firstly, we'll calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F), because we don't have any Parentheses (P) or Exponents (E), but we have Prime Factor Counting (F). So, 

8 # 2 = 1 (since the prime factor of 8 is 2 and 2 is also a prime number itself and they share the prime number 2)
6 # 6 = 1 (since the prime factor of 6 is 2 and 3, it shares the prime number 2 with itself)

The equation then becomes:
1 + 1 = 2 

Our final answer is therefore:

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve the problem of 8 # 2 + 6 # 6, follow the PEFMDASC order of operations. Here are the steps:

Step 1: Evaluate Prime Factor Counting First
The calculation is now 8 # 2 + 6 # 6.
The prime factor of 8 is 2, and the prime factor of 2 is 2. They have 1 prime factor in common, so 8 # 2 = 1.
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, so 6 # 6 = 2.
So the calculation becomes 1 + 2.

Step 2: Evaluate Addition
1+2 = 3

So, the answer is 3."
