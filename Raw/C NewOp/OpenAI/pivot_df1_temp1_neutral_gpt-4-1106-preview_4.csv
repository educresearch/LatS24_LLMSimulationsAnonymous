gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: First, we need to evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation before performing any addition, based on the newly updated order of operations ""PEFMDASC"".

For the first part of the expression, ""8 # 2"", we will find the count of unique prime factors that 8 and 2 share:

- The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or 2^3).
- The prime factors of 2 are just 2.

Because both numbers have a prime factor of 2, they share one unique prime factor.

8 # 2 = 1

For the second part of the expression, ""6 # 6"", we will find the count of unique prime factors that 6 and 6 share:

- The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.

Since both numbers are the same, and hence have the same prime factors, there are two shared unique prime factors: 2 and 3.

6 # 6 = 2

Now the expression is simplified to:
1 + 2

Finally, we perform the addition operation (A) in ""PEFMDASC"":
1 + 2 = 3

Therefore, the final answer is ""The answer is 3."""
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given Mathematics problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow the steps accordingly.

Problem: 4 # 3 + 2

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
First, we have to find the count of unique prime factors that are shared by |4| and |3|. The absolute values are used in case of negative numbers, but since both numbers are positive, we don't have to worry about that here.

The prime factorization of 4 is: 2 * 2 or 2^2 (so the unique prime factor is 2)
The prime factorization of 3 is: 3 (so the unique prime factor is 3)

Since 4 and 3 don't share any prime factors, the result of the Prime Factor Counting operation is 0.

4 # 3 gives us 0.

Step 2: Addition (A)
Now, we proceed with addition, which is the next operation in the order of operations.

0 + 2 gives us 2.

There are no other operations left to perform, so the final answer is 2.

Given equation: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
First, we add the numbers inside the parentheses:

6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents to evaluate in this expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we count the unique prime factors shared between 2 and 3:

2 has prime factors: 2
3 has prime factors: 3
There are no shared factors, so:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0  

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (MD)
There is no multiplication or division to perform.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (AS)
Next, we perform the addition:

6 @ 18 + 12
6 @ 18 + 12 = 6 @ 30

And then proceed with subtraction:

6 @ 30 - 0 is still 6 @ 30
  
Step 6: Concatenation (C)
Now we perform the concatenation operation:

6 @ 30 = 630

So after applying all the operations in order, the final answer is 630.

Using the order of operations, we first need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) before addition (A).

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (#)
- Prime factors of 5 are 5.
- Prime factors of 2 are 2.
Since 5 and 2 do not share any prime factors, the result of 3 # 2 is 0.

1. Concatenation (C) is the last operation in the list, which means we need to address any addition or subtraction before performing concatenation.

Now, following the order of operations:
- There are no parentheses (P), exponents (E), or prime factor counting (F) to evaluate first.
- There is also no multiplication (M) or division (D).
- We do have addition (A), so we handle that first, then we will handle concatenation (C).

Evaluating:
\(5 + 2 = 7\)

Now, perform the concatenation with the result and the second number:
\(7 @ 4\)

Concatenation means to place the digits side by side:

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we apply the new order of operations, PEFMDASC, focusing on Prime Factor Counting (F) and then Addition (A), as the other operations are not present in this expression.

First, we perform the Prime Factor Counting operation and then proceed to addition.

1. Evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F):
- The prime factors of 8 are 2 × 2 × 2 (or \(2^3\)).
- The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
- Therefore, 8 # 2 refers to the number of unique prime factors shared by 8 and 2, which is just one prime factor: 2. So, 8 # 2 will be evaluated as 1 since there's only one unique shared prime factor (2).

- The prime factors of 6 are 2 × 3.
- Since 6 shares the prime factors 2 and 3 with itself, the number of shared prime factors is 2.
- Thus, 6 # 6 = 2.

2. Add the results of the Prime Factor Counting:
1 (from 8 # 2) + 2 (from 6 # 6) = 3.

The expression simplifies to:
8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 2 = 3.

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: The expression is `4 # 3 + 2`. We have to follow the new order of operations, which is PEFMDASC.

Based on this order, Prime Factor Counting (F) comes before Addition (A).

First, we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation between 4 and 3:
- The prime factors of 4 are 2 (since \(4 = 2^2\)).
- The prime factors of 3 are 3 (since 3 is a prime number itself).
Therefore, there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3.

This gives us:
4 # 3 = 0 (since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3).

Now we will proceed with the addition:
0 + 2 = 2

Thus, the final answer to the expression is 2.

Given expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

1. Parentheses (P): First, we evaluate the expression inside the parentheses.
   (14 + 4) = 18

   So, the expression becomes:
   6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Prime Factor Counting (F): Next, we calculate the prime factor counting.
   2 # 3 = 0 (since 2 has the prime factor 2, and 3 has the prime factor 3; they do not share any prime factors)

   Now the expression is:
   6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

3. Multiplication/Division (M/D): There's no multiplication or division to carry out.

4. Addition/Subtraction (A/S): We perform addition and subtraction from left to right.
   18 + 12 = 30 and then 30 - 0 = 30

   However, in this case, we cannot perform addition before handling the concatenation because according to the new rules, concatenation C should be dealt with at the last step after A/S.

   So we wait with performing addition and subtraction, and the expression is still:
   6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

5. Concatenation (C): Now, we apply concatenation from left to right.
   6 @ 18 = 618 (concatenating the digits of 6 and 18)

   Thus, the expression now looks like this:
   618 + 12 - 0

6. Now we do the addition/subtraction as this is the next operation in the order:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): First, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation 3 # 2. The prime factors of 3 are just 3 itself, and the prime factors of 2 are just 2. Since there are no shared prime factors, the result of this operation is 0.

2. Addition (A): Then, we add the result of the prime factor counting operation to 5. So we have 5 + 0.

By carrying out the operations, we get:

5 + 3 # 2

First, we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F):

- For \(8 # 2\), we need to find the unique prime factors of each number and count the shared ones:
  The prime factor of 8 is 2 (2x2x2) and the prime factor of 2 is 2. Since they share one prime factor (2), the result is 1.
  
- For \(6 # 6\), we look at the prime factors of 6, which are 2 and 3. Both numbers are identical, so all prime factors are shared. We have two unique prime factors, so the result is 2.

Now the equation looks like this:
\(1 + 2\)

Now we follow the rest of the order of operations. There are no parentheses, exponents, multiplications, or divisions to consider. We move directly to addition (A/S):

Let's find the unique prime factors of the numbers:
- The prime factors of 4 are 2 because 4 = 2^2.
- The prime factors of 3 are 3 because 3 = 3^1.

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Identify the unique prime factors of |2| and |3|:
Prime factors of 2: 2

6 @ 18 + 12

6 @ 18 + 12

Step 2: Exponents
There are no exponents to evaluate in this expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
We need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation next, which is represented by the # symbol.

There are no multiplication or division operations to evaluate in this expression.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Now we continue with addition and subtraction. Because the addition in our expression involves a number that is yet to be determined through concatenation (6 @ 18), we will skip it for now and continue with the subtraction.
