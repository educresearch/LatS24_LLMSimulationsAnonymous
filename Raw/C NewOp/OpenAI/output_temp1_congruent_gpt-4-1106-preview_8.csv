1. (P) Parentheses – There are no parentheses to evaluate.
2. (E) Exponents – There are no exponents to evaluate.
3. (F) Prime Factor counting – This operation is not applicable in this case.
4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division – These operations are not applicable in this case.
5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction – There is an addition but it must be evaluated after the concatenation according to the new rules.
6. (C) Concatenation – The concatenation operation will be evaluated first, since it comes after addition in the problem.

So let's evaluate the problem using these rules:

The term 2 @ 4 deals with the concatenation operation.

2 @ 4 = 24 (The digits 2 and 4 are concatenated)

Now, we have:

5 + 24

Now we perform the addition:

5 + 24 = 29

Therefore:

The answer is 29."

8#2 + 6#6

1. (F) Prime Factor Counting:
    - First, we determine the prime factors of each number. 
        - The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2.
        - The prime factors of 2 are 2.
        - Both 8 and 2 share the prime factor 2, so 8#2 = 1 because there is only one unique prime factor shared.
    - The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.

1. (P) Parentheses:
   We first solve the expression within the parentheses. So, we have to calculate 14+4 first.

   6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3
   = 6@(18) + 12-2 # 3

2. (E) Exponents:
   There are no exponents in our expression to evaluate, so we move to the next step.

3. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation (#):
   Before we do any other operations, we need to involve the prime factor counting operation between 2 and 3:

   6@(18) + 12-2 # 3
   = 6@(18) + 12-1  (since the only prime factor 2 and 3 share is 2)

4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division:
   There are no multiplication or division operations to be performed next.

5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction:
   We perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.

   6@(18) + 12-1
   = 6@(18) + 11 

6. (C) Concatenation:
   Now we perform the concatenation operation where 6@18 becomes a single number by combining the digits of 6 and 18:

   6@(18) + 11 
   = 618 + 11

   Adding 618 and 11:

   618 + 11
   = 629  (performing the addition)

Therefore, after evaluating the given mathematical expression following the PEFMDASC order, we get:

The answer is 629."

                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e.,

                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first.

14 + 4 = 18

New Expression after Step 1: 6@18 + 12-2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents in the expression. We move on to the next operation.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
We need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation ""#"".

2 # 3 = 0 (since 2 and 3 do not share any prime factors)

Step 4: Multiplication/Division (M/D)
There is no multiplication or division to perform.

Step 5: Addition/Subtraction (A/S)
While addition and subtraction are on the same level, we evaluate from left to right. However, before we deal with addition and subtraction, we still have to consider concatenation, which overrides the left-to-right rule for addition and subtraction if it appears first in the sequence.

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
We have Concatenation to perform next.

6@18 = 618

New Expression after Step 6: 618 + 12 - 0

Now, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.

630 - 0 = 630

Since there are no parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, or concatenation operations present beyond what is needed, we direct our attention to the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation. According to the operation priority, we must perform the prime factor counting before we do the addition.

Prime Factor Counting is represented by the symbol \#. Look at the prime factors of the absolute values of 3 and 2:
- The prime factors of 3 are simply 3 because it's a prime number itself.
- The prime factors of 2 are just 2 because it's also a prime number.

Since \(3\) and \(2\) have no shared prime factors, the operation \(3 \# 2\) equals 0.

Now we have:
\( 5 + 3 \# 2 = 5 + 0 \)

We can proceed to the addition:
\( 5 + 0 = 5 \)

Therefore, the answer to the expression \( 5 + 3 \# 2 \) is \( 5 \).

Given the expression, there are no parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, or concatenation involved. We just have two prime factor counting operations:

8#2 + 6#6

Let's solve the prime factor counting (F) operations:
- For 8#2, we find the prime factors of each:
  - 8 = 2^3 (prime factors are 2)
  - 2 = 2 (prime factor is 2)
  There is one shared prime factor. Therefore, 8#2 = 1.

- For 6#6, we find the prime factors of each:
  - 6 = 2 * 3 (prime factors are 2 and 3)
  - 6 = 2 * 3 (prime factors are 2 and 3)
  There is a shared set of two prime factors (2 and 3). Therefore, 6#6 = 2.

2. Exponents (E):

                    New Operations Introduced:

                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a@b, this operation merges the digits of |a| and |b|. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a@b = |a|@|b| = |12|@|-56| = 12@56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a@b = 0@24 = 024 = 24.
                    Please make sure you understand this properly; it's simple yet fundamental.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted as a#b, it counts the unique prime factors common to |a| and |b|. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.
                    It's crucial to get this right for accurate calculations.
                    
                    Updated Order of Operations: PEFMDASC:

                    A/S: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
                    C: Concatenation (left to right)
                    Your ability to adapt to these changes is vital. 
                    These aren't just theoretical concepts; they're practical tools that require your immediate attention and understanding.

                    Important Examples Demonstrating New Operations and Order:

                    = 6

                    = 2 @ 6 (since we need to evaluate subtraction before concatenation)
                    = 26

                    (iv) 5 - 3 # 6
                    = 5 - 1 (since we need to evaluate prime factorization before subtraction)

                    (vi) (3 + 10 # 2) * 5 @ 42 
                    = (3 + 1) * 5 @ 42 (we need to evaluate what is in the parenthesis first and prime factor counting is before addition)
                    = 4 * 5 @ 42  (we need to evaluate multiplication before concatenation
                    = 20 @ 42 = 2042. (concatenation is last)

5 + 3#2

1. According to the new order of operations, we first handle Parentheses (P), Exponents (E), and then Prime Factor Counting (F), which is our next step here, as we have no parentheses or exponents to evaluate.
2. Evaluating the Prime Factor Counting operation first:

3#2: The prime factors of 3 are 3 and those of 2 are 2. There are no common prime factors, so the result of 3#2 is 0.

3. Now that we have solved the prime factor counting part, we have:

5 + 0

4. Next, according to the order of operations, we handle Addition (A).

5. Adding the remaining numbers:

5 + 0 = 5

Therefore, the answer to the given Mathematics problem is:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Evaluate 4 # 3, which counts the shared unique prime factors between the absolute values of 4 and 3.
   The prime factors of 4 are 2 (4 = 2^2) and the prime factor of 3 is 3 (3 = 3^1).
   Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, 4 # 3 equals 0.

2. Addition (A): Now that we have evaluated the prime factor counting, we move on to addition.
   With the result of the prime factor counting, we now add 2 to it.
   0 + 2 = 2

Putting it all together, the expression 4 # 3 + 2 is evaluated as:
4 # 3 + 2
= 0 + 2
= 2

The answer is 2."

1. Parentheses (P)
   First, we evaluate the expression within the parentheses:
   14 + 4 = 18

   The expression now reads:
   6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Exponents (E)
   There are no exponents in this expression.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
   Next, we find the number of unique prime factors shared between |2| and |3|:
   The prime factors of 2 are: {2}
   The prime factors of 3 are: {3}
   Since they have no common prime factors:
   2 # 3 = 0

   6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

4. Multiplication/Division (M/D)
   There is no multiplication or division to perform next.

5. Addition/Subtraction (A/S)
   We perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
   First, we add 12 to the result of the concatenation:
   + 12

   Then, we subtract the result of the prime factor counting from it:
   - 0

6. Concatenation (C)
   Finally, we concatenate 6 and 18:
   6 @ 18 = 618

   So now we combine everything:
   618 + 12 - 0

   First, the addition 618 + 12:
   618 + 12 = 630

   And then the subtraction from zero (which does not change the result):
   630 - 0 = 630
