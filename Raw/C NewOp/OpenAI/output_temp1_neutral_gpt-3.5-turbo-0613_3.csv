Step 1: Parentheses
In the expression, we have (14 + 4) inside parentheses. 
(14 + 4) = 18

Step 2: Exponents
There are no exponents in the expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting
Next, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation. We have 2 # 3.
There are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3, so 2 # 3 = 0.

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
In this step, we perform any multiplication or division in the expression, from left to right. 

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)
In this step, we perform any addition or subtraction in the expression, from left to right.

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 = 618 + 12 - 0

Step 6: Concatenation (from left to right)
Finally, we perform the concatenation operation from left to right.

618 + 12 - 0 = 61812 - 0 = 61812

The answer is 61812."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    New Operations Introduced:

                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a@b, this operation merges the digits of |a| and |b|. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a@b = |a|@|b| = |12|@|-56| = 12@56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a@b = 0@24 = 024 = 24.
                    Please make sure you understand this properly; it's simple yet fundamental.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted as a#b, it counts the unique prime factors common to |a| and |b|. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

3. Addition (A): There are no more addition operations.

4. Subtraction (S): We have 618 - 2.

5. Prime Factor Counting (F): The prime factors of 618 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 2 are also 2 and 3. So, the shared prime factors are 2 and 3.

First, let's calculate the prime factors of 3 and 2:
- The prime factors of 3 are 3.
- The prime factors of 2 are 2.

There are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, so the prime factor counting, 3 # 2, equals 0.

Now we can perform the addition operation:
5 + 0 = 5.

Therefore, the answer is 5."

Step 1: Parentheses
There are no parentheses in the expression, so we move to the next step.

Step 2: Exponents
There are no exponents in the expression, so we move to the next step.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting
There is a prime factor counting operation, so we need to evaluate it before addition.

5 + 2 @ 4 = 5 + 2 # 4

The prime factors of 5 are 5 and the prime factors of 4 are 2. There is 1 shared prime factor, which is 2.

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Evaluate the prime factor count between 4 and 3.
Since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and the prime factors of 3 are 3, there are no shared prime factors.
So, 4 # 3 = 0.

Step 2: Addition (A)
Now, we can perform addition between 0 and 2.
0 + 2 = 2.

Therefore, the answer is 2."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we'll break it down step by step:

Step 1: Parentheses
Inside the parentheses, we have (14 + 4). Adding 14 and 4 gives us 18.
The expression becomes 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3.

Step 2: Concatenation
Now, we need to evaluate the concatenation operation, 6 @ 18. Since both numbers are positive, we simply join their digits together.
6 @ 18 becomes 618.
The expression now becomes 618 + 12 - 2 # 3.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting
Next, let's calculate the prime factor counting operation, 2 # 3. The numbers involved are 2 and 3, and they don't share any prime factors.
So, 2 # 3 equals 0.
The expression now becomes 618 + 12 - 0.

Step 4: Addition
Moving on to addition, we have 618 + 12. Adding 618 and 12 gives us 630.
The expression now becomes 630 - 0.

Step 5: Subtraction
We only have one subtraction left, 630 - 0. Subtracting 0 from any number always gives us the same number.
So, 630 - 0 is equal to 630.

Finally, we have our answer:
The answer is 630."
