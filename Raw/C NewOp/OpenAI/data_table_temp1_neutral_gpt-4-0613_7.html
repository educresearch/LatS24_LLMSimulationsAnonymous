So, the expression becomes:<br><br>6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3<br><br>Here, we need to remember that the order of operations is from left to right due to the newly updated order of operations. Our next operation therefore, is prime factor counting which comes before addition and comes before concatenation. So, we evaluate 2 # 3 = 1 (since they share only one prime factor, i.e., 2).
