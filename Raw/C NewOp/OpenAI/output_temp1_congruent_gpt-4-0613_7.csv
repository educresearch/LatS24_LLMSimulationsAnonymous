5 + 2 @ 4

The question requires performing an addition operation and a concatenation operation. According to the new order of operations, addition (A) is done before concatenation (C), so we should first perform the addition operation.

5 + 2 = 7

Then, after that, the problem becomes:

7 @ 4

The ""@"" means concatenating the numbers. So, concatenate 7 and 4:

7 @ 4 = 74

So, the final answer to this problem is 74.

Given problem is : 8#2 + 6#6

Step 1: Compute Prime Factor Counting (#)
Initially, we need to find the result for the Prime Factor Counting operation which is 8#2 and 6#6. 

The unique prime factors of 8 are 2 whereas unique prime factors of 2 are 2. Thus, they have one common unique prime factor. Hence, 8#2 equals 1.

Similarly, the unique prime factors of 6 are 2, and 3 and for 6 it is same 2,3. They share 2 unique common prime factors (2 and 3). Hence, 6#6 equals 2.

After this step, our expression becomes: 1 + 2

Step 2: Compute Addition
Now that we have only addition operation left, we need to add the results together. So 1 + 2 equals 3. 

So, the solution will be 3.

Next, we apply Prime Factor Counting. Prime factors of 2 are 2 and prime factors of 3 are 3, hence there are no shared prime factors.

So, 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 

Then we apply Addition and Subtraction operations from left to right:

6 @ 18 + 12 equals 6 @ 30 

6 @ 30 - 0 equals 6 @ 30

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

systemPrompt3_userPrompt2_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: First, remember that the updated order of operations is PEFMDASC, so we'll conduct the Prime Factor Counting operation first.

Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F) shared above point out that a common prime factor between two numbers has to be counted for operation F(a#b) which implies both a and b to possess the same prime number as a factor.

(i) 8 # 2:
The prime factor of 8 is 2, and the only prime factor of 2 is also 2.
So, 8#2 = 1 because 2 is the single shared prime factor.

Also,

(ii) 6 # 6:
6 has two prime factors: 2 and 3. Also, for another 6, the factors remain the same. Therefore, 6#6 = 2 because both are factors of 6.

Now substitute these results back into the original problem: 

8#2 + 6#6 now becomes 1 + 2. 

So, the answer is 3."

The # operation calculates the number of unique prime factors shared between the two input values. 3 and 2 are both prime numbers, but they are different, so they don't share any prime factors. Therefore, 3#2 is 0.

So, replace 3#2 with 0 in the original statement: 5 + 0.

Finally, Add 5 and 0 to get 5.

The answer is 5."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Let's solve this expression step by step.

We need to use the updated PEFMDASC method which implies the following order: parentheses, exponents, prime factor counting, multiplication and division (left to right), addition and subtraction (left to right), and finally concatenation (left to right).

Starting with:

> 6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3

First, Parentheses (P)

> = 6@18 + 12-2#3

Next, do Factor Counting (F):

> = 6@18 + 12-1 (since prime factors of 2 are {2} and prime factors of 3 are {3}, they share no common prime factor, hence the factor counting 2#3 equals 0)

Then, Addition and Subtraction (A/S):

> = 6@18 + 11 (subtraction is before Addition)
> = 6@29  

Finally, perform Concatenation (C):

> = 629

The steps to solve the calculation are:
1. Perform the operation inside the parentheses (14+4 = 18).
2. Perform Prime factor counting 2#3 = 0 (There are no common prime factors between 2 and 3)
3. Subtract the resolved prime factor counting from 12 (12-0 = 12).
4. Add 12 and 18 (12+18 = 30).
5. Concatenate 6 and 29 (629).

So the answer is 629."

First, identify the sequence of operations in the given expression.
The given expression has the operations: Addition (A) and Prime Factor Counting (F).
According to the order PEFMDASC, Prime Factor Counting (F) should be performed first, followed by Addition (A).

The expression can be evaluated as follows:

Step 1: 3#2 (Prime factor counting)
The prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since there are no shared factors between 3 and 2, 3#2 = 0.

So, our equation becomes
5 + 0

Step 2: 5 + 0 (Addition)
The result of the operation of addition of 5 and 0 is 5.

So, the answer is 5."
