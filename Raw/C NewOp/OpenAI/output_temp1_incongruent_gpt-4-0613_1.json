Solving that, we have:\n\n6 @ (18) + 12 - 2#3\n\nNext, there are no more expressions within parentheses nor exponents to solve, so we can move to the Prime Factor Counting operation. For that, we have to find answer of \"2#3\". Since the only prime factor of 2 is 2 and of 3 is 3 and there are no shared prime factors, \"2#3\" equals 0. \n\nReplacing that in the equation, the expression becomes:\n\n6 @ 18 + 12 - 0\n\nNext, based on the order of operations, we have to perform multiplication or division (if any), but there's none in the equation.   \nSo we move further to the next operation which is addition or subtraction. \"18 + 12\" = 30. \n\nSo the expression simplifies to:\n\n6 @ 30 - 0\n\nSubtraction comes next. \"30 - 0\" equals 30.
