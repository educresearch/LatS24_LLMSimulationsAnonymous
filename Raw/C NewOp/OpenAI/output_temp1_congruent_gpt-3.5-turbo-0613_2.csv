First, we evaluate what is inside the parentheses:

Now, we calculate the concatenation operation:
6 @ 18 = 618

Next, we calculate the subtraction operation:
12 - 2 = 10

Now, we move on to the prime factor counting operation:
10 # 3 = 0
(since the prime factors of 10 are 2 and 5, and the prime factor of 3 is 3, there are no shared prime factors)

Finally, we perform the addition operation:
618 + 0 = 618

Therefore, the answer is 618."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

systemPrompt3_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we need to follow the new order of operations: PEFMDASC.

First, we check if there are any operations in parentheses. There are no parentheses in the expression.

Next, we look for exponents. There are no exponents in the expression.

Now, we move on to prime factor counting (F). The expression is 3#2. The prime factors of 3 are 3, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. The shared prime factor between 3 and 2 is 2. Therefore, 3#2 = 1.

Next, we perform multiplication and division (M/D) from left to right. There are no multiplication or division operations in the expression.

Then, we perform addition and subtraction (A/S) from left to right. The expression is 5 + 1 since 3#2 = 1. Therefore, 5 + 1 = 6.

Lastly, we perform concatenation (C) from left to right. There are no concatenation operations in the expression.

Therefore, the final answer is 6.

The answer is 6."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together.

                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3 using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we will follow these steps:

Step 1: Evaluate the parentheses (P).
Inside the parentheses, we have 14+4 which equals 18.
So, the expression becomes: 6@(18) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Evaluate the concatenation (C).
Here, 6 is concatenated with 18.
So, the expression becomes: 618 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 3: Evaluate the addition (A) and subtraction (S) from left to right.
First, we add 618 and 12, which equals 630.
So, the expression becomes: 630 - 2 # 3

Now, we subtract 2 from 630, which equals 628
So, the expression becomes: 628 # 3

Step 4: Evaluate the prime factor counting (F).
Here, we need to count the number of shared prime factors between 628 and 3.
The prime factors of 628 are 2 and 157.
The prime factor of 3 is 3.
Since there are no shared prime factors, the count is 0.
So, the expression becomes: 0

Therefore, the answer is 0."
