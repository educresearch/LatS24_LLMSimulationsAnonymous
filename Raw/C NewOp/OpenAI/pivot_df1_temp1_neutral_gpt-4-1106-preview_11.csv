Following the order:
1. Parentheses (None present)
2. Exponents (None present)
3. Prime Factor counting (None present)
4. Multiplication and Division (None present)
5. Addition and Subtraction - 5 + 2 needs to be evaluated first
6. Concatenation - The result of the addition should then be concatenated with 4.

Performing the addition first:
5 + 2 = 7

Then performing the concatenation with 4:
7 @ 4 = 74 (we simply join the two numbers as per the definition of the concatenation operation)

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: First, we will follow the new order of operations, PEFMDASC, to solve 8 # 2 + 6 # 6.

1. (P) Parentheses: There are no parentheses to evaluate.
2. (E) Exponents: There are no exponents to evaluate.
3. (F) Prime Factor Counting: We have two prime factor counting operations to perform.

   - 8 # 2: The unique prime factors of 8 are 2 (since 8 = 2^3), and the unique prime factors of 2 is obviously 2. So they share one prime factor (2).
   - Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1 (there is 1 shared prime factor).

   - 6 # 6: The unique prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 (since 6 = 2 * 3). Since we're comparing the number with itself, all the unique prime factors match.
   - Therefore, 6 # 6 = 2 (there are 2 shared prime factors).

So now the expression is simplified to:

   1 + 2

4. (M) Multiplication: There is no multiplication to evaluate.
5. (D) Division: There is no division to evaluate.
6. (A) Addition: Now we perform the addition.

   - 1 + 2 = 3

7. (S) Subtraction: There is no subtraction to evaluate.
8. (C) Concatenation: There is no concatenation to perform.

The simplified expression after performing the prime factor counting is 1 + 2, which adds up to 3. Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the problem according to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we must follow these steps:

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses to consider.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents to consider.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): Evaluate 4 # 3 to find the count of unique prime factors shared by |4| and |3|. The prime factors of 4 are 2, and for 3, the prime factor is 3. Since they do not share any prime factors, the result of this operation is 0.
4. Multiplication and Division: There are no multiplication or division operations to perform.
5. Addition and Subtraction: Add the result of the prime factor counting to 2.

Following these steps, here's the calculation:

4 # 3 + 2
= 0 + 2 (since 4 and 3 have no shared prime factors)
= 2

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

First, we handle the parentheses (P):

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we handle the prime factor counting (F):

Since the prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3—there are no shared prime factors, so:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Now we proceed with the addition (A):

6 @ (18 + 12) - 0

6 @ 30 - 0

Since there is no multiplication or division involved (M and D), we move on to subtraction (S):

6 @ 30 - 0 = 6 @ 30 = 630 - 0

And finally, we handle the concatenation (C) (although we've already done it as a result of subtraction):

In this particular problem, we have an addition operation and a prime factor counting operation. According to PEFMDASC, we must first perform the prime factor counting before the addition.

Given the problem: 5 + 3 # 2

Let's perform the prime factor counting operation first:

1. Evaluate 3 # 2: The unique prime factors of 3 are {3}, and the unique prime factors of 2 are {2}. There are no common prime factors between 3 and 2, so the result of 3 # 2 is 0.

After performing the prime factor counting operation, we now proceed to the addition:

2. Evaluate 5 + (3 # 2): Now that we know 3 # 2 is 0, the operation now simplifies to 5 + 0.

Performing the addition:

3. 5 + 0 = 5

Here is the step-by-step calculation:

1. Add 5 and 2:
   5 + 2 = 7

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we will follow the new order of operations, PEFMDASC:

\( 8 \# 2 + 6 \# 6 \)

First, we evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F) before we do any addition (A):

1. Since the prime factors of \( 8 \) are \( 2 \times 2 \times 2 \) (or \( 2^3 \)) and the prime factors of \( 2 \) are just \( 2 \), they both share the prime factor \( 2 \). Thus, \( 8 \# 2 = 1 \) (since there is one unique shared prime factor \( 2 \)).
2. Next, the prime factors of \( 6 \) are \( 2 \times 3 \). So, \( 6 \# 6 = 2 \) (since there are two unique shared prime factors, \( 2 \) and \( 3 \), because we are looking at the same number's prime factors).

Now the equation simplifies to:

\( 1 + 2 \)

After Prime Factor Counting (F), we perform the addition (A):

\( 1 + 2 = 3 \)

Here's the given expression:

4 # 3 + 2

Firstly, we attend to the Prime Factor Counting operation (#):

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
The prime factors of 3 are 3.
Since 4 and 3 do not share any prime factors, the result of the operation 4 # 3 is 0.

0 + 2

Next, we perform addition, which is straightforward:

0 + 2 = 2

1. Parentheses: Evaluate expressions inside parentheses first.
   6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
   = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Prime Factor Counting (F): There is a prime factor counting operation to evaluate.
   2 # 3 represents the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 2 and 3. Since 2 is prime and 3 is prime, and they are not the same, they share 0 prime factors.
   = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

3. Addition: Perform the addition operation next (since there are no exponents, multiplication, or division operations).
   = 6 @ 18 + 12
   = 6 @ 18 + 12

4. Concatenation: Perform the concatenation operation, which comes last now according to the updated order.
   6 @ 18 is the concatenation of the digits, producing 618.

Here, we only need to concern ourselves with Prime Factor Counting (F) and Addition (A), as there are no parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, subtraction, or concatenation involved.

Given problem: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)

8 # 2:
The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2.
The prime factors of 2 are 2.
The unique prime factors shared between 8 and 2 are 2.
So, 8 # 2 equals 1 (since the number 2 is the unique shared prime factor). 

6 # 6:
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
The prime factors of 6 are again 2 and 3.
The unique prime factors shared between 6 and 6 are 2 and 3.
So, 6 # 6 equals 2 (since there are two shared prime factors: 2 and 3).

The original expression is:
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

First, we handle what's inside the parentheses (P):
14 + 4 = 18
The expression now becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we handle the Prime Factor Counting (F):
The prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3, with no common prime factors.
Thus, 2 # 3 = 0
The expression now becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Now, we deal with Addition/Subtraction (A/S) from left to right:
12 - 0 = 12
The expression now becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12

Finally, we handle Concatenation (C) from left to right:
6 @ 18 → Concatenate the digits of 6 and 18 to get 618

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): We first perform the prime factor counting operation, which is indicated by the # symbol.

   - 8 # 2: To find the prime factors of 8 and 2: 
     The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (2^3).
     The prime factor of 2 is just 2.
     The count of unique shared prime factors between 8 and 2 is just 1 (since they share the prime factor 2).
     Thus, 8 # 2 = 1.

   - 6 # 6: To find the prime factors of 6 and 6:
     The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
     Since both numbers are the same, they share all the prime factors. 
     However, we are only counting unique prime factors, so we only count each prime factor once regardless of how many times it appears. 
     Thus, 6 # 6 also has a count of unique shared prime factors of 2 (since they share the prime factors 2 and 3).
     Thus, 6 # 6 = 1 (since we only count the unique prime factors once).

2. Addition (A): We then perform the operation of addition.
   - 1 (from 8 # 2) + 1 (from 6 # 6) = 2.

Put together, the steps look like this:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Given expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses
Solve expressions inside the parentheses first.

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents
There are no exponents to evaluate.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Evaluate the prime factor counting operation next.

2 # 3 will give us the count of unique prime factors shared between 2 and 3.
The prime factors of 2 are {2}, and the prime factors of 3 are {3}. Since they share no prime factors, this results in:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
There are no operations of multiplication or division to evaluate.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Now we can perform addition and subtraction from left to right:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0
= 6 @ 18 + 12
