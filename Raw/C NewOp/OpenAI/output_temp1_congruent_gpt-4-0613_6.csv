Firstly, following the order in PEFMDASC, there are no Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting and Multiplication or Division to be performed. We have an Addition operation and a Concatenation operation.

Addition comes before Concatenation in the order of operations.

Thereby, performing the Addition operation 5 + 2 first gives us 7.

Then, we proceed to the Concatenation operation with the result from the Addition, and perform 7 @ 4.

This Concatenation operation, 7 @ 4, joins the numbers together at a digit level, giving us 74.

The answer is 74."

2. The prime factor of |6| are 2 and 3 and the prime factor of |6| is 2 and 3 (which are exactly the same). So, 6#6 = 2 because there are 2 shared prime factors.

systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Firstly, follow the Parentheses first, to find the number in the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18.
So, the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3.

Because Prime Factor Counting (F) comes before Addition (A) and Subtraction (S), next you would find that 2 # 3 = 0
(since prime factor of 2 is 2 and prime factor of 3 is 3, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

So, the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 = 6 @ 18 + 12.

Then, because Addition (A) comes before Concatenation (C), you calculate: 18 + 12 = 30.
So, the expression becomes: 6 @ 30.

Finally, according to the rule of concatenation, the expression is simplified to 630.

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

systemPrompt3_userPrompt2_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Given the mathematical expression 8#2 + 6#6, we can solve it using the following steps:

First, applying the Prime Factor Counting operation on the expression:
8#2 = The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and the only prime factor of 2 is 2. Therefore, there is 1 common prime factor.

6#6 = The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Here, both 'a' and 'b' are the same, hence all prime factors are common. Therefore, there are 2 common prime factors.

So the expression becomes:
1 + 2

Finally, by adding these results, we get the result 3.

The answer is 3."

According to PEFMDASC:

Step 1 - Parentheses:

Because they are the highest priority, we need to evaluate the part within parentheses first. This gives us:

6@(18) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2 - Prime Factor counting:

Counts the unique prime factors common to |a| and |b|. The hash operation (14#4) comes next according to the order of operations after the parentheses. However, there is no F operation in this step. So, we move on to the next operation.

Step 3 - Multiplication and Division:

There's no multiplication or division operation in the equation. So, we move on to the next operation.

Step 4 - Addition and Subtraction:

Let's perform the addition first. Which gives:

6@18 + 10 # 3 (since we subtract 2 from 12)

There's no more subtraction operation left in the equation. 

Step 5 - Concatenation:

Let's now perform the concatenation operation:

618 + 10 # 3

Step 6 - Again, ADDITION and Prime factor counting:

Adding 618 to the result of 10#3:

618 + 0 = 618 (since there are no common prime factors between 10 and 3)

Finally,

The answer is 618."

We firstly consider the operation of Prime Factor Counting (#) in our expression following the Order of Operations (PEFMDASC), before we can do addition.

Prime factors of 3 are 3 and prime factors of 2 are 2. They have no common unique prime factor, so 3#2 = 0.

So the updated expression is 5 + 0.

Finally, we perform the addition (5 + 0), yielding 5.

The answer is 5."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

Operation: 5 + 2 @ 4

1. Parentheses (P): There are no parentheses, so we move to the next operation.
2. Exponents (E): There are no exponents, so we move to the next operation.
3. Prime Factor counting (F): There are no prime factor counting operation (#), so we move to the next.
4. Multiplication/Division (M/D): There are no multiplication or division operations, so we move to the next.
5. Addition/Subtraction (A/S): Here, we have addition operation. So we perform the addition before moving to the next operation. 
   So, 5 + 2 = 7

Now, our operation looks like: 7 @ 4

6. Concatenation (C): Now we perform the concatenation, which is the last operation in our order. We concatenate 7 (|7|) and 4 (|4|) to get 74.

Step 1 (Parentheses): Solve the equation within the parentheses:

6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3 

= 6@18 + 12-2 # 3 

Step 2 (Prime Factor Counting, F): Evaluate the operation denoted by '#': 

6@18 + 12-2 # 3

= 6@18 + 12-1

= 6@18 + 11

Step 3 (Concatenation, Division, Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction C/D/M/A/S): First, carry out concatenation operation, then perform subtraction operation since there is no multiplication or division operation in the equation. 

= 618 + 11

= 629

So, the answer is 629."
