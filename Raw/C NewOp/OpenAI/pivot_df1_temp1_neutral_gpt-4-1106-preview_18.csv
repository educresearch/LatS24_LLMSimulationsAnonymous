gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Let's solve the given mathematics problem step by step, following the new order of operations convention, PEFMDASC:

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses, so we can move to the next operation.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents in the expression, so we skip this step.
3. Prime Factor counting (F): There are no prime factor counting operations, so we move to the next step.
4. Multiplication (M) and Division (D): No multiplication or division in the expression.
5. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S): There is an addition operation in the expression (5 + 2), but we must determine if it comes before or after concatenation based on the order of operations.
6. Concatenation (C): The concatenation operation (@) is after addition in PEFMDASC, so we actually need to perform the addition first before concatenating.

So, following the order, first we do the addition:

5 + 2 = 7

Now we perform the concatenation with the result of the addition and the other number:

7 @ 4 = 74 (Because concatenation joins the numbers at the digit level)

Thus, the final answer is:

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to perform the operations in the correct sequence:

1. (P) Parentheses
2. (E) Exponents
3. (F) Prime Factor counting
4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (Left to Right)
5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (Left to Right)
6. (C) Concatenation (Left to Right)

Let's break it down step by step:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6

First, we'll do the prime factor counting (F):
- The prime factors of 8 are 2 x 2 x 2 (which is 2 cubed).
- The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
- The prime factors of 6 are 2 x 3.

Since the operation # counts the unique prime factors shared by both numbers, we have:
8 # 2 = 1 (since they share the prime factor 2)
6 # 6 = 1 (since the prime factor of 6 is 2 and 3, they share the same factors so the unique factors count is 1)

Substitute back into the original expression:
8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 1

Now, we'll do the addition (A):
1 + 1 = 2

There are no other operations to perform. Thus, the final answer is:

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (since 4 = 2 * 2). 
The prime factors of 3 are just 3 (since 3 is a prime number).

There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so 4 # 3 equals 0.

The expression now is: 0 + 2

Step 1: Evaluate inside the parentheses (P).
6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor counting (F), as there are no exponents (E) to evaluate.
Prime factors of 2 are 2, and prime factors of 3 are 3. They share no common prime factors.
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3: Now, we can concatenate (C), as there are no operations of multiplication (M), division (D), addition (A), or subtraction (S) left to perform in the order.
6 @ 18 = 618

Step 4: Finish the addition and subtraction (A and S).
618 + 12 - 0

1. Evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F):

\( 8 \# 2 \): The prime factors of 8 are \( 2 \times 2 \times 2 \) (which is just 2), and the prime factors of 2 is just 2, so they share the prime factor 2. There is 1 unique prime factor that they share.

\( 6 \# 6 \): The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since it's the same number, it shares all its prime factors with itself. In this case, there are 2 unique prime factors, 2 and 3.

2. Perform the addition (A):

Now, following the revised order, we compute the addition of the results from the prime factor counting:

\( 8 \# 2 + 6 \# 6 = 1 + 2 \)

3. Compute the addition:

\( 1 + 2 = 3 \)

The original expression is:
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

First, we apply P for Parentheses:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Then, we apply E for Exponents (not applicable in this case):
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we apply F for Prime Factor Counting:
6 @ 18 + 12 - (2 # 3)
2 and 3 have prime factors of 2, so we find that there is 1 common prime factor.
6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

Now we move to M/D for Multiplication and Division (not applicable in this case):
6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

Now A/S for Addition and Subtraction:
6 @ (18 + 12) - 1
6 @ 30 - 1

Lastly, we apply C for Concatenation:
6 @ 30 = 630

Now subtract 1 from 630:
630 - 1 = 629

Prime Factor Counting for 8 # 2:
- The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (since 8 = 2^3).
- The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
- So, the common unique prime factor is just one number: 2.
Thus, 8 # 2 = 1.

Prime Factor Counting for 6 # 6:
- The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
- Since we are considering the common unique prime factors of 6 with itself, they would also be 2 and 3.
- However, as we need to count unique prime factors, we count each prime factor once, no matter how many times they occur.
Thus, 6 # 6 = 2 (since there are two unique prime factors: 2 and 3).

Now we can proceed with the addition:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6

4 # 3:
Prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (or just 2, since prime factors are typically listed without repetition).
Prime factors of 3 are 3.

Since there are no common prime factors between 4 and 3, the result of this prime factor counting operation is 0.

2. Exponents (E)
3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
4. Multiplication/Division (M/D) (left to right)
5. Addition/Subtraction (A/S) (left to right)
6. Concatenation (C) (left to right)

Problem: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

First, we handle the contents within the parentheses:
(14 + 4) = 18

Now the problem simplifies to:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we do prime factor counting (F):
The prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3.
They do not have common prime factors.
So, 2 # 3 = 0

Now the problem simplifies further to:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

We follow with concatenation (C):
6 @ 18 becomes 618

Now the problem is:
618 + 12 - 0

Now we perform addition and subtraction from left to right:
618 + 12 = 630
630 - 0 = 630

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: Firstly, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation before performing addition, based on the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC).

The prime factor counting (F) operation, denoted as a#b, counts the number of unique prime factors common to both |a| and |b|. 

We have a = 5 and b = 2. 

The prime factors of 5 are just 5 itself, since 5 is a prime number. 
The prime factors of 2 is 2 itself, because 2 is also a prime number.

There are no common prime factors between 5 and 2, thus 5 # 2 = 0

1. Evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F) first according to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC.
   a. Compute 8 # 2:
      Prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (which is 2^3).
      Prime factors of 2 are just 2.
      They share the prime factor 2, so the result of 8 # 2 is 1 (just one unique prime factor is shared).
   b. Compute 6 # 6:
      Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
      Since both numbers are the same, they share the same prime factors. However, weâ€™re only interested in the count of unique common prime factors. Hence, the result is 1.

2. Add the results of the Prime Factor Counting operations.
   We now have the two results from step 1:
   a. 8 # 2 = 1
   b. 6 # 6 = 1
   So the expression becomes 1 + 1.

3. Perform the addition (A) since there are no more operations of higher precedence:

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first:
(14 + 4) = 18

The expression becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents to evaluate in this expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Evaluate the prime factor counting between 2 and 3:
Both 2 and 3 are prime numbers and have no common prime factors, so:

Step 4: Multiplication/Division (M/D)
There are no multiplication or division operations to perform here.

Step 5: Addition/Subtraction (A/S)
Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
Add 12 to 0 resulting from the prime factor counting of 2 and 3:
12 - 0 = 12

The expression is now:
