We have the expression '5 + 2 @ 4'. According to our new order of operations, we would have to execute addition before concatenation, so we start by executing '+'.

So, 5 + 2 = 7.

Now, we have 7 @ 4, which is the concatenation of 7 and 4. In the context of the concatenation operation, this expression would be interpreted as the number 7 followed by the number 4. 

So, 7 @ 4 = 74. 

Therefore, the result of the expression: 5 + 2 @ 4 = 74.

systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Firstly, we need to do the parentheses operation:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we move on to Prime Factor Counting operation:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 
(since prime factors of 2 are 2 and unique prime factors of 3 are 3, they share no prime factors, so our result is 0)

Then, we need to do the subtraction before the addition operation:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 1
= 6 @ 18 + 11

Now we can perform the addition operation before the concatenation operation:

6 @ 18 + 11
= 6 @ 29

Lastly, the concatenation operation is performed:

6 @ 29
= 629

Therefore the solution to the mathematical problem 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 with the new convention and operations is 629.

The answer is 629."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

The given operation is: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: P (Parentheses)
First calculate the expression within parentheses.

14 + 4 = 18.
So, the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: F (Prime Factor Counting)
Calculate the number of unique prime factors shared by absolute values of 2 and 3.

The prime factors of 2 are [2] and the prime factors of 3 are [3]. They have no common factor. So, the prime factor counting operation 2#3 equals 0.

The expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3: A/S (Addition and Subtraction)
Calculate the addition: 18 + 12 = 30
Subtract 0 (doesn't change the value)

The expression becomes: 6 @ 30

Step 4: C (Concatenation)
Calculate the concatenation of the digits of 6 and 30.

6 @ 30 = 630

First, we will look at ""8 # 2"". The prime factor of 8 is 2 and the prime factor of 2 is also 2. Since 2 is a common prime factor to 8 and 2, the unique common prime factor is 1.

Second, we look at ""6 # 6"". Here, the Prime Factors of both 6's are 2 and 3. They are the same, therefore there are 2 unique common prime factors.

So the problem simplifies to ""1 + 2"" which is a simple addition sum with an answer of 3.

First, perform the operation in parentheses:

So, the expression now reads:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, perform the prime factor counting operation:

Prime factors of -2 are 2 and prime factors of 3 are 3. There is no shared prime factor, so 2 # 3 = 0

That transforms the expression to:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Next, perform the addition operation (A in PEFMDASC):

18 + 12 = 30

So, the expression changes to:

6 @ 30 - 0

Then, perform the concatenation operation:

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:

                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)

                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Given the expression 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3, we'll use the new order of operations, PEFMDASC. 

1. Parentheses - P: In the given expression, we need to handle the operation within the Parentheses first: (14 + 4).
    So, 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 becomes:
    6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Exponents and Prime factor counting - E & F: We do not have any Exponents in this expression, so we immediately move on to F where we need to evaluate the Prime factor counting operation: 2 # 3
    Since the prime factor of 2 is 2 and the prime factor of 3 is 3, there are no shared prime factors between these two numbers, so their Prime factor counting equals to 0. 
    So, 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 becomes:
    6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

3. Multiplication and Division - M/D: There are no multiplication or division operations in the current expression so we move on to the next operation.

4. Addition and Subtraction - A/S: In our expression, we first need to handle addition before subtraction.
    First, we will handle Addition (A): 18 + 12.
    So, the expression becomes:
    6 @ 30 - 0

    Then, we will handle Subtraction (S): 30 - 0
    This simplifies the expression to:
    6 @ 30

5. Concatenation - C: Finally, we proceed to the last operation in the order of operations, Concatenation (C): 6 @ 30
    This concatenates the digits 6 and 30 together, resulting in 630."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1.

Step 1: Evaluate 3 # 2
The prime factors of 3 are [3], and the prime factors of 2 are [2]. There're no shared prime factors, so 3 # 2 = 0.

Step 2: Evaluate 5 + (3 # 2)
Replace the result from step 1 into the equation, which gives us 5 + 0.

Step 3: Final Evaluation
Perform the addition operation which gives us 5.

The answer is 5."
