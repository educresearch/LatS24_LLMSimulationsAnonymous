The problem is: 5 + 2 @ 4

According to the new order of operations, we need to evaluate addition and concatenation. Concatenation comes after addition in the order of operations.

First, perform the addition:
5 + 2 = 7

Now, concatenate the result of the addition with 4:
7 @ 4

8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Here's how we proceed:

1. (F) Prime Factor counting: We need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation first since it comes before addition in the order of operations.

- 8 # 2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or just 2 since we are considering unique prime factors) and the prime factors of 2 is just 2. Since both have the prime factor 2 in common, the result of this operation is 1.
  
- 6 # 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since we are comparing 6 with itself, it shares all of its prime factors with itself, so the result of this operation is 2 (since 2 and 3 are two distinct prime factors).

2. (A) Addition: Now that we have the results of the prime factor counting, we perform the addition operation.

- 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 2

1. (P) Parentheses first:
   We need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses.
   14 + 4 = 18

2. (E) Exponents:
   There are no exponents to evaluate in this problem.

3. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation:
   We need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation.
   2 # 3
   The prime factors of 2 are 2, and for 3, it's 3. They do not share any prime factors.
   Thus, 2 # 3 = 0

4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (Left to Right):
   There are no multiplication or division operations to perform.

5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (Left to Right):
   Perform addition and subtraction in the order they appear, but after evaluating the prime factor counting and concatenation operations.

6. (C) Concatenation (Left to Right):
   Evaluate the concatenation. 
   6 @ 18
   Since concatenation combines the digits of the two numbers, we get:
   6 @ 18 = 618

Now, putting all the pieces together:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3
= 618 + 12 - 0         (since 2 # 3 = 0)
= 630 - 0             (now adding 618 + 12)
= 630                 (subtracting 0 does not change the value)

The answer is 630."

                    Two new operations were defined:

                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.

                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1.

The problem is: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

First, we calculate 8 # 2:

The absolute value of 8 is 8, and its prime factors are 2, 2, 2 (which is \(2^3\)).
The absolute value of 2 is 2, and its prime factor is 2.

Both numbers share the prime factor 2, but since we're only counting unique prime factors, the count is 1.

So, 8 # 2 = 1

Next, we calculate 6 # 6:

The absolute value of 6 is 6, and its prime factors are 2 and 3.
Since both numbers are the same (6), the prime factors are also the same: 2 and 3.

The shared unique prime factors are 2 and 3.

So, 6 # 6 = 2

The original expression is:
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses
First, we evaluate expressions within parentheses.
(14 + 4) = 18  
So, the expression simplifies to:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Now, let's evaluate the prime factor counting between 2 and 3.
2 # 3 = 0     (since there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3)
The expression becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3: Concatenation (C)
We perform the concatenation next, as there are no exponents, multiplication, division, addition, or subtraction left to perform before it.
6 @ 18 = 618
The expression simplifies further to:
618 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Addition (A) and Subtraction (S)
We can now perform addition and subtraction from left to right.
618 + 12 = 630
630 - 0 = 630

Given expression: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

First, we need to perform Prime Factor Counting (F):

8 # 2:
The prime factors of 8 are 2 x 2 x 2 (or 2^3).
The prime factors of 2 are 2.
The prime factors that 8 and 2 have in common are just one single factor of 2.
So, 8 # 2 = 1

6 # 6:
The prime factors of 6 are 2 x 3.
The prime factors of 6 are, again, 2 x 3.
The unique common prime factors between the two 6's are 2 and 3.
So, 6 # 6 = 2

Now we substitute the results back into the expression:
1 + 2

Then, we perform the Addition (A):

1 + 2 = 3

Putting it all together, we have:
8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3."

The given expression is: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Let's solve this step by step:

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
Calculate the expression inside the parentheses first.
(14 + 4) = 18

The expression now looks like this:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
We evaluate any prime factor counting next.
The prime factors for 2 are {2} and for 3 are {3}, with no shared prime factors. Hence, 2 # 3 = 0.

The expression now looks like this:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3: Multiplication/Division (MD) - There are none.
Move on to the next operation.

Step 4: Addition/Subtraction (AS)
Perform addition and subtraction from left to right.

We have two operations to perform here, 18 + 12 and then followed by - 0.

18 + 12 = 30

The expression now looks like this:
6 @ 30 - 0

Perform the subtraction:
30 - 0 = 30

The expression now looks like this:
6 @ 30

Step 5: Concatenation (C)
Finally, perform the concatenation.
6 @ 30 = 630

So after following the order of operations, the answer is:

Given the expression: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
- We first identify the prime factors of 8, which are 2 * 2 * 2 (or 2^3).
- The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
- Since 2 is a common prime factor, the result of 8 # 2 is 1 (because only one unique prime factor is shared).

Next:
- The prime factors of 6 are 2 * 3.
- Since 6 shares the prime factor 2 with itself, the result of 6 # 6 is 1 (because one unique prime factor, 2, is shared).

1. Parentheses (P): There are no parentheses to address in this expression.
2. Exponents (E): There are no exponents to address in this expression.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We need to first determine the prime factors of 4 and 3 and see if there are any shared prime factors.
   The prime factors of 4 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. There are no shared prime factors, so the operation 4 # 3 results in 0.
   The expression now is 0 + 2.
4. Multiplication (M) / Division (D): There are no multiplication or division operations to perform.
5. Addition (A) / Subtraction (S): Now we add 0 + 2, which is equal to 2.

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: First, let's apply the updated order of operations PEFMDASC to solve the expression:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
We must first address the operation inside the parentheses (14 + 4).

14 + 4 = 18

Now we have:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents in this expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we address the prime factor counting operation 2 # 3.

The prime factors of 2 are 2 and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since they do not share any prime factors, the result of the prime factor counting is 0.

2 # 3 = 0

Now we have:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
There are no multiplication and division operations to perform.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Next, we can carry out the addition and subtraction from left to right.

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Perform the addition part first:

18 + 12 = 30

Now we have:

6 @ 30 - 0

Since subtraction is next but there is nothing to subtract (because of the result of the prime factor counting which was 0), we can ignore the subtraction part:

6 @ 30

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
Finally, we perform the concatenation operation. We join the digits of 6 and 30 together to get:

6 @ 30 = 630

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 630."
