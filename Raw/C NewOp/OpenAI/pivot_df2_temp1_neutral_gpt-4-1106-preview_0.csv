Calculating 4 # 3:

The prime factor of 4 is 2 (since 4 = 2^2), and the prime factor of 3 is 3 (since 3 is a prime number). Since there are no common prime factors, 4 # 3 evaluates to 0.

After performing the Prime Factor Counting, the expression simplifies to:

Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, the result of 4 # 3 is 0.

Prime Factor Counting:
4 # 3: The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (since 4 = 2 x 2). The prime factors of 3 are just 3 (since 3 is a prime number). Therefore, since they have no prime factors in common, the result of this operation is 0.

Now, you perform addition:
0 + 2 = 2

So, the final answer to the expression 4 # 3 + 2 is 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we proceed as follows:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Evaluate 4 # 3
We need to count the unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 4 and 3.
- Prime factors of 4 are 2 (since 4 = 2 x 2).
- Prime factors of 3 is 3 (since 3 is a prime number).

There are no common prime factors between 4 and 3, so the result of 4 # 3 is 0.

2. Addition (A): Add the result of step 1 to 2

The given problem is: 5 + 2 @ 4

According to the rules, we perform the addition (5 + 2) before the concatenation (@):

5 + 2 = 7

Now, we are left with:

7 @ 4

Since the concatenation operation joins numbers at a digit level, we join the digits of 7 and 4:

7 @ 4 = 74

We can remove the parentheses since 14 + 4 has been calculated.

E: There are no exponents to evaluate.

F: Prime Factor Counting
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3
We need to evaluate the prime factor counting between 2 and 3.
The prime factors of |2| are just 2 itself, and the prime factors of |3| are just 3.

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Before moving on to addition or subtraction, we need to perform the prime factor counting.

   (14 + 4) = 18

   The expression now looks like this: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Prime Factor Counting (F): Next, we determine the shared unique prime factors between the absolute values of the numbers around the hash sign (#).

   The prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since they have no prime factors in common, the result of the prime factor counting is zero.

1. Perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation for each pair of numbers:
   - For the first pair, 8 # 2, the unique prime factors of 8 are 2 (since 8 is 2^3), and the unique prime factor of 2 is, of course, 2. So, they share exactly one prime factor, which is 2.
   - For the second pair, 6 # 6, the unique prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. As we are dealing with the same number, it shares all its prime factors with itself, which means there are two shared prime factors.

2. Apply the Prime Factor Counting results:
   - 8 # 2 results in 1, because there's 1 shared prime factor.
   - 6 # 6 also results in 2, because there are 2 shared prime factors (2 and 3).

3. Perform the Addition (A) operation:
   - Add the results of the Prime Factor Counting together: 1 + 2.

The expression given is:
8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
- We count the unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 8 and 2.
8 = 2^3 and its prime factors are {2}
2 = 2^1 and its prime factors are {2}
There is 1 shared prime factor.

So, 8 # 2 = 1

- Next, we count the unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 6 and 6.
6 = 2 * 3 and its prime factors are {2, 3}
6 = 2 * 3 and its prime factors are {2, 3}
There are 2 shared prime factors (2 and 3).

In the given problem, we have two Prime Factor Counting operations:

Let's evaluate each one:

1. \( 8 \# 2 \)
The prime factorization of 8 is \(2 \times 2 \times 2\), which is \(2^3\).
The prime factorization of 2 is 2.
The shared prime factor between 8 and 2 is just 2. Thus, \( 8 \# 2 = 1 \) because there is one shared prime factor.

2. \( 6 \# 6 \)
The prime factorization of 6 is \(2 \times 3\).
Since both numbers are the same, the shared prime factors are the factors of 6 itself, which are 2 and 3. Thus, \( 6 \# 6 = 2 \), because there are two shared prime factors (2 and 3).
