Step 1: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses.
14 + 4 = 18

The expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Evaluate the concatenation operation (@).
Because the first number is positive (6), and the second number is also positive (18), we can simply concatenate them without taking the absolute values.
6 @ 18 = 618
