gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem with the new operations and order of operations (PEFMDASC), we should follow the correct sequence of calculations. Here's how to evaluate the expression 5 + 2@4:

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses to evaluate.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents to evaluate.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): There are no prime factor counting operations to evaluate.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There are no multiplications or divisions to evaluate.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We see that there is an addition operation, but we must check if there are any operations that need to be performed before addition in the order of operations.
6. Concatenation (C): According to the order of operations, we need to perform the concatenation before the addition.

So first, we perform 2@4:

2@4 = 24 (because the operation @ concatenates the digits of 2 and 4)

Next, we perform the addition with the result of the concatenation:

5 + 24 = 29

The final answer is 29, so we state the solution as follows:

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the given Mathematics problem according to the new conventions, we need to follow the extended order of operations PEFMDASC (Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction, Concatenation).

Given the expression: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Step 1: Evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) before addition since it takes precedence.
- 8 has prime factors 2 (2^3).
- 2 has prime factors 2.
8 # 2 would be the number of unique prime factors they share. Since both 8 and 2 only have the prime factor 2, there is 1 shared prime factor.

- 6 has prime factors 2 and 3.
6 # 6 would be the number of unique prime factors that 6 shares with itself. Since 6 has prime factors 2 and 3, there are 2 shared prime factors when comparing 6 to itself (2 and 3).

Step 2: Evaluate both Prime Factor Counting operations.
8 # 2 = 1 (since 8 and 2 share the prime factor 2)
6 # 6 = 2 (since 6 shares the prime factors 2 and 3 with itself)

The expression now becomes: 1 + 2

Step 3: Evaluate the Addition (A).
1 + 2 = 3

The final answer is 3. 

Thus, based on the new order of operations and the defined mathematical problem, ""The answer is 3."""
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem with the new operations and order of operations (PEFMDASC), we will follow the steps outlined below:

1. (P) Parentheses: There aren't any parentheses to evaluate.
2. (E) Exponents: There are no exponents to evaluate either.
3. (F) Prime Factor Counting: Calculate 4#3, which is the number of unique prime factors shared by 4 and 3.
4. (M) Multiplication: There's no multiplication to do.
5. (D) Division: There's no division to do either.
6. (A) Addition: We'll be adding the result of the prime factor counting to 2.
7. (S) Subtraction: There's no subtraction to do in this problem.
8. (C) Concatenation: There is no concatenation to do.

Now, we perform the operation 4#3:

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (4 = 2 * 2).
The prime factors of 3 are just 3 (3 = 3).

Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, the result of the prime factor counting operation is:

4#3 = 0

Now we can move on to addition:

0 + 2 = 2

Therefore, the final answer is:

Expression: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

1. Parentheses (P): Evaluate expressions within parentheses first.
   - (14+4) becomes 18

The expression now is: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

2. Exponents (E): There are no exponentiations to evaluate.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F): Evaluate the prime factor counting operation.
   - The prime factors of 2 are {2}, and the prime factors of 3 are {3}, so 2#3 evaluates to 0 because there are no shared prime factors.

The expression now is: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

4. Multiplication (M) and Division (D) (from left to right): No multiplication or division to evaluate.

5. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S) (from left to right): Add and subtract from left to right.
   - 12 - 0 becomes 12

The expression now is: 6 @ 18 + 12

6. Concatenation (C): Perform the concatenation operation last, from left to right.
   - 6 @ 18 becomes 618 since we simply join the digits

Let's evaluate the problem step by step:

Step 1: Evaluate Prime Factor counting (F) first.
3 # 2 involves counting the number of unique prime factors shared between the two numbers. 
The prime factors of 3 are just 3 itself since 3 is a prime number. The prime factors of 2 are just 2, since 2 is a prime number. There are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2.

So, 3 # 2 = 0.

5 + 0

Step 3: Addition (A) follows next.

5 + 0 = 5

The expression given is:

5 + 2 @ 4

Since there is no parentheses, exponents, or prime factor counting in this expression, we can skip those steps. The next operation to look for is multiplication or division, but there are none in this expression. Therefore, we move on to addition and subtraction.

The plus sign indicates we need to handle addition, but the presence of the concatenation operator '@' requires us to revisit the order: addition takes precedence over concatenation according to the updated rules.

So we do the concatenation operation first:

2 @ 4 = 24

Notice that 2 and 4 are the digits to be concatenated, and absolute values are not relevant since both numbers are positive.

Now, we return to the addition:

5 + 24 = 29

The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (2^3).
The prime factors of 2 are 2.

Since 2 is a common prime factor, 8 # 2 results in 1.

6 # 6: 
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
Since 6 has the same prime factors as itself, 6 # 6 is 2 (since there are two unique prime factors: 2 and 3).

Now, substitute the outcomes of the prime factor counting into the expression.

Step 2 - Substitution:
8 # 2 + 6 # 6 becomes 1 + 2.

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents in this expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we evaluate the prime factor counting between 2 and 3:
The prime factors of 2 are just 2 since it's a prime number, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3 since it's also a prime number. They share no common prime factors, so:
2#3 = 0

Now, the expression becomes:

There is no multiplication or division to perform.

Step 5: Addition/Subtraction (A/S)
We perform addition and subtraction from left to right as follows:
First, we do the addition (since there is no subtraction before it):
12 - 0 = 12

Now, the expression becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
Finally, we carry out the concatenation from left to right:
6 @ 18 = 618 (since concatenation operation joins the digits of the numbers)

First, we identify the unique prime factors common to both numbers in each prime factor counting operation:

- 8 has the prime factors 2, 2, and 2.
- 2 has the prime factor 2.

They share the prime factor 2, so 8 # 2 = 1, because there is one unique common prime factor.

- 6 has the prime factors 2 and 3.

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we'll apply the updated order of operations PEFMDASC.

Step 1: Calculate Prime Factor Counting (F)
The expression given is 8 # 2 + 6 # 6. We will first evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F):

For the term 8 # 2:
8 has prime factors of 2 (2 x 2 x 2).
2 is a prime number, thus its prime factors include just 2 itself.
The count of unique prime factors shared between 8 and 2 is 1 (prime factor 2).

Now, for the term 6 # 6:
6 has prime factors of 2 and 3 (2 x 3).
Since both numbers are the same (6 and 6), the count of unique prime factors shared is the same as the prime factors of 6 which are 2 and 3. So, the count is 2.

Step 2: Apply Addition (A)
With the Prime Factor Counting calculated, our expression now looks like this: 1 + 2.

6. Concatenation (C): Join digits of numbers from left to right.

Problem: \( 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3 \)

First, solve the parentheses:

\( 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2#3 \)
\( = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3 \)

Next, no exponents are present so we can move on.

Now, we check for Prime Factor Counting:

Since 2 and 3 are both prime numbers and 3 is a factor of itself and not of 2, they have no shared prime factors. Thus:

\( 2#3 = 0 \)

Our expression now becomes:

\( 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 \)

Now we deal with addition and subtraction:

\( 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 \)
\( = 6 @ 18 + 12 \)

Subtraction results in no change as we are subtracting 0.

The last operation we have left is concatenation:

\( 6 @ 18 \)
