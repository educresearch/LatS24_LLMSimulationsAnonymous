Next, let's look at prime factor counting (F) as it comes next in PEFMDASC:

2  #  3 = 1 (since both 2 and 3 only has 1 prime factor itself.)

Then substitute it back in to get:

6@18 + 12-1

Now, we execute the subtraction operation (S):

12-1 = 11

6@18 + 11

                    Two new operations were defined:

                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):

                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.

                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)

                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

So, the prime factor of 3 is just 3 and the prime factor of 2 is 2. Therefore, the number of common primes between 3 and 2 is zero.

Firstly, solve the expression in the parentheses:

6@(14+4) + 12 - 2 # 3 = 6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Now, the order goes as Prime Factor counting (F), Addition and Subtraction (A/S), and Concatenation (C).

Start with Prime Factor counting (F): 

2 # 3 = 0 (since there are no common prime factors between 2 and 3).

So, our equation becomes: 6@18 + 12 - 0

Then, move to Addition/Subtraction (A/S):

Add 12 to 0: 

The new expression is 6@18 + 12 = 6@18.

Finally, Concatenation (C):

Concatenate 6 and 18: 6@18 = 618.

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since both numbers are the same, they share the same prime factors. So, 6#6 = 2.

There are addition (+) and prime factor counting (#) operations present. Following the newly updated orders of operations (PEFMDASC), we should handle the prime factor counting before addition.

The order of operations are as follow:

1. Prime Factor Counting (#):  The prime factors of |3| (3) are 3 and of |2| (2) are 2. Since they do not share a common prime factor, 3#2 equals 0.

2. Addition (+): The result is 5 + 0.

Now, to calculate these steps:

1. 3#2 = 0 (no common prime factors)
2. 5 + 0 = 5

The answer is 5."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):

                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)

The expression has two prime factor counting operations to solve initially.

For 8#2, the prime factor of 8 is 2, and the prime factor of 2 is also 2. They share the prime factor 2. So, 8#2 =1

For 6#6, the prime factors of 6 are 2, and 3. The two 6s share the same prime factors, so they share all of them. However, we are only interested in unique prime factors. So, 6#6 =2.

So after evaluating prime factor counting first as per the PEFMDASC rule, our expression 8#2 + 6#6 becomes 1 + 2.

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.
                    It's crucial to get this right for accurate calculations.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Step 1: According to the order of operations PEFMDASC, we perform the calculations inside parentheses first.

In the expression 6 @ (14 + 4), the calculation inside the parentheses is an addition operation.

This step results in 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3.

Step 2: Next, according to PEFMDASC, any prime factor counting (F) is performed before any addition or subtraction operations. 

But we don't have any exponent or multiplication operations in the expression (they come before the F). 

The prime factor counting operation is 2 # 3. 

The prime factors of 2 are 2; the prime factors of 3 are 3. Therefore, they don't share any prime factors.

This results in 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0.

Step 3: Now, we perform the addition operation, according to PEFMDASC, addition/subtraction (A/S) must be performed before concatenation (C).

So, we perform 18 + 12 which equals 30.

This leaves us with 6 @ 30 - 0.

Step 4: Concatenation is now performed in the step since it comes next in the PEFMDASC order.

So, 6 @ 30 yields 630.

This leaves us with 630 - 0.

Step 5: Lastly, we do the subtraction.

630 - 0 equals 630.

The answer is 630."
