gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Given expression is: 5 + 2 @ 4.

According to the new rule, PEFMDASC, the operation of addition comes before the operation of concatenation, so you need to perform the addition operation first.

So, firstly, add 5 and 2 to get 7.

Then, concatenate the result with 4. When you concatenate 7 and 4, you get 74.

So, the expression simplifies as follows: 

5 + 2 @ 4
= 7 @ 4
= 74.

Therefore, the final solution is:

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: First, we need to calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation. 

The unique prime factor lists for the numbers are:
- 8: 2
- 2: 2
- 6: 2, 3

So, 
8#2 = 1 (since the shared prime factor for 8 and 2 is 2)
6#6 = 2 (since for 6 and 6, they share two prime factors 2 and 3)

Now applying the addition (A):
1 + 2 = 3

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: Based on the new order of operation rule, PEFMDASC, the calculation process should be as follows:

First, we need to evaluate the expressions in the parentheses:
6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3 
= 6@18 + 12-2  #  3 

Then, we perform the Concatenation operation (since it comes before addition and subtraction in the new sequence):
= 618 + 12-2  #  3 

Next, we perform the Addition and Subtraction operation:
= 630 - 2  #  3 

Lastly, we execute the Prime Factor counting operation:
= 630  #  3 

The Prime Factors of 630 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. The prime factor of 3 is 3. So there is only 1 unique prime factor shared by both, which is 3.

So,

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we use the new order of operations, starting with Prime Factor Counting (F).

8 # 2: The prime factors of 8 are 2 (three times), while the prime factors of 2 are singularly 2. Therefore, they share 1 unique prime factor, so 8#2 = 1.

6 # 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, while the prime factors of 6 (the same number) are 2 and 3. Therefore, all the prime factors are shared and unique, so 6#6 = 2.

Substitute the results back into the equation:

The equation is now: 1 + 2

Following the usual order of operations, we perform the addition, which gives us 3.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: Initially evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F), using operation 3#2. 

Looking at the prime factor of 3 and 2, since 3 is a prime number whose only prime factor is 3 and 2 is a prime number whose only prime factor is 2. Therefore, they don't share any prime factors. Thus, the result of 3#2 = 0.

Then, replace the calculated value into the equation, gives us 5 + 0.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: For the given problem, we are required to use the newly introduced mathematical operation Prime Factor Counting (F) and the updated order of operations. 

8#2: This operation counts the unique prime factors common to |8| and |2|. The prime factor of 8 is 2 and the prime factor of 2 is 2. So, there is 1 common prime factor, which is 2. Therefore, 8#2 = 1.

6#6: This operation counts the unique prime factors common to |6| and |6|. The prime factor of 6 is 2 and 3, and obviously, the same prime factors apply for the other 6. Since all prime factors are exactly the same, this means there are exactly 2 prime factors common to the two numbers. Therefore, 6#6 = 2.

Problem: 6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3

Here's the breakdown of the problem:

1. Parentheses: We need to solve the operation within the parentheses first. The operation within them is 14+4, which equals 18. 

   6@18 + 12 - 2  # 3  

2. Prime Factor Counting: Now we can perform the operation of prime factor counting, denoted by the symbol '#'. Here, the operation is 2 # 3. As the prime factor of 2 is 2 and the prime factor of 3 is 3, there are no common prime factors. Hence 2 # 3 equals 0.

   6@18 + 12 - 0

3. Addition and Subtraction: Moving left to right, we perform the operation 12 - 0, which equals 12, and then, add the result to 18.

   6@18 + 12 = 6@30

4. Concatenation: The last operation is that of concatenation, represented by the symbol '@'. Here, 6@30 becomes 630.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: In this problem, we have to consider the updated order of operations. Here, we have an addition operation and a prime factor counting operation.

Problem: 5 + 3 # 2

According to the new order of operations PEFMDASC, Prime Factor Counting (#) should be done before Addition (+). So, we first find the unique prime factors common to |3| and |2|.

The prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2, and there are no common prime factors between 3 and 2. Hence, 3 # 2 = 0.

Substitute 3 # 2 = 0 back to the problem, we get: 

5 + 0 = 5

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: The given problem is 5 + 2 @ 4.

We first need to refer to the updated expanded order of operations, which is PEFMDASC.

To solve this, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: The first operation in PEFMDASC is Parentheses, but there are no parentheses in this problem.

Step 2: Next would be Exponents, but there are no exponents in this problem.

Step 3: After Exponents, we would handle Prime Factor counting, but there are no occurrences of # in this problem.

Step 4: Then would be Multiplication / Division. Again, there are no multiplication or division symbols in this problem.

Step 5: The next operation would be Addition / Subtraction. There is an addition operation in the problem, which we now perform: 5+2=7

Step 6: The last operation according to our order is Concatenation. There's a concatenation operation in the problem: 7 @ 4 = 74.

This gives the final solution in the form as per the instruction ""The answer is __.""

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: Let's solve using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC).

Step 1: Evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F). We'll do this for 8#2 and 6#6.

Prime factors of |8| = 2
Prime factors of |2| = 2
So, 8#2 = 1 (They have one common prime factor, which is 2)

Prime factors of |6| = 2, 3
So, 6#6 = 2 (They have two prime factors, which are 2 and 3, which are exactly common with itself)

Now, the expression becomes 1 + 2

Step 2: Evaluate Addition (A). 

This results in 1 + 2 = 3

So, 8#2 + 6#6 = 3

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: The given problem is 4 # 3 + 2.

We first apply the rule of Prime Factor Counting (#) before addition, as per the PEFMDASC order.

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (#).
Here, we're dealing with 4 # 3. 
Prime factors of 4 are 2 and prime factors of 3 are 3. There are no shared factors, so 4 # 3 = 0.

So, the expression now becomes 0 + 2.

Step 2: Addition.
0 + 2 = 2.

Hence, the answer to 4 # 3 + 2 is 2. The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: To solve this equation we will follow the PEFMDASC order: Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division (left-to-right), Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right), and Concatenation.

First, let's solve what's inside the Parentheses:

6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3
= 6@18 + 12-2  #  3

Next, we will move to the Addition and Subtraction (since Exponents, Prime Factor Counting, Multiplication and Division do not exist in the equation):

= 6@18 +10  #  3

Next, we'll look at Prime Factor Counting:

2 and 3 both are prime numbers. But the only shared prime factor between 10 and 3 is 2. Thus, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 1:

= 6@18 + 1

Concatenation is last in the order of operations, so we solve the concatenation next:

= 618 + 1

The final step is to add the numbers together:

= 619.

The answer is 619."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: The given problem is 5 + 3#2.

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (#).
Here, we have 3#2. The prime factors of |3| are [3] and of |2| are [2]. There are no shared prime factors.
Therefore, 3#2 = 0.

So, the new expression is 5 + 0.

Step 2: Addition (+).
Performing addition, we have:
5 + 0 = 5.

The answer is 5."
