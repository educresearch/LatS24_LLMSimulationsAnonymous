gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC. Here's the breakdown:

1. Parentheses (P)
2. Exponents (E)
3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
4. Multiplication (M) and Division (D) from Left to Right
5. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S) from Left to Right
6. Concatenation (C) from Left to Right

Given the problem 5 + 2@4, we have an addition operation and a concatenation operation.

Following the rules, we must first perform the addition before the concatenation since under the new rules, concatenation (C) comes after addition (A).

Here are the steps:

5 + 2@4

Since there are no parentheses, exponents, prime factor counting, multiplication, or division, we go straight to addition and then concatenation.

First, perform the addition:
5 + 2 = 7

Next, perform the concatenation with the result and the remaining number:
7@4

The concatenation operation joins the digits of the numbers together:
7@4 = 74

So the final answer is:

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: Let's evaluate the given expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 step by step using the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. (P) Parentheses: There are no parentheses to evaluate.
2. (E) Exponents: There are no exponents to evaluate.
3. (F) Prime Factor counting: Evaluate the prime factor counting operations.
   - First, we evaluate 8 # 2:
     The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (2^3), and the prime factors of 2 are just a single 2.
     They share the prime factor 2. Count of unique shared prime factors: 1.
   - Then, we evaluate 6 # 6:
     The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
     6 shares all its prime factors with itself, so the unique count is the number of distinct prime factors.
     Count of unique shared prime factors: 2.
   
   Our expression now becomes: 1 + 2

4. (M) Multiplication: There are no multiplication operations to perform.
5. (D) Division: There is no division to perform.
6. (A) Addition: Now we perform the addition.
   - We add 1 and 2: 1 + 2 = 3

7. (S) Subtraction: There is no subtraction to perform.
8. (C) Concatenation: There is no concatenation operation to perform.

So, the final answer is \( 1 + 2 = 3 \).

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC. Here's the breakdown:

The expression we need to evaluate is: 4#3 + 2

According to the operations defined:
1. The '#' operator stands for the Prime Factor Counting operation, which must be evaluated before addition (since F comes before A in PEFMDASC).

Let's evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operation first:

- 4#3
- The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (or just 2 since we are looking for unique factors), and the prime factor of 3 is 3.
- Since 4 and 3 do not share any prime factors, the result of the operation is 0.

Therefore, 4#3 = 0

Now the expression simplifies to:
0 + 2

The next step in the order of operations is addition:
0 + 2 = 2

Thus, the final answer is:

The answer is 2."

6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

First, we evaluate what's inside the parentheses (P):
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Then we go for the prime factor counting (F), where 2#3 means the count of unique prime factors shared by 2 and 3:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0
(since 2 and 3 do not share any prime factors, as the prime factor of 2 is 2 and that of 3 is 3)

Now, we proceed with addition (A) and subtraction (S) as they come from left to right:
6 @ 30 - 0
(since 18 + 12 equals 30)

And finally, we apply concatenation (C) which also occurs left to right:
630 - 0
(since 6 @ 30 is the concatenation of 6 and 30)

Subtracting 0 does not change the value:
630

The answer is 630."

Given the problem 5 + 3 # 2, let's apply the order of operations:

- First, we perform the Prime Factor Counting ('#') operation because it comes before Addition in the order. 
- The prime factors of 3 are just 3, and the prime factors of 2 are just 2.
- Since there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, 3 # 2 equals 0.

The expression now is:

Since there are no parentheses, exponents, prime factor counting operations, multiplication, or division present in the expression, we'll apply addition and concatenation operations accordingly.

Following the new order of operations, we need to perform the addition before the concatenation. So we first add 5 + 2 and then apply the concatenation with 4:

5 + 2 = 7

Now we apply the concatenation operation with the result and 4:

7 @ 4 = 74 (because concatenation means joining the digits together)

Therefore, the answer to the expression is:

Given expression: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

PEFMDASC stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting, Multiplication and Division (left to right), Addition and Subtraction (left to right), and Concatenation (left to right).

First, there are no parentheses or exponents to evaluate, so we move onto the Prime Factor Counting operation.

1. Evaluate 8 # 2:
8 has the prime factors 2 * 2 * 2.
2 has the prime factor 2.
Shared prime factors: 2 (just the number itself since it's the only prime factor of 2)
8 # 2 = 1 (there's only one unique prime factor they share: 2).

2. Evaluate 6 # 6:
6 has the prime factors 2 * 3.
6 also has the prime factors 2 * 3.
Shared prime factors: 2 and 3.
Since there are two distinct shared prime factors, 2 and 3:
6 # 6 = 2.

Now, with the prime factor counting done, we move onto addition:

3. Add the results:
1 (from 8 # 2) + 2 (from 6 # 6) = 3

According to the revised order of operations, we have completed the expression, and there are no further operations to apply.

Therefore, the final answer is 3.

The prime factors of 4 are 2 (since 4 = 2 * 2), and the prime factors of 3 are 3 (since 3 is a prime number). There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so:

4 # 3 = 0

6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

First, we start with the parentheses:
(14+4) = 18

Then, the expression becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Next, we evaluate the prime factor counting (F):
2#3 = 0 because there are no common prime factors between 2 and 3.

Now the expression is:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Moving to addition and subtraction (A/S), but since concatenation (C) is the new operation that comes after A/S but before C in precedence, we handle the addition first:
12 - 0 = 12

So we get:
6 @ 18 + 12

Now we evaluate the concatenation (C)
6 @ 18 = 618

Lastly, we perform the remaining addition:
618 + 12 = 630

Firstly, we look for any parentheses and exponents, but in this case, there are none.

Next, we consider the Prime Factor Counting operation (\#). The operation \(3 \# 2\) counts the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 3 and 2. The prime factors of 3 are just 3 itself, and for 2, it's just 2. Since they have no prime factors in common, \(3 \# 2\) yields 0.

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the given Math problem \(8 \# 2 + 6 \# 6\), we need to apply the updated order of operations PEFMDASC.

Here is the breakdown of the operations:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): We perform prime factor counting first before addition.

- The prime factors of \(8\) are \(2, 2,\) and \(2\).
- The prime factors of \(2\) are \(2\).

Therefore, \(8 \# 2\) counts the number of unique prime factors that \(8\) and \(2\) share which is \(1\) (since they both share the prime factor \(2\)).

- The prime factors of \(6\) are \(2\) and \(3\).
- As \(6\) has the prime factors \(2\) and \(3\), but since \(6 \# 6\) is comparing the number with itself, it includes all the unique prime factors that it has.

Therefore, \(6 \# 6\) is saying how many unique prime factors does \(6\) have, which is \(2\) (prime factors \(2\) and \(3\)).

2. Addition (A): Next, we perform the addition operation.

The sum is \((8 \# 2) + (6 \# 6) = 1 + 2 = 3\).

M/D: Multiplication and Division (left to right)
A/S: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
C: Concatenation (left to right)

1. First, we evaluate expression inside the parentheses (P):

2. Next, we look for any prime factor counting (F), which is:
   2 # 3 = 1 (since the only common unique prime factor of 2 and 3 is not shared, 2 is prime but 3 is also prime and different)

3. Now we proceed with concatenation (C), since there are no exponents (E), or multiplication/division (M/D) to be considered before:

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
We first calculate the prime factor counting between the numbers in the expression.

\( 8 \# 2 \): The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or \(2^3\)), and the prime factor of 2 is 2. Since they share the prime factor of 2, the result is 1 because there's only one unique prime factor being counted.
\( 6 \# 6 \): The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since we're looking for the count of unique prime factors shared between the same number (6), the result is 2 (since we have both prime factors 2 and 3).

Step 2: Addition (A)
We then add the results of the prime factor counting operations:

\( 1 + 2 \) gives us \( 3 \).

So, the expression simplifies to:

The expression is: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
First, calculate the expression inside the parentheses.
(14+4) = 18

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents in this expression to calculate.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Calculate the prime factor counting operation.
The prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. They do not share any prime factors, so:
