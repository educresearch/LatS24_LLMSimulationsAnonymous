gpt-4-0613,1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this given problem, firstly we need to apply the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation:

First, let's identify the unique prime factors for both |4| and |3|:

- The prime factors of |4| are {2}
- The prime factors of |3| are {3}

Next, find how many of these prime factors are shared:
- There are no shared prime factors between |4| and |3|, therefore 4 # 3 = 0

Substitute that value back into the original problem, we get:

0+2

Performing the addition operation we get:

2

So, the final answer to this problem is ""The answer is 2.""","GPT Response: Based on the new order of operations, prime factor counting comes before addition. 

The prime factor of 4 is 2 and the prime factor of 3 is 3. There are no shared prime factors, so 4 # 3 equals 0.

So, the calculation simplifies as follows,

4 # 3 + 2 
= 0 + 2 
= 2

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Following the Order of Operations (PEFMDASC), we perform the operations in the following sequence:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): 

4 # 3 = 1
The prime factors of 4 are {2}, and the prime factors of 3 are {3}. So there are no common prime factors between 4 and 3. Therefore, 4 # 3 = 0.

We then replace the prime factor counting operation by its result in the original expression obtaining: 0 + 2

2. Addition (A):

0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Let's solve this equation step by step:

We'll denote 4 # 3 + 2 as Equation 1.

Step 1: First we'll evaluate the F operation (Prime Factor Counting) as per the revised order of operations (PEFMDASC). The prime factor of 4 is 2 and the prime factor of 3 is 3. As there are no shared prime factors, 4 # 3 is 0.

So Equation 1 becomes: 0 + 2

Step 2: Now, we'll evaluate addition. 

0 + 2 = 2

The final answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: To solve this given problem, firstly we need to apply the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation.

First, let's identify the unique prime factors of the absolute value of the numbers:
The prime factors of |3| are {3} and those of |2| are {2}. 

Comparing, we can see there are no shared unique prime factors between 3 and 2, hence, 3#2 equals 0.

So, our expression now becomes: 5 + 0.

Finally, we proceed to the addition operation, where we add 5 and 0. 
This results to 5.

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: Based on the new order of operations, prime factor counting comes before addition. 

The prime factor of 3 is 3 and the prime factor of 2 is 2. There are no shared prime factors, so 3#2 is 0. 

So, the calculation simplifies as follows,

5 + 3#2
= 5 + 0
= 5

Therefore, the final answer is 5. 

""The answer is 5.""","GPT Response: Following the Order of Operations (PEFMDASC), we perform the Prime Factor Counting operation (F) first:

3#2 = 1
(since prime factor of 2 is 2 and prime factor of 3 is only 3, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0)

Replacing this in the equation, we get: 
5 + 0 = 5.

So, the final answer is 5.

The answer is 5","GPT Response: Let's solve this equation step by step:

We'll denote 5 + 3#2 as a # b + c.

Here, a = 3, b = 2, and c = 5. According to PEFMDASC order, we need to do prime factor counting before addition. Therefore, first we have to find a # b , that is, find the number of common prime factors in 3 and 2.

(1) Step one: Finding prime factors of |a| and |b|. 

Prime factors of |2|: 2.

Prime factors of |3|: 3.

(2) Step two: Comparing the prime factors of |a| and |b|, it's clear that 2 and 3 don't share any prime factors, so a#b = 0.

So, 3#2 = 0.

Now, we can replace 3#2 with 0 in the original expression, and it becomes 5 + 0. According to PEFMDASC order, we do the addition operation next (because it comes after prime factor counting).

We calculate 5 + 0 = 5.

So, the answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: According to the given operation order PEFMDASC, the operations will be performed in the following order:

First, perform the concatenation operation:
2 @ 4 = 24

Then, perform the addition operation:
5 + 24 = 29

Therefore, the solution to your given math problem, ""5 + 2 @ 4"", will be:

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: Based on the new order of operations, addition should be executed before the concatenation operation. Therefore, we first add 5 and 2:

5 + 2 = 7

gpt-4-0613,1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: Breaking the given problem based on the new convention we get:

1. Evaluate Parenthesis first:
   6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3 
   => 6@18 + 12-2 # 3 

2. Perform Concatenation:
    618 + 12-2 # 3 

3. Perform Addition and Subtraction:
    630 - 2 # 3

4. Evaluate Prime Factor counting last:
    630 - 1 

This gives us 629. Hence, 
""The answer is 629.""","GPT Response: According to the revised order of operations, the problem will be simplified as follows:

6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3 

Parentheses first, so simplify the expression in parentheses:
= 6@18 + 12-2 # 3

According to the priority, and prime factor counting need to be done before addition and subtraction:
= 6@18 + 12-1
(Note here that 2 and 3 have one common prime factor, so 2 # 3 = 1)

Performing addition and subtraction from left to right:
= 6@18 + 11
= 6@29

Finally, perform the concatenation operation:
= 629

Hence, the answer is 629.","GPT Response: First, let's solve the expression inside the parentheses (PEFMDAS).

6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3
= 6@18 + 12-2  #  3

Next, deal with the operations as per the order of operations PEFMDASC. According to this, concatenation (C) will be solved before the addition and subtraction (AS).

= 618 + 12-2  #  3

Now, solve for # or Prime Factor Counting (F). In this case, Prime Factor Counting comes before the addition or subtraction:

= 618 + 12-2 
= 618 + 10
= 628

So, the solution to this given Mathematics problem is 628. 

The answer is 628.","GPT Response: To solve 6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3, we proceed according to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

Step 1: Parentheses
= 6@18 + 12-2  #  3

Step 2: Addition/Subtraction (as there is no exponent or prime factor counting within this step)
= 6 @ 18 + 10 # 3

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting
= 6 @ 18 + 1
(We do prime factor counting now because it's before addition and concatenation according to the updated PEFMDASC order; the prime factors of 10 are 2 and 5 and the prime factors of 3 are 3, thus they share no prime factors)

Step 4: Addition
= 6 @ 19

Step 5: Concatenation
= 619

gpt-4-0613,1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve the above mathematical operation, we'll proceed step by step according to the new order of operations, which is PEFMDASC. We have to apply the Prime Factor counting operation (F) first before addition (A).

Prime factor of 8: 2.
Prime factor of 2: 2. 
So, 8#2 = 1 as they have one shared prime factor which is 2.

Prime factor of 6: 2, 3.
So, 6#6 = 2 as it has two unique prime factors 2 and 3.

Now, we can add these two results:
1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: To solve the problem 8#2 + 6#6, you need to follow the PEFMDAS order of operations:

First, we do prime factor counting (F): 
- 8#2: Unique prime factors of 8 are 2 and those of 2 are also 2. Therefore, 8#2 = 1.
- 6#6: Since it is the same number, all prime factors are similar. Prime factors of 6 are 2,3. Therefore, 6#6 = 2

Then, we proceed to perform addition (A):

(8#2) + (6#6) = 1 + 2 = 3.

Therefore, the solution to ""8#2 + 6#6"" is 3.

Final answer: The answer is 3.","GPT Response: According to the order of operations PEFMDASC, we first have to perform the Prime Factor Counting (F).

Consider F operation: 

8#2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, and that of 2 itself is a prime. So, there is 1 common prime factor.

6#6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since we are comparing with the same number, it has the same prime factors. So, there are 2 unique prime factors in this case.

Now, we substitute these into the equation:

= 1 + 2 (since we need to evaluate prime factor counting before addition)

Finally, we perform the addition operation:

= 1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: To solve this expression using the PEFMDASC order of operations, we first need to compute the prime factor counts (#) before performing addition.

Before that, let us examine the prime factors of 8, 2, and 6:

- The prime factors of 8 are 2 (since 8 = 2^3)
- The prime factors of 2 are 2 (itself, as it is a prime number)
- The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 (since 6 = 2*3)

Now, we perform prime factor counts (F) operation:

- 8 # 2 = 1 (since 2 is the only common prime factor between 8 and 2)
- 6 # 6 = 2 (since 2 and 3 are both prime factors of 6)

Inserting these results into the expression gives us:

1 + 2

The last operation is addition, we calculate it:

= 3

The answer is 3."
