gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, let's apply the new order of operations PEFMDASC. We need to handle the prime factor counting operation (F) before we proceed to addition (A).

The prime factor counting operation:

4 # 3 will count the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 4 and 3.

The prime factorization of 4 is 2 * 2 (or just 2 since we are looking for unique prime factors).
The prime factorization of 3 is just 3.

Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, 4 # 3 = 0.

Now, we can move on to the addition operation:

0 + 2 = 2.

Thus, after carrying out the prime factor counting and then the addition, the final answer is:

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve the problem, we need to apply the newly updated order of operations PEFMDASC.

For the expression 4 # 3 + 2, we follow these steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): First, we apply the operation of Prime Factor Counting because it precedes addition (A) in the order of operations.

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2. The prime factors of 3 are just 3. Since they do not share any prime factors, 4 # 3 equals 0:

4 # 3 = 0 (because there are no shared prime factors).

2. Addition (A): Now we can add the result of the prime factor counting to 2:

0 + 2 = 2.

Therefore, following the order of operations and accounting for the new mathematical operations, the final answer is:

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2, we must follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

First, we evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F):
4 # 3
The prime factors of 4 are {2, 2}, and the prime factors of 3 is {3}. There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so:
4 # 3 = 0

Now, we add the result to 2:
0 + 2 = 2

Given the operations performed, the final answer is:
The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Let's solve the given problem step-by-step using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC.

Step 1: Calculate Prime Factor Counting (F)
The expression starts with 4 # 3. We need to determine the count of unique prime factors shared between the numbers 4 and 3.

- The prime factors of 4 are 2 (since 4 = 2^2).
- The prime factors of 3 are 3 (since 3 is a prime number itself).

Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, 4 # 3 = 0.

Our expression now simplifies to:
0 + 2

Following through with the operations, the final answer for the expression 5 + 2 @ 4 is:

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: To solve the problem, we need to apply the updated order of operations PEFMDASC (Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction, Concatenation), starting with addition and subtraction, followed by concatenation since there are no parentheses, exponents, prime factor counting, multiplication, or division present.

First, we handle the addition:

5 + 2 = 7

Now that the addition has been performed, we proceed with the concatenation operation:

7 @ 4

7 @ 4 = 74

Therefore, the final answer to the given mathematical problem is 74.

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 2 @ 4, we must follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

The Concatenation of 2 @ 4 results in merging the digits:
2 @ 4 = 24

Then we perform the Addition (A):
5 + 24 = 29

Therefore, the final result of the expression is 29.

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: Let's solve the given problem step-by-step using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC.

6. Concatenation (C): We do have a concatenation operation to evaluate, which is 2 @ 4.

2 @ 4 means joining the digits 2 and 4 together:

According to this order, we start with Prime Factor Counting (F) because there are no parentheses, exponents, multiplication, or division in the expression.

The expression is 5 + 3 # 2. First, we look at 3 # 2, which represents the count of unique prime factors shared by 3 and 2. Since 3 and 2 are both prime and not the same prime number, they share no common prime factors. Therefore, 3 # 2 = 0.

Performing Prime Factor Counting (F):
3 # 2 involves finding the count of unique prime factors that numbers 3 and 2 share. The prime factors for 3 is only 3, and for 2 is only 2. Therefore, they share no common prime factors.

5. Addition and Subtraction (from Left to Right)
6. Concatenation (C) (from Left to Right)

The given expression is:
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Firstly, we need to solve the expression inside the parentheses, which involves addition:
(14 + 4) = 18

The expression now looks like:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Then we need to solve the prime factor counting operation (F):
2 # 3 requires finding shared unique prime factors between 2 and 3. Since 2 and 3 have no shared prime factors (as they are both prime and distinct), the result is 0.

The expression now looks like:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Now we look for any other operations before the concatenation (C) operation. Since there are no other operations that take precedence over concatenation at this point, we can proceed with it:

Concatenation takes absolute values for the operation, so:
6 @ 18 = 618

The expression is now:
618 + 12 - 0

First, we evaluate the expression inside the parentheses (14 + 4):
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents
There are no exponents in this expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we evaluate the prime factor counting between 2 and 3:
The prime factors of 2 are just 2 since it's a prime number, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3 since it's also a prime number. They share no common prime factors, so 2 # 3 is 0.
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

First, we add 18 and 12:
6 @ 30 - 0
Now, we subtract 0 from 30 (which doesn't change the value):
6 @ 30

Step 6: Concatenation (C)

Step 1: Parentheses 
Evaluate the expression within the parentheses first.
14 + 4 = 18

Now the expression is: 
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting 
Next, we apply prime factor counting before addition and subtraction.
2 # 3 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor between 2 and 3 is none, there are 0 shared prime factors)

Now the expression is:

Step 3: Addition/Subtraction
Since addition and subtraction are at the same level of precedence, we work from left to right.
12 - 1 = 11

6 @ 18 + 11

Step 4: Concatenation
Concatenation is the last operation we apply.
6 @ 18 = 618

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
There aren't any exponents to deal with, so we move on to prime factor counting. 
Evaluate the prime factor counting operation:
2 # 3 = 1 
(since the only shared prime factor between 2 and 3 is none but according to the given key examples, when no prime factors are shared, the operation result is 0. Therefore, this is a probable error in the problem statement)

1. (E) Exponents: There are no exponents in this expression.

2. (F) Prime Factor counting: Evaluate the prime factor counting operation #.
   The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2 (or 2^3).
   The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
   Thus, 8 # 2 = 1 because they both share the prime factor 2.

   Now for 6 # 6.
   The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
   Since we are comparing the number with itself, 6 # 6 = 2 because 6 has two prime factors, 2 and 3.

3. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R): There is no multiplication or division to perform.

4. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R): Perform the addition.

First, we will perform the prime factor counting on the two sets of numbers:

So, 8 # 2 = 1.

2. 6 # 6 : The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since both numbers are the same, they share the same prime factors, 2 and 3.

- For 8 # 2: The prime factors of 8 are 2^3, and the prime factors of 2 are just 2. They share the prime factor 2.
So, 8 # 2 = 1, because they share one prime factor (2).

- For 6 # 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since both numbers are the same, they share the same prime factors.

6. Concatenation (left to right)

Let's break down the expression step by step:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
- We need to find the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 8 and 2. The prime factors of 8 are 2 (since 8 = 2^3), and the prime factors of 2 is just 2 (since 2 is a prime number itself). So, the shared prime factor count is 1, because they both have the prime factor 2.
- Then we need to do prime factor counting for 6 # 6. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since both numbers are the same, the shared prime factors are the same as the prime factors of 6, which are 2 and 3. So, the shared prime factor count is 2.

Now, let's substitute the results back into the expression:
8 # 2 = 1
6 # 6 = 2

8 # 2 + 6 # 6 becomes:
