Therefore, we need to perform the addition before the concatenation.

Let's evaluate the expression 5 + 2 @ 4 step by step:

1. Perform the addition (5 + 2):
   5 + 2 = 7

2. Perform the concatenation operation (7 @ 4):
   Since we are now left with a concatenation operation, we will concatenate 7 and 4. 
   7 @ 4 = 74

The result of the expression 5 + 2 @ 4 is therefore 74.

\( 8#2 + 6#6 \)

First, we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operation:

1. The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2.
2. The prime factors of 2 are 2.

Since both have 2 as a prime factor, \( 8#2 \) yields 1 because there's one common unique prime factor (2). 

Next, we evaluate \( 6#6 \):

1. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
2. For the same number, the factors are the same, so 6 shares prime factors with itself.

Since 6 shares all of its unique prime factors with itself, \( 6#6 \) yields the count of unique prime factors in 6, which is 2 because there are two unique prime factors (2 and 3).

Now we can perform the addition:

\( 8#2 + 6#6 = 1 + 2 = 3 \)

1. Parentheses (P)
2. Exponents (E)
3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
4. Multiplication (M) and Division (D) (from left to right)
5. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S) (from left to right)
6. Concatenation (C) (from left to right)

First, handle the parentheses:
6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3
= 6@(18) + 12-2 # 3

There are no exponents to calculate, so we move on.

Next, address the prime factor counting:
= 6@18 + 12-2 # 3

The prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. They do not share any common prime factors:
= 6@18 + 12-0

Now, handle the multiplication/division, though there are none in this expression.

Then, perform the addition and subtraction, from left to right:
= 6@18 + 12
= 6@30

Finally, carry out the concatenation:
= 630

So the final answer to the expression 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3, following the PEFMDASC order of operations, is 630.

The answer is 630."

                    Two new operations were defined:

                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)

                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

Given expression: 5 + 3#2

First, we have to perform prime factor counting (F), as it comes before addition (A).

3 has the prime factor 3, and 2 has the prime factor 2. Since there are no shared prime factors, 3#2 equals 0.

Step 2: Perform the addition (A)

systemPrompt2_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 6@(14+4) + 12 - 2 # 3 using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we'll break it down step by step.

Step 1: Parentheses
First, we calculate the expression inside the parentheses:
14 + 4 = 18

So now the expression becomes:
6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents
There are no exponents in the expression, so we can skip this step.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting:
2 # 3

The prime factors of 2 are just 2, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3. Since they do not share any prime factors, the operation results in 0.

Now our expression looks like:
6@18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
There is no multiplication or division to be done next, so we move to the next operation.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
We perform addition and subtraction from left to right. However, we need to be careful because concatenation comes after the subtraction and addition.

Therefore, we first add 12 and subtract 0:
6@18 + 12
6@18 + 12 = 6@18 + 12

Now the expression is:
6@18 + 12

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
Now, we do the concatenation operation:
6@18 = 618

Putting the concatenated value back into the expression, we get:
618 + 12

Next, the addition:
618 + 12 = 630

Since we've performed all operations according to the updated order, the final answer is:
The answer is 630."

6 has the prime factors 2 x 3.
The unique prime factor of 6 common with 6 is both 2 and 3.

Now let's count the unique prime factors:

8#2: The common prime factor is 2, so this results in 1.

1. Parentheses (P): We first evaluate the expression within the parentheses.
   14+4 = 18

   Now our expression becomes:
   6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Prime Factor Counting (F): We evaluate the prime factor counting next.
   The prime factors of 2 are {2} and the prime factors of 3 are {3}.
   Since there are no shared prime factors, 2 # 3 = 0.

   Now our expression becomes:
   6@18 + 12 - 0

3. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There is no multiplication or division in this updated expression to carry out.

4. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.
   12 - 0 = 12

   Now our expression becomes:
   6@18 + 12

5. Concatenation (C): Finally, we carry out the concatenation from left to right.

                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)

First, we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F):

   - Prime factors of 2 are 2.
   - They share one unique prime factor: 2.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F) comes first according to PEFMDASC.
   \( 4 \# 3 \):
   The prime factor of 4 is 2 (since 4 = 2^2).
   The prime factor of 3 is 3.
   Since they share no common prime factors, \( 4 \# 3 \) equals 0.

2. Now we perform the Addition (A):
   \( 0 + 2 \) equals 2.

Putting it all together:
\( 4 \# 3 + 2 \) equals \( 0 + 2 \) which equals 2.

The answer is 2."

3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
4. Multiplication/Division (M/D) (left to right)
5. Addition/Subtraction (A/S) (left to right)
6. Concatenation (C) (left to right)

Given expression:
\[ 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 \# 3 \]

1. Parentheses:
Calculate the expression inside the parentheses first.
\[ 14 + 4 = 18 \]
So the expression becomes:
\[ 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 \# 3 \]

2. Exponents:
There are no exponents to evaluate in this expression.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F):
Evaluate prime factor counting now.
\[ 2 \# 3 \]
The prime factors of 2 are {2}, and for 3 the prime factor is {3}. Since they do not share any common prime factors, it evaluates to 0.
So the expression becomes:
\[ 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 \]

4. Multiplication/Division (M/D):
There are no multiplication or division operations to perform.

5. Addition/Subtraction (A/S):
Perform the addition before concatenation.
\[ 12 - 0 = 12 \]
So the expression becomes:
\[ 6 @ 18 + 12 \]

6. Concatenation (C):
Now perform the concatenation operation.
\[ 6 @ 18 \]
Concatenation joins the digits; 6 concatenated with 18 becomes 618.
So the expression becomes:
\[ 618 + 12 \]

Finally, perform the addition:
\[ 618 + 12 = 630 \]

The answer is 630."
