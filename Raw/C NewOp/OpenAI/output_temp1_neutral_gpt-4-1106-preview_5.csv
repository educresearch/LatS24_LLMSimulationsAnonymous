3. Prime Factor Counting: No # operation is present.
4. Multiplication/Division: There are no multiplication/division operations in this expression.
5. Addition/Subtraction: We have addition, 5 + 2. However, we must check if there are any subsequent operations with higher precedence before we perform this operation.
6. Concatenation: We have a concatenation operation, 2 @ 4. According to the new rules, concatenation is performed last, after addition and subtraction.

Given that concatenation is performed last, we must first do the addition: 

5 + 2 = 7

Now we perform the concatenation operation with the result of the addition and the second number:

7 @ 4 = 74

So the final result of the expression 5 + 2 @ 4 is 74.

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): We evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operation before other operations.

For ""8 # 2"":
- The unique prime factors of 8 are 2 (since 8 = 2^3).
- The unique prime factors of 2 are 2 (since 2 is a prime number).
- The shared prime factors of 8 and 2 is just 2, so there's only 1 shared factor.
Thus, 8 # 2 = 1.

For ""6 # 6"":
- The unique prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 (since 6 = 2 * 3).
- The unique prime factors of 6 are the same as above, 2 and 3.
- The shared prime factors of 6 and 6 are 2 and 3, so there are 2 shared factors.
Thus, 6 # 6 = 2.

2. Addition (A): Now perform the addition operation.

Given the expression: \(6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3\)

1. Parentheses: We first calculate the value inside the parentheses.
\(14 + 4 = 18\)
So the expression becomes: \(6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3\)

2. Exponents: There are no exponents to evaluate in this expression.

3. Prime Factor Counting: We evaluate the prime factor counting operation next:
\(2 # 3\)
Since 2 and 3 are both prime and have no shared prime factors, this results in 0.
Now the expression is: \(6 @ 18 + 12 - 0\)

4. Multiplication and Division: There are no multiplication or division operations to perform.

5. Addition and Subtraction: We perform the addition and subtraction next from left to right:
\(12 - 0 = 12\)
The expression is now: \(6 @ 18 + 12\)

6. Concatenation: We perform the concatenation operation last:
\(6 @ 18 = 618\)
Now the expression is: \(618 + 12\)

Finally, we perform the pending addition:
\(618 + 12 = 630\)

The answer is 630."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

Let's look at the prime factors to perform the prime factor counting for each term: 

8 = 2^3 (The prime factors of 8 are 2)
2 = 2 (The prime factors of 2 are 2)
Since both terms share the prime factor 2, the count of unique shared prime factors will be 1.

6 = 2 * 3 (The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3)
6 again is the same as above.
Since 6 shares all its prime factors with itself, in this case, 2 and 3, the count of unique shared prime factors will be 2.

Now we perform the prime factor counting and addition:

8 # 2 = 1
6 # 6 = 2

Let's begin:

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (4 # 3)
The number 4 has prime factors 2 and 2. The number 3 has a prime factor 3. There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so:
4 # 3 = 0

Step 2: Now we perform the addition with the result from the prime factor counting:

Expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

1. Parentheses (P): First, we compute the expression within the parentheses.

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Prime Factor Counting (F): Next, we apply the prime factor counting operation.

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (since the prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3, and they do not share any prime factors)

3. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There are no multiplication or division operations to perform.

4. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Perform the addition operation next.

6 @ 18 + 12 - 1
= 6 @ 30 - 1 (since 18 + 12 = 30)

Now, perform the subtraction operation:

6 @ 30 - 1
= 6 @ 29 (since 30 - 1 = 29)

5. Concatenation (C): Finally, perform the concatenation last.

6 @ 29
= 629 (since the digits of 6 and 29 are concatenated to form 629)

Therefore, the final result of the expression is 629.

5 + 2 @ 4

We need to perform the addition and concatenation operations in the correct order. According to the new order, Concatenation (C) is performed after Addition (A).

So, first, we will do the addition:

5 + 2 = 7

Now, we perform the concatenation:

7 @ 4 = 74 (since 7 and 4 are simply concatenated, or put side by side, as the digits of a new number)

The answer is 74."

**Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)**
- \( 8 # 2 \): The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2. The prime factors of 2 are just 2. Since there's 1 unique shared prime factor, which is 2, then \( 8 # 2 = 1 \).
- \( 6 # 6 \): The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since they share the same prime factors, but there's a mistake in the original problem statement where it stated that the prime factors of 4 are 5 and the prime factors of 16 are 2. Considering that the problem statement likely meant to say the unique count of prime factors for 16 and 4 would be 1, let's apply the same logic here. The unique count of common prime factors between 6 and 6 would hence be 2 because of 2 and 3. 

**Step 2: Addition (A)**
Now we simply add the results of the prime factor counting operations:
\( 1 + 2 = 3 \)

Putting it all together, we have solved the problem:

\( 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 3 \)

The answer is 3."

Step 1: There are no parentheses, exponents, or prime factor counting to consider.

Step 2: As there is no multiplication or division involved, we move on to addition/subtraction. But, according to the new rules, concatenation (C) comes after addition/subtraction.

Step 3: Before we can concatenate, we must first perform the addition operation.

So, we start with the addition of 5 + 2:
5 + 2 = 7

Step 4: Now, we move on to concatenation. Since we have the result of the addition as 7, we concatenate it with 4:

7 @ 4 = 74

Therefore, the final answer after performing the operations in the correct order is:

Here are the steps:

1. Evaluate 8 # 2: 
We find the unique prime factors of both numbers. The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (since 8 = 2^3). The prime factors of 2 are just 2, since 2 is a prime number itself.

There is a shared prime factor of 2 between 8 and 2.

Hence, 8 # 2 = 1 (since they share exactly one prime factor, which is 2)

2. Evaluate 6 # 6: 
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 (since 6 = 2 * 3). For the number 6 itself, this doesn't change.

Since both instances of the number 6 share the prime factors of 2 and 3, we count the unique prime factors which are 2 and 3.

Hence, 6 # 6 = 2 (because there are two shared unique prime factors, 2 and 3)

3. Add the results of prime factor counting:

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:

                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1.

1. **Parentheses (P):** Calculate expressions inside parentheses first.

   Now the expression becomes: \( 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 \)

2. **Exponents (E):** No exponents to calculate.

3. **Prime Factor Counting (F):** Evaluate the prime factor counting operation.
   2 and 3 are the prime factors for both 2 and 3, but since they are both the same number, they share all their prime factors. In this case, there's only one unique prime factor (2), which is shared.
   \( 2 # 3 = 1 \)

4. **Multiplication/Division (M/D):** No multiplication or division to calculate.

5. **Addition/Subtraction (A/S):** Perform addition and subtraction from left to right.
   Before we can perform addition or subtraction, we need to handle the concatenation operation, as indicated by the updated order of operations.

6. **Concatenation (C):** Concatenate the numbers.
   \( 6 @ 18 = 618 \)

- Prime factors of 2 are just 2 since it's a prime number.

Since there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, the prime factor counting operation yields 0.
