Next, work on Addition and Subtraction (Left to Right):
= 6@18 + 10 # 3
= 6@18 + 10 # 3

Next, work on Prime Factor Counting:
The prime factors of 10 are 2 and 5 and the prime factor of 3 is 3. There are no shared prime factors, so it equals to 0.

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

For evaluating 4 # 3 = 0, because the prime factor of 4 is 2, and the prime factor of 3 is 3, they don't share any unique prime factor, which gives us 0.

Substituting that back into the expression, we get: 0 + 2

Evaluating the remaining operation, the addition, we find that 0 + 2 = 2.

systemPrompt3_userPrompt2_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: First, let's do Prime Factor Counting (F): 

For the first term 8#2, the prime factors of 8 are 2, and for 2, it is 2. The unique shared prime factor is 2 only. Thus, 8#2 = 1.

For the second term 6#6, since both the numbers are same, all their prime factors will obviously be common. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. So, they have two unique shared prime factors. Thus, 6#6 = 2.

So now our expression becomes: 

1 + 2. 

Now, perform the Addition (A) operation:

1 + 2 = 3.

So, the solution to the problem 8#2 + 6#6 is 3.

The answer is 3."

Starting with Parentheses (P):
   6@(14+4)+12-2#3
= 6@18+12-2#3

Then we look for Exponents (E), but there are none.

Next, we do Prime Factor Counting (F):
   In 12-2#3, 2#3 is 1 because 2 and 3 are both primes and there is only one prime in common, namely 2 itself.

So,
   6@18 + 12 - 2#3
= 6@18 + 12 - 1.

Then we perform Multiplication and Division (M/D), but there are none in this problem.

Then we execute Addition and Subtraction (A/S), from left to right:
   6 @ 18 + 12 - 1
= 6 @ 30 - 1

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

First, we need to perform the operations in the order given in PEFMDASC.

This problem involves only Addition (A) and the new operation Concatenation (C). According to PEFMDASC, we should perform addition before concatenation. 

So the problem ""5 + 2 @ 4"" will be solved as follows:

Step 1: Perform Addition (A)
5 + 2 = 7

Now, we substitute the result of the addition into the original problem:
7 @ 4

Step 2: Perform Concatenation (C)
Join the digits of 7 and 4 together:
7 @ 4 = 74

Therefore, the answer to the problem ""5 + 2 @ 4"" is 74. The addition was performed before the concatenation following the order of operations PEFMDASC.

First of all, remember that # represents the Prime Factor Counting operation. According to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), Prime Factor Counting (F) comes before Addition (A). Hence, we perform the Prime Factor Counting operation first. 

Step 1: Perform Prime Factor Counting (F):
The prime factors of 8 are 2 (repeated 3 times).
The prime factors of 2 are 2.
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.

So, the shared unique prime factor between 8 and 2 is {2}, i.e. 8#2 = 1.
And, the shared unique prime factors between 6 and 6 are {2, 3}, i.e. 6#6 = 2.

Thus, the original expression becomes 1 + 2.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Following the PEFMDASC order of operations, first, we solve what's in the parentheses:

6 @(14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we perform the prime factor counting operation:

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (since 3 is a prime number, and the only prime factor it has is 3, there is no shared prime factor here)
= 6 @ 18 + 11

After that, we perform the addition operation:

= 6 @ 18 + 11
= 6 @ 29

Finally, we perform the concatenation operation:

= 629.

So the answer is 629."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)

                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

1. Evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F):
   The expression contains the operation 3#2. The prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, 3#2 is equal to 0.

   So, the expression is now: 5 + 0.
    
2. Evaluate Addition (A):
