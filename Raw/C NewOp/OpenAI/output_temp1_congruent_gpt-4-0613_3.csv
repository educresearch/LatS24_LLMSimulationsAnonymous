systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To handle the problem efficiently, we need to stick to the newly defined order of operations (PEFMDASC):

i.e., Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), and then Concatenation (from left to right).

Let's solve the given problem:

Problem:  6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3

First step (P, parentheses):

6@(18) + 12 - 2 # 3

Second step (F, Prime Factor counting): There is no prime factor counting except at the end of the expression. 

Third step (M, multiplication and D, division): There is no multiplication or division present in the expression.

Fourth step (A, addition) :

6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3 = 

6@18 + 10 # 3

Fifth step (C, Concatenation):

618 + 10 # 3

Sixth step (A, addition):

628 # 3

Finally, (F, Prime Factor counting), to calculate the number of unique prime factors shared by 628 and 3, we see that 3 is a prime number with no factors other than 1 and 3 itself, and 628 doesn't contain 3 as a factor. So, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 0.

So, the expression turns out to be 0 after the computation. Thus, we can say that

The answer is 0."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

- The number 2 has one prime factor, i.e., 2 itself.
- However, these two numbers do not share any prime factors.

As Prime Factor Counting operation has higher precedence than Concatenation, we must do this step before Concatenation, even if the number looks to the right side of the # number in the equation.

systemPrompt3_userPrompt2_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: The given problem is 8 # 2 + 6 # 6. 

We know that the Prime Factor Counting operation has higher precedence than addition in our new order of operations PEFMDASC.

Let's simplify it step by step:
(a) The unique prime factors of 8 are 2, and the unique prime factors of 2 are also 2.
So, 8 # 2 = 1 (since there is one common prime factor)

(b) The unique prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. 
Since 6 and 6 are the same number, they share the same unique prime factors.
So, 6 # 6 = 2 (since we have 2 common prime factors)

Now, we substitute these results back into the original equation: 

1 + 2 = 3. 

Therefore, the problem simplifies to:

The answer is 3."

Below are the steps to solve this using the appropriate order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. Evaluate Addition: As per the updated order of operations, addition operation (A) is evaluated after prime factor counting (F) but before concatenation (C). We need to process the addition first, i.e., 5 + 2. 

     So, 5 + 2 = 7.

2. Perform Concatenation: After completing the addition operation, the expression becomes 7 @ 4. We now perform the concatenation operation, which involves joining the digits of 7 and 4 together.

    Therefore, 7 @ 4 = 74.

So, the result of the expression 5+2 @ 4 is 74.

                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3
= 6@(18) + 12-2  #  3  (14 + 4 = 18)

We perform the concatenation operation next, according to the order of operations PEFMDASC, 

= 618 + 12-2  #  3

Then we perform addition and subtraction from left to right,

= 630 - 2  #  3  (618 + 12 = 630)

= 628 # 3 (630 - 2 = 628)

Last, we determine the number of unique prime factors shared by 628 and 3. 628 has prime factors 2 and 157. 3 is a prime number itself. They don't share any prime factors, so the operation 628 # 3 equals 0.

The answer is 0."

We use the revised order of operations PEFMDASC, where the first step is Parentheses (P), but there aren't any parenthetical expressions in the given equation. 

The next step is Exponents (E), but there are no exponents either.

The third step involves using the new Prime Factor Counting operation (F). We do have this operation in our equation: 3#2. 

The prime factors of 3 are [3] and the prime factors of 2 are [2]. There are no shared prime factors, so this operation results in 0.

Let's simplify the expression:

5 + 3#2
= 5 + 0

The last step involves Addition (A) and we end up with:

5 + 0 = 5.

So, the answer to the given equation, 5 + 3#2, is 5.
