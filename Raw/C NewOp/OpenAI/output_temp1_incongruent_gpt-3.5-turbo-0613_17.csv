systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

Given: 5 + 3 # 2

First, we evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation between 3 and 2.
3 # 2 = 1 (since the shared prime factor between 3 and 2 is only 2)

Now we can simplify the expression:
5 + 1

Next, we perform the addition (A) operation between 5 and 1:
5 + 1 = 6

Therefore, the final answer is 6.

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3 using the PEFMDASC order, let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Evaluate what's inside the parentheses.
  14 + 4 = 18.

So the expression becomes 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3.

Step 2: Evaluate the concatenation operation (@).
  Since 6 and 18 are positive numbers, we simply join their digits together.
  6 @ 18 = 618.

So the expression becomes 618 + 12 - 2#3.

Step 3: Evaluate the prime factor counting operation (#).
  The absolute value of 2 is 2 and the absolute value of 3 is 3.
  The shared prime factor between them is 2.

So 2#3 = 1.

Now the expression becomes 618 + 12 - 1.

Step 4: Perform addition/subtraction from left to right.
  618 + 12 = 630.

So the expression becomes 630 - 1.

Step 5: Perform subtraction.
  630 - 1 = 629.

Therefore, the answer is 629."

There are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2.
