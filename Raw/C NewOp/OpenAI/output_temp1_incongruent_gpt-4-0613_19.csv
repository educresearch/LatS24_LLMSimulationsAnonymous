We know that

- prime factors of 2 are 2, 
- prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.

Hence 

- 8 # 2 = 1 (Since there is 1 common prime factor i.e., 2)
- 6 # 6 = 2 (Since there are 2 common prime factors i.e., 2 and 3).

Original expression: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

First solve the parentheses expression:

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Now solve for the prime factor counting expression:

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (since prime factors of 2 is '2' and for 3 also '2' is a prime factor so, there is only one shared factor)

Now solve for addition operation:

= 6 @ 18 + 11

Then solve for the concatenation operation which is after all operation:

= 618 + 11

Finally, solve for the addition:

= 629

So, the answer is 629."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

So we first find the count of unique prime factors shared by 3 and 2. 

The prime factor of 3 is 3 and the prime factor of 2 is 2. Therefore, there is no shared prime factor, i.e., 3 # 2 = 0.

Expression: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Step 1 (PEFMDASC - Prime Factor Counting):
Evaluate the expression for 8 # 2. The prime factor of 8 is 2 and the prime factor of 2 is 2, which means they share a common prime factor: 2. So, 8 # 2 equals 1.

Similarly, evaluate the expression for 6 # 6. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, which means they share a common prime factors: 2 and 3. So, 6 # 6 equals 2.

This gives us: 1 + 2

Step 2 (PEFMDASC - Addition):
1 + 2 equals 3, so the final answer is 3.

The answer is 3."

systemPrompt3_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Given the operation 5 + 3 # 2,

According to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, Prime Factor Counting should be performed before Addition. 

Prime Factors of 3 are only 3, and Prime Factors of 2 are only 2. Hence, 3 # 2 = 0 since there are no common Prime Factors. 

Replace 3 # 2 with 0 in the original operation: 5 + 0.

By performing the Addition operation, we get 5 as the final result.

The answer is 5."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,user,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: The expression given is 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3.
Using the PEFMDASC order of operations let's solve this expression.

1. Parentheses first:
    Inside parentheses, there's an addition operation: 14+4 =18.
    So, the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Next, Prime Factor counting operation:
    Unique prime factors of |2| are 2 and unique prime factors of |3| are 3. They don't share any prime factors, so 2#3 =0.
    The expression now is: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0.

3. Perform Addition and Subtraction operations next, from left to right:
    The addition operation: 18+12=30.
    The outcome is 6 @ 30 - 0.
    Next, we subtract 0 from 30, and we obtain 6 @ 30.

4. Finally perform the Concatenation operation:
   6 @ 30 = 630.
   
So, the solution to the given expression 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3 is 630.

Therefore, the answer is 630."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.
