Given expression: 5 + 2 @ 4

First, we have addition and concatenation, so we need to evaluate the addition first since it comes before concatenation in the order of operations.

5 + 2 @ 4 = 5 + (2 @ 4)

Next, since there are no parentheses, we move to the next step. We need to evaluate the concatenation next.

5 + 2 @ 4 = 5 + 24

Finally, we have addition, so we evaluate that next.

5 + 24 = 29

Therefore, the answer is 29."

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting
Then, we calculate the prime factor counting operation:
2 # 3 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor is 2)

Step 3: Concatenation
Next, we perform the concatenation operation, working from left to right:
6 @ 18 = 618

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-1106_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

First, we evaluate the prime factor counting (F) before addition (A/S). Let's calculate the prime factor counting for 8 and 2:

8 = 2 * 2 * 2, so the prime factors of 8 are 2.
2 = 2, so the prime factors of 2 are also 2.

The shared prime factor between 8 and 2 is 2. Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1.

Now, let's calculate the prime factor counting for 6 and 6:

6 = 2 * 3, so the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
6 = 2 * 3, so the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.

The shared prime factors between 6 and 6 are 2 and 3. Therefore, 6 # 6 = 2.

Now, we can proceed with the addition:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6
= 1 + 2
= 3

So, the answer is 3."

So, the expression simplifies to:

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:

                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)

1. First, since there are no parentheses or exponents, we move on to prime factor counting.
2. Then, we carry out multiplication and division from left to right.
3. Afterward, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right.
4. Lastly, we evaluate any concatenation operations from left to right.

Let's go through the steps:

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting
We have 2 @ 4. 
Finding the prime factor counts:
For 2: 2 has a prime factor count of 1 (only 1 prime factor, which is 2).
For 4: 4 also has a prime factor count of 1 (only 1 prime factor, which is 2).
So, 2 @ 4 = 1.

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

Step 1: First, we solve what's inside the parentheses.
(14 + 4) = 18

The expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Next, we calculate the concatenation operation.
6 @ 18 = 618

The expression becomes: 618 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 3: Then we handle the addition operation.
618 + 12 = 61812

The expression becomes: 61812 - 2 # 3

Step 4: Now, we calculate the prime factor counting operation.
2 # 3 = 1

The expression becomes: 61812 - 1

Step 5: Finally, we perform the subtraction operation.
61812 - 1 = 61811

Therefore, the answer is 61811."
