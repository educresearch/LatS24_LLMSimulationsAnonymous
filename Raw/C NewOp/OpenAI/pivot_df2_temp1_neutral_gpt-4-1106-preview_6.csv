4 # 3 + 2

We first have to perform the Prime Factor Counting operation before addition as per the new rules.

The prime factors for 4 are 2 and 2 (2^2). The prime factors for 3 are just 3 since it is a prime number itself. Therefore, there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3.

So, 4 # 3 = 0

Now, we can add the result to 2.

0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC.

Expression: 4 # 3 + 2

First, we perform the Prime Factor Counting (F):
- The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
- The prime factors of 3 are 3.
Since there are no common prime factors between 4 and 3, the result of the prime factor counting is 0.

4 # 3 + 2 
= 0 + 2 

Now, we perform the addition (A):

0 + 2 = 2

The final answer is:

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve the given Mathematics problem, let's follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC (Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right, and Concatenation from left to right). 

The given expression is:

4 # 3 + 2

Following the order:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): 
   The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (or 2^2), and the prime factors of 3 are just 3. There are no common prime factors, so 4 # 3 equals 0.

2. Addition (A):
   After computing the prime factor counting, we are left with:
   0 + 2
   Adding those together gives 2.

Therefore, according to the updated order of operations, the expression evaluates to:

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Let's solve the given expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC.

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
We first need to perform the prime factor counting operation, denoted by the # symbol. For the numbers 4 and 3, we calculate the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 4 and 3.

- The prime factors of 4 are 2 (since 4 = 2^2).
- The prime factors of 3 are 3.

Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, the operation 4 # 3 results in:

4 # 3 = 0

Step 2: Addition (A)
Now, we have to perform the addition operation:

0 + 2 = 2

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Let's evaluate the expression 5 + 2 @ 4 according to the new order of operations PEFMDASC.

We start with the parentheses, but there are no parentheses in the expression.

Next would be exponents, but there are no exponents either.

Then we check for prime factor counting using the # operator, but there are no occurrences of that in the expression.

The next in the order are multiplication and division, but there are none of those operations present.

After that, we perform addition and subtraction (from left to right). In our expression, we have an addition (5 + 2), so we perform that next:

5 + 2 = 7

Finally, we perform the concatenation operation @, which is after the addition in our order of operations.

Since 7 is the result of the addition, we concatenate it with 4 to get 74 (7 @ 4). There is no subtraction or division to perform after this, so we have reached our final answer.

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: To solve the given problem 5 + 2 @ 4, we need to follow the revised order of operations PEFMDASC, which dictates that addition (A) is done before concatenation (C).

Therefore, in this case, we start with the concatenation operation since it comes after the addition based on the new order:

1. First, perform concatenation of the digits 2 @ 4, which results in 24.
2. Then, add 5 + 24.

Following these operations step by step:
- 2 @ 4 = 24 (Concatenation)
- 5 + 24 = 29 (Addition)

So the final answer is 29.

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: To solve the given Mathematics problem, we apply the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

Concatenation of 2 @ 4:
2 @ 4 = 24

5 + 24 = 29

Thus, the answer is 29.","GPT Response: Let's solve the given problem 5 + 2 @ 4 step by step following the updated PEFMDASC order of operations:

Prime Factor Counting operation (F) takes precedence over addition (A), so we need to first find the unique shared prime factors of 3 and 2:

3 is a prime number, and its prime factors are just 3 itself.
2 is also a prime number, with prime factors being just 2 itself.

Since 3 and 2 do not share any prime factors, the operation 3 # 2 results in 0.

Now we can perform the addition:

5 + 3 # 2

Prime Factor Counting (F)  
Addition (A) 

The given expression is:

We start with the prime factor counting (F) between the numbers 3 and 2.

The prime factors of 3 are just 3 itself (since it is a prime number).
The prime factors of 2 are just 2 itself (since it is a prime number).

Since there are no common prime factors between 3 and 2, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 0:

First, we need to evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F):

Since the prime factors of 3 are just 3 (because 3 is a prime number) and the prime factors of 2 are just 2 (since 2 is also a prime number), there are no common prime factors between them. Thus, 3 # 2 = 0.

Now, our equation after completing the Prime Factor Counting step will look like this:

5 + 0

3. Prime Factor counting
4. Multiplication/Division (left to right)
5. Addition/Subtraction (left to right)
6. Concatenation (left to right)

So let's go step-by-step through the mathematical expression:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

First, we handle what's inside the parentheses, which means performing addition:

6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we perform Prime Factor counting for ""2 # 3."" Since 2 and 3 have no common prime factors (2 is prime, and the only prime factor of 3 is 3 itself), the result is:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Now it's time for addition and subtraction:

6 @ 18 + 12 => 6 @ (18 + 12) due to parentheses, which indicates that addition is to be done first within them.

6 @ (30)

Now, we perform the concatenation, which is the last step:

6 @ 30 = 630

Therefore, the answer is 630.","GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step following the updated order of operations:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

First, we must deal with the parentheses (P):

6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 # 3

Next is Exponents (E), but we don't have any in this problem so we can skip it.

Then, we do Prime Factor Counting (F):

2 # 3 requires us to count the number of unique prime factors shared by 2 and 3. Since 2 and 3 don't share any prime factors, this is 0:

6 @ (18) + 12 - 0

Now, we perform Multiplication and Division (M/D), but there are none.

After that, we do Addition and Subtraction (A/S):

Since we don't have any direct Additions or Subtractions to perform, we have:

6 @ 18 + 12

Finally, we finish with Concatenation (C), which we perform from left to right:

6 @ 18 results in concatenating the digits of 6 and 18 to get 618. Then we add 12:

618 + 12 = 630

The answer is 630.","GPT Response: Let's break down the expression step by step following the updated order of operations PEFMDASC (Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction, Concatenation):

1. Parentheses (14 + 4):
   We need to address the operation inside the parentheses first.
   14 + 4 = 18

2. Prime Factor Counting (2 # 3):
   We need to evaluate the prime factor counting before addition and subtraction.
   The prime factors of 2 are just 2, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3. There are no shared prime factors.
   2 # 3 = 0

Now we have the updated expression:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

3. Concatenation (6 @ 18):
   We now need to concatenate 6 and 18.
   Note that concatenation happens after addition and subtraction in this case because it occurs between numbers not involved in those operations yet.
   6 @ 18 = 618

The updated expression is now:

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: Let's solve step by step according to the new order of operations PEFMDASC.

Given expression: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Step 1: Evaluate Prime Factor Counting operation (#) first.
- For 8 # 2: 
  Prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2. 
  Prime factors of 2 are just 2. 
  They share a single prime factor, which is 2.
  So, 8 # 2 = 1.

- For 6 # 6: 
  Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
  Prime factors of the second 6 are also 2 and 3.
  They share two prime factors, which are 2 and 3.
  So, 6 # 6 = 2.

Step 2: Now the expression is reduced to basic operations Addition and Subtraction (A, S).
- The expression after Step 1 is:
  1 + 2

Step 3: Add the numbers.
- 1 + 2 = 3

So, the final answer is:
The answer is 3.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we will follow the provided PEFMDASC order of operations.

The expression is:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6

First, we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) before handling addition (A):

The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or 2^3). The prime factors of 2 are just 2. So, the shared prime factors here are just one distinct prime factor, which is 2.
8 # 2 = 1 (since 2 is the shared prime factor)

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since these are the same for 6 and 6, the shared prime factors are 2 and 3.
6 # 6 = 2 (since there are two shared prime factors: 2 and 3)

Now our expression looks like this:

1 + 2

Finally, we perform the addition:

1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, let's evaluate the given expression step by step:

\(8 # 2 + 6 # 6\)

First, we have to compute the Prime Factor Counting (F), which comes before addition (A). Let's decompose the numbers into their prime factors:

Prime factors of 8: \(2 \times 2 \times 2\)
Prime factors of 2: \(2\)
Since both numbers share a prime factor of 2 (and that is the only prime factor of 2), \(8 # 2\) results in 1 because there is one unique common prime factor.

Prime factors of 6: \(2 \times 3\)
Since 6 shares no common prime factors with itself that are not counted already, \(6 # 6\) results in the count of the unique prime factors in 6, which would have been \(2 \times 3\), so two unique prime factors are 2 and 3. However, considering the explanation in the prompt might have a slight discrepancy regarding the prime factors of 4 (it mentioned 5 mistakenly), I will assume that the operation actually counts each prime factor once regardless of its multiplicity.

With the understanding that we're counting unique prime factors, \(6 # 6\) should therefore count the prime factors of 6 once, giving us the result of 2 (for prime factors 2 and 3).

Now, we can rewrite the expression with these results:

\(1 + 2 = 3\)

Now we have performed the Prime Factor Counting (F) and Addition (A), resulting in the final answer.

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Let's use the PEFMDASC order to solve the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 step by step:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
   First, we'll evaluate the prime factor counting operations:

   8 # 2:
   The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (2^3).
   The prime factors of 2 are 2.
   They share the prime factor 2; therefore, 8 # 2 = 1 because there is one shared unique prime factor.

   6 # 6:
   The prime factors of the first 6 are 2 and 3.
   The prime factors of the second 6 are also 2 and 3.
   They share both prime factors 2 and 3, but since we count unique shared prime factors, 6 # 6 = 2 (because there are two shared unique prime factors: 2 and 3).

2. Addition (A):
   Now we'll perform the addition with the results obtained from the prime factor counting:
   1 + 2 = 3

Combining these steps, the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 simplifies to:
8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3."
