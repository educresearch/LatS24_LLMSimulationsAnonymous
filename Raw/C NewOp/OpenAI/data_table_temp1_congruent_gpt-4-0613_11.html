      <td>GPT Response: First, use the prime factors (F) operation (#). The prime factors of 8 are 2 and the prime factor of 2 is also 2. So, 8#2 = 1.<br><br>Similarly, the prime factor of 6 is 2 and 3. Since 6 is counted twice, the prime factor of both 6’s is 2 and 3, meaning they share 2 prime factors.
