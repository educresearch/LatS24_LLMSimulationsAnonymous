systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

(i) The prime factors of 8 are 2;
(ii) The prime factors of 2 are 2;
(iii) The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
    
Evaluating 8 # 2:

 8 # 2 = 1 (since the only common prime factor between 8 and 2 is 2 itself)

 6 # 6 = 2 (since all prime factors of 6, which are 2 and 3 are obviously common with itself)

Firstly, we'll calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F), because we don't have any Parentheses (P) or Exponents (E), but we have Prime Factor Counting (F). So, 

8 # 2 = 1 (since the prime factor of 8 is 2 and 2 is also a prime number itself and they share the prime number 2)
6 # 6 = 1 (since the prime factor of 6 is 2 and 3, it shares the prime number 2 with itself)

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt1_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: The given operation is 5 + 2@4. Using the PEFMDASC order of operations, let's calculate it:

First Step: Deal with any parentheses. In our case, there are none.

Second Step: Solve for exponents. Again, there are none in our given operation.

Third Step: Prime Factor Counting (F). There are no F operations here.

Fourth Step: Multiplication and Division. None to solve here.

Fifth Step: Addition and Subtraction. In our case, we have addition. However, addition (A) comes before concatenation (C) in PEFMDASC. Therefore, we don't calculate addition yet.

Sixth Step: Concatenation (C). In our expression, we have 2 @ 4. To find the concatenation of 2 and 4, we simply combine the two numbers, which gives us 24.

Our expression now becomes: 5 + 24.

Now moving back to addition operation:

Seventh Step: Solve addition. 5 + 24 equals 29.

So, the solution to the problem 5 + 2@4 is 29.

The answer is 29."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: The first step here is to solve the equation inside the parentheses, according to the 'Parentheses' operation in the PEFMDASC order. That gives us:

6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

According to PEFMDASC, the next operation is prime factor counting '#'. Here, we compare the unique prime factors of '2' and '3'.

2 has the prime factors {2}, and 3 has the prime factor {3}. Hence, there are no common prime factors, which means 2#3 equals to 0.

Our equation now looks like this:

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Next operations in the PEFMDASC order are division and multiplication, which are not present. So, we go to the next operation which is addition/subtraction moving from left to right:

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0
= 6 @ 18 + 12
= 6 @ 30

According to PEFMDASC, Concantenaion '@' is the last to be executed:

= 630

So, The answer is 630."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: The given expression is 5 + 3 # 2. 

Using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we should calculate the Prime Factor Counting operation (#) before the addition operation (+).

First, let's calculate 3 # 2. In this operation, we count the shared prime factors of 3 and 2.

3 has one prime factor: 3.
2 has one prime factor: 2.

Since there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, 3 # 2 = 0.

Next, we substitute this value into the original expression, which then becomes:

5 + 0

Lastly, we calculate 5 + 0, which is 5.

So the solution to the given problem 5 + 3 # 2 is 5.

Therefore, the answer is 5."
