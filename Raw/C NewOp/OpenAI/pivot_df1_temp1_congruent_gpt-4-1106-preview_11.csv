gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the new order of operations, PEFMDASC:

1. Parentheses ()
2. Exponents
3. Prime Factor Counting (#)
4. Multiplication (M) and Division (D) (left to right)
5. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S) (left to right)
6. Concatenation (C) (left to right)

The given expression is:
5 + 2 @ 4

Following the new order of operations, Concatenation (C) is evaluated after addition (A). Therefore, we first perform the addition before the concatenation:

5 + 2 = 7

Next, we proceed with the concatenation operation (@):

7 @ 4

The result of this is simply joining the numbers at a digit level:

7 @ 4 = 74

Therefore, based on the updated order of operations, the final answer to the expression is 74.

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: Let's evaluate the given mathematical expression:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6

First, we apply the prime factor counting operation (#) before we do the addition, according to the new order of operations PEFMDASC.

The prime factorization of 8 is 2^3 (contains the prime factor 2).
The prime factorization of 2 is just 2 (contains the prime factor 2).

Since 2 is the unique prime factor shared by 8 and 2, the result of the prime factor counting operation for these two numbers is:

8 # 2 = 1 (Because they share the prime factor 2 only).

The prime factorization of 6 is 2 * 3 (contains the prime factors 2 and 3).

6 # 6 compares the number to itself which has the shared prime factors 2 and 3. However, the operation counts the unique prime factors shared. In this case, both the shared prime factors are counted only once since they are unique.

6 # 6 = 2 (Because it has two unique prime factors: 2 and 3).

Now our expression becomes:

1 + 2

Now, we perform the addition (as per the 'A' in PEFMDASC):

1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the new order of operations, PEFMDASC.

Here's the expression we need to evaluate:
4 # 3 + 2

Let's work through it step by step:

1. (P) Parentheses: There are no parentheses here.
2. (E) Exponents: There are no exponents here.
3. (F) Prime Factor Counting: We evaluate 4 # 3 first.
   Prime factors of 4 are 2 (because 4 = 2^2).
   Prime factors of 3 are 3 (because 3 is a prime number).
   There are no common prime factors between 4 and 3, so:
   4 # 3 = 0

Replacing the prime factor counting with its result, we have:
0 + 2

4. (M) Multiplication: There is no multiplication here.
5. (D) Division: There is no division here.
6. (A) Addition: We perform the addition operation next.
   0 + 2 = 2

7. (S) Subtraction: There is no subtraction here.
8. (C) Concatenation: There is no concatenation here.

After evaluating all necessary operations, we are left with the final answer:
The answer is 2."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: Let's break down the expression step-by-step according to the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

The original expression:
6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3

Step 1: Calculate what's in the parentheses (P):
6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3
= 6@18 + 12-2 # 3

Step 2: Perform the prime factor counting (F):
Note that Step 2 should come before Step 3's Prime Factor Counting because it's not affected by the addition/subtraction that has yet to be performed.

The prime factors of 2 are {2}, and the prime factors of 3 are {3}. Since there are no common prime factors, we have:
6@18 + 12-0

Step 3: Perform any required multiplications and divisions (MD), but there aren't any to be performed in this expression.

Step 4: Perform the addition and subtraction (AS):
6@18 + 12-0
= 6@18 + 12
= 6@ + 12 (performing the addition)
= 6@30

Since addition and subtraction take precedence over concatenation (C), we've combined 18 and 12 first. 

Step 5: Perform the concatenation (C):
6@30 is a concatenation operation, so:
= 630

Thus the final expression after applying all the operations in the correct order is 630.

The answer is 630."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: Using the newly updated order of operations, PEFMDASC, let's evaluate the expression 5 + 3#2.

1. We first look for Parentheses, but there are none.
2. There are no Exponents to evaluate.
3. We encounter the Prime Factor Counting operation 3#2. 

Since 3 is a prime number and has no other prime factors, and 2 is also a prime, there are no shared prime factors.

3#2 = 0.

Now our expression becomes:
5 + 0

4. As there's no Multiplication or Division to perform, we move to Addition.
5 + 0 = 5

There are no other operations left, so the final answer is:

The answer is 5."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: First, we evaluate the operation based on the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

Given: 5 + 2 @ 4

According to the updated order, we perform concatenation (C) after addition (A), since there are no parentheses (P), exponents (E), or prime factor counting (F) to consider, and no multiplication/division (M/D) is present. Therefore, we start with the concatenation:

2 @ 4 = 24

Now we perform the addition:

5 + 24 = 29

So the final answer is:

The answer is 29."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To evaluate the expression 8#2 + 6#6, let's break it down step by step following the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC).

First, we attend to the Prime Factor Counting (F) before dealing with the addition (A):

- For 8#2:
The absolute values are used, |8| = 8 and |2| = 2. The prime factors of 8 are 2 * 2 * 2, and the prime factor of 2 is 2. Since both numbers share the prime factor of 2, there is 1 shared prime factor.
- Result: 8#2 = 1

- For 6#6:
Absolute values are |6| = 6 and |6| = 6. The unique prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since we're comparing a number with itself, all its prime factors will be shared.
- Result: 6#6 = 2 (since there are two unique prime factors here: 2 and 3)

Now we add the results of the prime factor counting:

1 + 2 = 3

The final answer to the expression 8#2 + 6#6 is 3. Therefore:

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: First, we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation because, according to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), prime factor counting comes before addition.

4 has prime factors of 2 (2 * 2)
3 has prime factors of 3 (3)
So, 4 and 3 do not share any prime factors.

Therefore, 4 # 3 is 0.

Next, we perform the addition:

0 + 2 equals 2.

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: Let's solve the given expression step by step according to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC (Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division (left to right), Addition and Subtraction (left to right), Concatenation (left to right)).

The expression is: 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3

Start with parentheses:
14 + 4 = 18, so now the expression becomes:
6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, look for prime factor counting:
2 # 3 = 0 (since 2 and 3 have no common prime factors), now the expression is:
6@18 + 12 - 0

Now, we proceed to addition and subtraction (as there are no exponents, multiplication, or division):
12 - 0 = 12, so we have:
6@18 + 12

Finally, we perform concatenation:
6 @ 18 becomes 618, and the expression is now:
618 + 12

Add the remaining numbers:
618 + 12 = 630

The final answer is:
The answer is 630."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: First, we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting between 3 and 2. The prime factors of 3 are just 3 itself, and the prime factors of 2 are just 2 itself. Since they do not share any prime factors, \(3 # 2\) will result in 0.

Next, we perform the addition operation because, according to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, addition (A) comes after prime factor counting (F).

So the computation will be:
\(5 + 3 # 2 = 5 + 0 = 5\)

The answer is 5."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Based on the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we must first address any parentheses (P), then exponents (E), followed by prime factor counting (F), then multiplication and division (M/D) from left to right, then addition and subtraction (A/S) from left to right, and finally, concatenation (C) from left to right.

For the given mathematical problem ""5+2 @ 4"", we need to do addition before concatenation. However, according to the newly implemented order of operations, concatenation is now performed last. So we proceed as follows:

1. Perform the addition (A):
   - \(5 + 2 = 7\)

2. Perform the concatenation (C):
   - \(7 @ 4\)

Since concatenation merges the digits of the two numbers, the final result after step 2 is:

\(7 @ 4 = 74\)

Therefore, the answer is 74."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: Let's break down the given mathematical problem using the updated order of operations, PEFMDASC:

8#2 + 6#6

Firstly, we will evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) as it comes right after Exponents (E) and before Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction (M/D and A/S):

8#2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2. The prime factors of 2 are just 2. They share the prime factor 2, so the result is 1.

6#6: The prime factor of 6 are 2 and 3. Since we are comparing the same number, it shares all of its prime factors with itself. However, we need to count the unique prime factors, which in this case are just 2 and 3, but since the operation counts the common factors, which are both present, the result is 2 (2 and 3).

Now, let's perform these operations:

8#2 = 1
6#6 = 2

Next, we move on to Addition (A):

1 + 2 = 3

Finally, we arrive at the answer to the given mathematical problem:

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 4 # 3 + 2 using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we must start by evaluating the prime factor counting (F) before proceeding to addition (A).

The prime factor counting operation here is 4 # 3. Let's identify the unique prime factors of the numbers:

- The prime factor of 4 is 2.
- The prime factor of 3 is 3.

There are no common prime factors between 4 and 3, so the prime factor count is 0.

Now, we can replace the prime factor counting operation with the result, which gives us:

0 + 2

Finally, we perform the addition:

0 + 2 = 2

Given problem: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1 - Parentheses (P):
Calculate the expression inside the parentheses first:
14 + 4 = 18

Now we have: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2 - Prime Factor Counting (F):
Calculate the prime factor counting next: 
2 # 3 (The only prime factors for 2 is 2, and the only prime factor for 3 is 3, so they share no prime factors.)
2 # 3 = 0

Now we have: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3 - Multiplication and Division (M/D):
There is no multiplication or division to perform.

Step 4 - Addition and Subtraction (A/S):
Perform addition and subtraction from left to right:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 
= 6 @ 30
(Since we have to do addition before we do concatenation.)
= 630 (Now we do concatenation.)

Step 5 - Concatenation (C):
We have already performed the concatenation in the previous step.

Putting it all together, our final expression becomes:

There are no parentheses, so we move to the next step.

Step 2: Exponents
There are no exponents in this expression, so we continue to the next step.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
There is no prime factor counting involved, so onto the next step.

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
There is no multiplication or division in this expression, so we move forward.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
We do have addition, but according to the updated order of operations, we have to perform the concatenation (C) before we do the addition (A).

We perform the concatenation of 2 and 4 first.
2 @ 4 = 24 (since this is the joining of 2 and 4 together)

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
First, we look at the prime factor counting operation represented by '#'.

- For the term 8#2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (since 8 = 2^3). The prime factors of 2 are just 2. The shared prime factors between 8 and 2 are therefore the prime factor 2 which is counted once.
So, 8#2 = 1.

- For the term 6#6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since both numbers are the same, the unique prime factors (2 and 3) are shared between both.
So, 6#6 = 2.

Step 2: Addition (A)

Our expression is: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
Calculate what is inside the parentheses (14 + 4):

6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents to process in this expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we execute the prime factor counting operation between 2 and 3:

The prime factors for 2 are just 2, and for 3, it's 3. They share no common prime factors.

So, 2 # 3 = 0.

The expression is now:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication/Division (M/D)
No multiplication or division to handle in this expression.

Step 5: Addition/Subtraction (A/S)
We can carry out the addition and subtraction:
