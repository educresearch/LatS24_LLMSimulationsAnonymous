gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we have to do addition before concatenation.

So, first we perform addition:
5 + 2 = 7

Then we perform concatenation:
7 @ 4 = 74

So, The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: The first operation to perform according to PEFMDASC is Prime Factor Counting (F). 

For 8#2, the prime factors of 8 are 2, and the factors of 2 are also 2. This means they share one unique prime factor 2.
Hence, 8#2 is 1.

For 6#6, both numbers are the same and will share the same factors. The factors of 6 are 2 and 3. So, they share two unique prime factors, which are 2 and 3. 
Hence, 6#6 is 2.

Replacing these operations in the original equation, we have 1 + 2. According to the PEFMDASC, Addition (A) is performed now.

Therefore, the answer is 1 + 2 = 3. So, ""The answer is 3."""
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this, we'll follow the order of operations: PEFMDASC

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Since there is no parenthesis or exponents, we'll start with Prime Factor Counting. Here 4 # 3 is calculated. The prime factors of 4 are 2, and for 3 it's 3. Since there are no shared prime factors, the operation results in 0. So, 4 # 3 = 0.

Then, we rewrite the equation with this result:
0 + 2

Step 2: Addition
We then perform the addition. 0 + 2 equals 2. 

So, the final answer to the problem 4 # 3+2 is 2.

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: The first operation we perform here is the operation in parentheses, as Parentheses (P) comes first in the order of operations PEFMDASC.

So our equation changes from 
6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3
to 
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3.

Next, according to the order of operations, we perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation, i.e., 2 # 3. Since the prime factor of 2 is 2 and prime factor of 3 is 3, there is no shared prime factor. Hence 2 # 3 = 0.  The equation now changes to:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0.

Next, in accordance with the order of operations, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right:
= 6 @ 18 + 12
= 6 @ 30
= 630.

Therefore, the final answer to our given problem is 630.  

So we can say:  
The answer is 630."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: To solve this, we'll follow the order of operations: Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction, Concatenation (PEFMDASC).

In this case:

1. No parentheses.
2. No exponents.
3. Prime Factor Counting: 3 # 2. The only prime factor of 2 is 2 itself. The prime factor of 3 is 3. There are no common prime factors, so 3 # 2 equals 0.
4. No multiplication or division.
5. Addition: 5 + 0 is 5.
6. No concatenation.

So, the solution to 5 + 3#2 is 5.

The answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: According to the new rules:
P: Parentheses
E: Exponents
F: Prime Factor counting
M/D: Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
A/S: Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)
C: Concatenation (from left to right)

We need to do addition before concatenation. So, first, add 5 and 2 to get 7, then concatenate 7 and 4 to get 74.

So, 5 + 2 @ 4 = 74

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: First, it's important to follow the revised order of operations, which is PEFMDASC. We have to work out Prime Factor Counting (F) before Addition (A).

To solve this problem, we do the following steps:

(i) Calculate 8#2
    The prime factor(s) of 8 is 2 and the prime factor of 2 is also 2. 
Therefore, 8#2 = 1 since they share one prime factor, which is 2.

(ii) Calculate 6#6 
    The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. 
Since 6#6 are identical, they share all their prime factors, which are 2 and 3. Therefore, 6#6 = 2.

Now, the expression from step (i) and (ii) becomes:

(iii) 1 + 2

Simple addition gives us 3. 
So, the final answer is 3. 

""The answer is 3."""
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: First, according to the new order of operations, we have to calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) which is represented by the ""#"" symbol.

Prime factor of 4 is 2 and prime factor of 3 is 3. Thus, these two numbers don't have any shared prime factor. So, 4 # 3 = 0.

Now, compute 0 + 2. The answer is 2. 

So, The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: First off, we evaluate the operation within the parentheses in the first part of the expression: 

6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3 becomes 6@18 + 12-2  #  3

Next, we perform the concatenation operation (C), based on the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC):

That turns the expression into 618 + 12-2  #  3 

We then perform the addition and subtraction operations (A/S). They work from left to right:

This simplifies the expression to  630 - 2  #  3 

Again, we perform subtraction:

That gives: 628  #  3

Last but not least, we perform the prime factor counting operation (F). As a reminder, this operation counts the number of unique prime factors shared by absolute values of 628 and 3.

The prime factors of 628 are 2 and 157. And the only prime factor of 3 is 3. Hence, there are no shared prime factors.

So, 628 # 3 = 0 

Final answer is ""The answer is 0."""
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: First, according to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to execute the Prime Factor Counting operation (F), which is the 3#2 part. 

The prime factors of absolute value of 3 are {3}, and the prime factors of absolute value of 2 are {2}. No prime factors are shared so, 3#2 equals to 0.

Therefore, our equation simplifies to:
5 + 0

Next, we execute the addition (A)

5 + 0 = 5

So, our final result is 5.

The answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Given the mathematical expression 5+2 @ 4, and the new order of operations PEFMDASC, it's now clear how to solve this problem. 

According to the order we should first handle the Addition operation before the Concatenation operation:

When you add 5 + 2, it equals to 7.

Then, performing the Concatenation operation as 7 @ 4 = 74.

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem under the newly updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we follow the steps:

1. Evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F). Here 8#2 means the common unique prime factors 8 and 2 share. 8 is 2's multiple (2,4,8) and 2 itself is a prime number. Therefore, there is 1 common unique prime factor (2).
   Similarly, 6#6 means the common unique prime factors 6 and 6 share. For number 6, there are prime factors 2 and 3, therefore it has 2 unique prime factors.
   
   8#2 + 6#6 = 1 + 2.

2. Perform Addition (A).

   1 + 2 = 3.

Therefore, The answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: Given the mathematical operation:

4 # 3 + 2

According to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), Prime Factor Counting comes before Addition. So we first perform the Prime Factor Counting operation.

The Prime Factors of 4 are 2, and the Prime Factors of 3 are 3. Between 4 and 3, they don't have any prime factors in common.

Therefore, 4 # 3 = 0

Now, replace 4 # 3 in the given operation with 0

0 + 2 = 2

Therefore, 

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: Here's how we can solve this problem:

1. Solve the operations inside the parentheses first:
   6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3
   = 6@18 + 12-2  #  3

2. Apply Prime Factor Counting operation (F): 
   = 6@18 + 12-2  #  3 
   = 6@18 + 12-1  (As 2 and 3 share only 1 prime factor) 

3. According to the new rules, addition and subtraction are performed next (from left to right):
   = 6@18 + 11
   = 17@18 

4. Concatenation is the last step:
   = 1718

Hence, the answer is 1718."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: Given the mathematical operation:

5 + 3#2

First, you need to perform the prime factorization operation as F comes before A in the PEFMDASC sequence.
The prime factors of 3 are 3 itself, since 3 is a prime number. The prime factors of 2 are also 2, since 2 is the smallest prime number. Since there is no shared prime factor between 3 and 2, the operation 3#2 equates to 0.

So, the operation simplifies to:

5 + 0

Which then equates to 5 because the addition of 0 does not change a number.
So, 5 + 3#2 = 5

The answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: The given expression is 5 + 2 @ 4. 

Using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we should first perform any operations inside parentheses, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication and division from left to right, then addition and subtraction from left to right, and finally, the new operation, concatenation from left to right. In the given expression, there are no parentheses, exponents or prime factor counting. 

Using the order of operations, we must first perform the addition operation:
5 + 2 = 7 

Our expression is now 7 @ 4. 

Lastly, we perform the new operation, concatenation: 
7 @ 4 is the combination of the numbers 7 and 4, giving us 74.

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: According to the revised PEMDAS order now known as PEFMDASC:

First, find the prime factor counts 8#2 and 6#6.

Prime factors of 8: 2
Prime factors of 2: 2 
Since 2 is a shared prime factor among 8 and 2, the result of 8#2 = 1.

Prime factors of 6: 2 and 3
Prime factors of 6: 2 and 3
The prime factors for both are the same, therefore all are shared. Hence, the result of 6#6 = 2.

So, the revised expression becomes 1 + 2.

Finally, add the two resulting numbers 1+2, which equals 3.

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: The given operation is 4 # 3 + 2. 

Using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we should first perform any prime factor counting operations (#).

Prime Factor Counting (F): 4 # 3 = 0 
(Because, prime factor of |4| = 2 and prime factor of |3| = 3, and there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3.)

So, the equation now becomes 0 + 2. 

The next step according to PEFMDASC is to perform any addition or subtraction (A/S).

Addition (A): 0 + 2 = 2.

Therefore, the answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: Given expression is:

  6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Since parentheses are first, evaluate the term within the parentheses:

  = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we handle the prime factor counting operation:

  The unique prime factors of 2 is {2} and the unique prime factors of 3 is {3}. Since these are different,  2 # 3 = 0.

  = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Now we can perform the additions:

  = 6 @ 18 + 12

  = 6 @ 30

Finally, we perform the concatenation operation:

  = 630

Therefore, the calculated value of the expression is 630.

The answer is 630."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: The given expression is 5 + 3#2. Using the PEFMDASC order of operations, let's calculate it:

First, we need to apply the operation of Prime Factor counting (#).

Prime factors of 3: 3
Prime factors of 2: 2

Now, we'll compare the prime factors of 3 and 2. Since there are no common prime factors, 3#2 = 0.

So, the expression 5 + 3#2 equals 5 + 0. 

Next, perform the addition operation. Thus, 5 + 0 equals 5.

The answer is 5."
