Since there are no parentheses, exponents, or prime factor counting involved in this problem, we will move straight to addition and then concatenation.

The addition comes before the concatenation in the order of operations, so we first add 5 and 2:

5 + 2 = 7

7 @ 4 = 74

Step 1: Find the prime factors of the numbers and determine their shared unique prime factors.

For 8 and 2:
- The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (since 8 = 2^3).
- The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
The two numbers share one unique prime factor, which is 2.

For 6 and 6:
- The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 (since 6 = 2 * 3).
- The prime factors of 6 are, of course, the same: 2 and 3.
The two numbers share two unique prime factors, which are 2 and 3.

Step 2: Evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operation (#).

8#2 = 1 (as there is one shared prime factor: 2)
6#6 = 2 (as there are two shared prime factors: 2 and 3)

Step 3: Add the results of the prime factor counting operations.

1. Parentheses (P): we evaluate any expressions inside parentheses first.
\(14 + 4 = 18\)

So our expression becomes: 
\(6@18 + 12-2 # 3\)

2. Exponents (E): there are no exponents to evaluate in this expression.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F): we evaluate the prime factorization counting next.
For \(2 # 3\), each number's prime factors are:
- 2 has prime factors: 2
- 3 has prime factors: 3

Since there are no shared prime factors:
\(2 # 3 = 0\)

Now our expression looks like:
\(6@18 + 12-0\)

4. Multiplication (M) and Division (D): there is no multiplication or division to be done next.

5. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S): there is addition and subtraction in our expression.
We read the operation from left to right.

Addition first:
\(12 - 0 = 12\)

Now we concatenate:
\(6 @ 18 = 618\)

Our expression is now:
\(618 + 12\)

We then add the two numbers to get:
\(618 + 12 = 630\)

6. Concatenation (C): All concatenations have been resolved.

Hence, the final answer to the expression is:
The answer is 630."

                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.

                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)

                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

   - Prime factors of 8 are 2, because \(8 = 2^3\) and thus it only contains the prime factor 2.
   - Prime factors of 2 are just 2, because 2 is a prime number itself.
   So, for 8#2: both numbers share the prime factor 2, which is only one prime factor. Therefore, 8#2 = 1.

   - Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, because \(6 = 2 \cdot 3\).
   - For 6#6, we are essentially counting the unique prime factors that both instances of the number 6 share. Since it's the same number, it's clear they share the same prime factors.
   So, for 6#6: both instances have the shared prime factors 2 and 3. However, this only counts as two unique prime factors in total, so 6#6 = 2.

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): We first identify the number of unique prime factors shared by 4 and 3. 

The prime factors of 4 are 2 (since 4 is 2^2), and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since there are no shared prime factors, therefore:

Here's the given expression:

6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3

Let's proceed step by step:

1. Calculating anything inside parentheses first:
(14+4) = 18

The expression becomes:
6@18 + 12-2 # 3

2. Next, we look for exponents, but there are none. 

3. Now we need to perform the Prime Factor counting (F) operation:
2 # 3 = 0 (since 2's prime factors are just 2, and 3's prime factors are just 3, they share no common prime factors)

The expression becomes:
6@18 + 12-0

4. There are no Multiplication or Division operations to carry out, so we move to Addition and Subtraction (A/S).

We perform the operations from left to right as they appear:
12 - 0 = 12

The expression now is:
6@18 + 12

5. Now we tackle the Concatenation (C) operation last:
6@18 = 618 (the digits of 6 and 18 are concatenated)

Now the expression is:
618 + 12

6. Finally, we add the remaining numbers:
618 + 12 = 630

Putting it all together:

The answer is 630."

6. Concatenation (C): There is a concatenation (2 @ 4).

The operation to perform first is the addition due to the updated rules, so we add 5 and 2 to get 7. Concatenation should be performed last, so after the addition, we then concatenate 7 and 4:

5 + 2 @ 4

For this problem, we only need to consider Prime Factor Counting (F) and Addition (A), as there are no parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, subtraction, or concatenation involved.

First, we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation:

1. 8#2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2, while the prime factors of 2 are just 2. Since 2 is the common prime factor, they share exactly 1 unique prime factor. Thus, 8#2 equals 1.

2. 6#6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since both numbers are 6, they share the same prime factors of 2 and 3. However, keep in mind that we are only counting unique prime factors, so regardless of the count of the shared factors, 6#6 equals 2 (since there are two unique prime factors, 2 and 3).

With these evaluations, the problem becomes:

8#2 + 6#6 = 1 + 2

Now we just need to add these two values together:

1 + 2 = 3

Therefore, the final answer is ""The answer is 3."""

Given expression: 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)

First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses.

14 + 4 = 18

Now the expression looks like:

6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents (E)

There are no exponents in the expression to evaluate.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)

Now, we calculate prime factor counting for 2 # 3.

Since 2's prime factor is 2 and 3's prime factor is 3, they don't share any prime factors.

Therefore, 2 # 3 = 0

The expression now is:

6@18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)

There are no multiplication or division operations to perform.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)

We solve the addition and subtraction from left to right.

Before we add, we must perform the subtraction because it comes first from left to right:

12 - 0 = 12

Now the expression is:

6@18 + 12

Step 6: Concatenation (C)

Lastly, we perform the concatenation operation, merging the digits of 6 and 18.

6 @ 18 = 618

And we add the remaining number:

618 + 12 = 630

The answer is 630."

                    New Operations Introduced:

                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a@b, this operation merges the digits of |a| and |b|. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a@b = |a|@|b| = |12|@|-56| = 12@56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a@b = 0@24 = 024 = 24.
                    Please make sure you understand this properly; it's simple yet fundamental.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted as a#b, it counts the unique prime factors common to |a| and |b|. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.
                    It's crucial to get this right for accurate calculations.

                    Your ability to adapt to these changes is vital.

5 + 3#2

According to the updated order of operations, we need to evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F) before we perform Addition (A). 

First, we'll calculate the prime factors of the absolute values of the numbers and then count the unique prime factors they share:

- Prime factors of |3|: 3
- Prime factors of |2|: 2

Since there are no prime factors common to both 3 and 2, 3#2 will be equal to:

3#2 = 0

Now we'll add the result from the prime factor counting to 5:

5 + 0 = 5

Thus, the answer to 5 + 3#2, following the updated order of operations, is 5.

The answer is 5."

   - 6#6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since both numbers we are comparing are the same, they share the same prime factors. So, here, we have 2 shared prime factors (2 and 3), but remember, we're looking for the count of unique prime factors, so the result is 2.

Given expression: 6@(14+4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
First, we need to calculate the expression within the parentheses:

14 + 4 = 18

Now the expression becomes:
6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents in this expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we perform the prime factor counting between 2 and 3:

The prime factors of 2 are just 2 because it is a prime number.
The prime factors of 3 are just 3 because it is also a prime number.

Since there are no common prime factors between 2 and 3, 2 # 3 equals 0.

The expression now becomes:
6@18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
There are no multiplication or division operations to perform in our current expression.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
We now perform addition and subtraction from left to right:

12 - 0 = 12

The expression now becomes:
6@18 + 12

Now we add 6@18 and 12:
Before adding, we need to deal with concatenation which is the next step.
 
Step 6: Concatenation (C)
Now we perform the concatenation of 6 and 18:

6@18 = 618

The expression simplifies to:
618 + 12

We add them up:
618 + 12 = 630

So, the final answer to the expression after applying the updated order of operations is:
The answer is 630."
