Step 1: Evaluate what is inside the parentheses.
Inside the parentheses, we have 14 + 4 which equals 18. So, the expression becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Evaluate the concatenation operation (@) from left to right.
Since the left operand is 6 and the right operand is 18, we concatenate them to get 618.
So, the expression becomes:
618 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 3: Evaluate the prime factor counting operation (#) from left to right.
Since the left operand is 2 and the right operand is 3, they don't have any shared prime factors. So, the result is 0.
So, the expression becomes:
618 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Evaluate addition and subtraction operations from left to right.
6, 18, and 12 are added together to get 36. Then, subtract 0 from 36.
