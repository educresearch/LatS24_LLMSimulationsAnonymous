In the expression 5 + 2@4, we do not have any parentheses, exponents, or prime factor counting operations to perform. We also do not have multiplication, division, or subtraction present. So we start with addition and end with concatenation:

1. Perform the addition: 5 + 2 = 7
2. Proceed with concatenation: 7 @ 4

The concatenation of 7 and 4 is simply placing the digits next to each other, resulting in 74.

The answer is 74."

   8 # 2 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor is 2)

   - For 6 # 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since we are looking at the same number (6 # 6), it shares all of its prime factors with itself.
   6 # 6 = 2 (since the shared unique prime factors are both 2 and 3)

4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R): There are no multiplication or division operations to evaluate.
5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R): We now perform the addition with the results of the prime factor counting.

Prime factors of 3 are 3.

Since there are no prime factors in common, 4#3 evaluates to 0.

systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: First, we apply the order of operations, which, according to the new convention, is PEFMDASC:

1. Parentheses (P)
2. Exponents (E)
3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
4. Multiplication (M) and Division (D) (left to right)
5. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S) (left to right)
6. Concatenation (C) (left to right)

Let's break down the given expression step by step:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2#3

Step 1: Evaluate Parentheses (P)
Calculate the operation within the parentheses first.

14 + 4 = 18 

Now our expression looks like this:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents, so we can skip this step.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we apply the prime factor counting operation.

The prime factors of 2 are simply 2, and for 3, it is 3. Since they do not share any prime factors, the result is 0.

2#3 = 0

Our expression is now:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication (M) and Division (D)
No multiplication or division operations need to be done, so we can skip this step.

Step 5: Addition (A) and Subtraction (S)
We perform addition and subtraction from left to right.

While there is an addition operation 12 - 0 following the concatenation, it's important to notice that according to the new operation convention, the concatenation operation (C) comes after addition (A) and subtraction (S), even if it appears first when read left to right. Since addition and subtraction come before concatenation, we first have to calculate 12 -"
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

- The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or 2^3).
- The prime factors of 2 is just 2.
Since both numbers share the prime factor 2, the operation 8 # 2 results in 1 because there's only one unique prime factor shared between them.

- The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
- The prime factors of the other 6 are also 2 and 3.
Since both numbers share the prime factors 2 and 3, 6 # 6 results in 2 because there are two unique prime factors shared between them.

Let's solve it using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC.

Firstly, we perform any prime factor counting (F):

4#3 = The number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 4 and 3. The prime factors of 4 are 2 (since \( 4 = 2^2 \)), and the prime factor of 3 is 3 itself. As there are no shared prime factors, this results in:

4#3 = 0

Next, we perform addition (A):

0 + 2 = 2

There are no other operations to perform, so this is the final answer.

The answer is 2."

Given problem: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

We proceed as follows:

1. Parentheses (P): Evaluate expressions within parentheses first.
   6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
   = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Prime Factor Counting (F): Next, we evaluate the prime factor counting.
   Note: There's a mistake in the key examples provided for the prime factor counting operation. The example stating ""since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5"" should say ""since the only prime factor of 16 is 2, and the only prime factor of 4 is 2"".
   In our case:
   6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3
   Since the prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3, there are no shared prime factors. Hence, 2 # 3 = 0.
   = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

3. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There is no multiplication or division to be done next.

4. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Perform addition and subtraction from left to right.
   6 @ 18 + 12 - 0
   Since there is no subtraction or addition directly involved with the concatenation, we move from left to right.
   = 6 @ 18 + 12
   = 6 @ (18 + 12)
   = 6 @ 30
   (Note: we can combine the addition since the result of 18 + 12 will not be affected by being added before or after the concatenation due to the nature of this"

Given expression: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

First, we need to perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation before any addition (A).

1. Prime Factor Counting (F) between 8 and 2:
   The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2, and the prime factor for 2 is 2 itself.
   The shared prime factor is 2.
   Therefore, 8 # 2 equals 1, because there is only one unique prime factor that they share.

2. Prime Factor Counting (F) between 6 and 6:
   The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since we are comparing the same number, the set of unique prime factors will be the same and includes both 2 and 3.
   Therefore, 6 # 6 equals 2, because there are two unique prime factors that they share (2 and 3).

Now our expression looks like this: 1 + 2

3. Addition (A):
   1 + 2 = 3

Putting it all together, we get the final answer:

Here's the process:

5 + 3 # 2

First, let's find the result of the prime factor counting operation (3 # 2):

- The prime factors of |3| are 3.
- The prime factors of |2| are 2.
- There are no prime factors in common between 3 and 2, so 3 # 2 equals 0.

Now, we can replace the prime factor counting result into the original expression:

5 + (3 # 2) = 5 + 0

1. First, we identify the parts of the expression that include the new operations Prime Factor Counting (F) and Concatenation (C). Since there is no Concatenation (C) in the expression, we only need to focus on Prime Factor Counting (F). According to PEFMDASC, Prime Factor Counting (F) comes before Addition (A) and Subtraction (S).

2. Evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) for 8 # 2:
   The prime factor of 8 is 2 (2 * 2 * 2), and the prime factor of 2 is 2. The count of unique shared prime factors is 1 (since 2 is the only prime factor and it is shared).

   So, 8 # 2 = 1

3. Evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) for 6 # 6:
   The prime factor of 6 is 2 and 3. Since both values are 6, they share the same prime factors: 2 and 3. The count of unique shared prime factors is 2.

   So, 6 # 6 = 2

4. Now we substitute the results back into our original expression:

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
First, we need to perform the prime factor counting operation, which is represented by #. So we evaluate 4#3.

- 4 has prime factors: 2 and 2 (since 4 = 2 × 2).
- 3 has the prime factor: 3 (since 3 is a prime number).
- There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so their prime factor counting is 0.

This gives us:
4#3 = 0

Step 2: Addition (A)
Now we only have the addition left, so we add the result from Step 1 to 2.

0 + 2 = 2

Putting it all together, we have completed the required operations, and the answer is 2."

2. Exponents (E): There are no exponents in the expression.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F): Find the number of shared unique prime factors between the absolute values of two numbers.
   2#3 = 0 (since 2 has prime factor 2, and 3 has prime factor 3, there are no shared prime factors)
