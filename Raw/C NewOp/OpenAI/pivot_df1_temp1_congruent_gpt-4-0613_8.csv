gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Firstly, remember the order of operations: Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), Concatenation (from left to right) or PEFMDASC.

The given expression is:
5+2 @ 4

Applying the order of operations:
(i) Addition comes before Concatenation in order, thus, we need to perform 5+2 first.
(ii) 5+2 = 7.
(iii) After addition, the updated expression is 7 @ 4.
(iv) Performing the concatenation operation, 7 @ 4 = 74.

As the only operation was addition and concatenation in this case, the answer was determined straightforwardly following the updated order of operation.

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: Here's how to solve the given mathematics problem using the new convention PEFMDASC.

Given:
8#2 + 6#6

Firstly, we have to evaluate the prime factor counting operations due to PEFMDASC.
8#2 = 1 (since the shared prime factor between |8| (2) and |2| (2) is 2 )
6#6 = 1 (since 6 has only one prime factor, that's 2, shared with itself)

So, the given problem reduces to: 
1 + 1

Following standard and new order of operations, now we perform addition:

1 + 1 = 2

Hence, the final answer to the problem is 2. So, we can say:

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: Firstly, we perform the prime factor counting operation (4 # 3). The prime factors of 4 are 2, and those of 3 are 3. These two numbers do not share any prime factors. Therefore, 4 # 3 equals 0.

So, the equation now becomes 0 + 2.

Now, we perform the addition. 0+2 = 2.

So, the final answer is 2.

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: According to PEFMDASC, we proceed as follows:

= 6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 # 3 
= 618 + 12 - 2 # 3 
= 618 + 12 - 0 (since there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3)
= 630

So, the answer is 630."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: Firstly, we perform the prime factor counting operation (F) which is third in the new order of operations after parentheses and exponents.
2 has only one prime factor, which is 2 itself and 3 has only one prime factor, which is 3 itself. Therefore, 3#2 equals 0 because the prime factors of 3 and 2 are not the same.

Then, we perform the addition operation (A), which is before concatenation in the new order of operations, i.e., 5 + 0.

The answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), the first operation to execute would be addition.

So, the problem becomes:

5 + 2 @ 4 = 7 @ 4 (as 5 + 2 = 7)

Then, we will execute the next operation that is concatenation.

So, the problem becomes:

7 @ 4 = 74

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: First, we need to perform the Prime Factor Counting operation (F):

For 8#2, the prime factor of 8 is 2 and the prime factor of 2 is also 2. 
So, by comparing and counting the unique common prime factors, we get 8#2 = 1.

For 6#6, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since we compare the prime factors of same number (6), we need to count all the unique prime factors. 
So, we get 6#6 = 2. 

Substituting the results of Prime Factor Counting operation (F) we get:
1 + 2

Finally, we perform the addition operation to get the final answer. 
So, 1 + 2 = 3

Thus, the answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: Firstly, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation, which is 4 # 3. Both 4 and 3 are prime numbers but they are different so they have no shared prime factors. Therefore, the result is 0 by definition.

So, we now have the expression: 0 + 2.

Finally, we perform the addition operation, resulting in 2.

So, the correct solution to this operation is:

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: To solve 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3, you first evaluate the expression within the parentheses. Then you perform the prime factor counting operation, followed by the addition and then subtraction operations, and finally you complete the concatenation operation. 

Here is the evaluation in the correct order: 

6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3 = 6 @ (18) + 12-2 # 3 (parentheses is first according to PEFMDASC)
= 6 @ 18 + 12-2 # 3 (evaluated the parentheses)
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (evaluated prime factor counting, 2 is the only prime factor shared by both 2 and 3)
= 6 @ 18 + 11 (evaluated addition before concatenation)
= 618 + 11 (concatenation is done)
= 629.

Hence, the answer to the expression 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3 is 629 according to the PEFMDASC order of operations. Therefore, 

""The answer is 629."""
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: Firstly, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation, which will be done before addition according to the updated order of operations - PEFMDASC. 

The prime factors of 3 are [3], and the prime factors of 2 are [2]. They do not share any prime factors, so 3 # 2 = 0.

The answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Based on the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to perform operations in the following steps:

5 + 2 @ 4 

= 5 + 24 (since concatenation comes after addition in the order of operations, 2 @ 4 = 24)

= 29 (addition, 5 + 24 = 29)

Therefore, 

The answer is 29."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we will apply the new mathematical operations and the updated order of operations PEFMDASC.

The problem is 8#2 + 6#6. 

According to Prime Factor Counting (F):
- 8 and 2 both have the prime factor 2, so 8#2 = 1.
- 6 has the prime factors 2 and 3. As 6 and 6 are the same number, they have the exact same prime factors. So 6#6 = 2.

Substituting these values into the given expression, the problem becomes 1 + 2. 

To solve it, we need to follow the PEFMDASC order of operations. As per the order, the operation to be done here involve addition:

1 + 2 = 3

Start-off Expression: 5 + 2 @ 4

Step 1 - Parentheses (P): There are no parentheses, so we move on to the next step.

Step 2 - Exponents (E): Again, no exponents in the expression, so we proceed to the next step.

Step 3 - Prime Factor Counting (F): There are also no prime factor counts to perform, so we skip to the next step.

Step 4 - Multiplication or Division (M/D): No multiplication or division operations are present in the expression, so let's move to the next step.

Step 5 - Addition or Subtraction (A/S): Yes, there is an addition operation. We perform the addition operation before concatenation due to the revised order of operations.
So, our operation becomes: 5 + 2 = 7.
                                              
Updated expression: 7 @ 4

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: In this problem, we have to calculate the expression 8#2 + 6#6. According to our new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we do Prime Factor Counting (F) before Addition (A). So, let's first calculate the prime factor counts.

To calculate 8#2:
The prime factors of |8| (which is 8 itself) are 2 (2*2*2) and the prime factor of |2| (which is 2 itself) is also 2. Since 2 is the only prime factor common between 8 and 2, the count is 1. So, 8#2 = 1.

To calculate 6#6:
The prime numbers in |6| (which is 6 itself) are 2 and 3. Since the numbers are same in this operation, all the prime factors are shared. So the count is 2. Hence, 6#6 = 2.

Accordingly, the given expression 8#2 + 6#6 becomes 1 + 2.

Finally, the addition of 1 + 2 equals to 3.

The answer is 3."

Step 2: Exponents. There are no exponents in this expression, so we skip to the next step.

Step 3: Prime Factor counting (F)
We perform 4 # 3 and get the count of unique prime factors shared between 4 and 3. The prime factors of 4 are 2 (2 twice) and of 3 is 3. They do not share any prime factors, so 4 # 3 equals 0. The expression becomes:
0 + 2

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D). There is no multiplication or division in this expression, so we skip to the next step.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S). 
We perform 0 + 2 to get 2. 

Step 6: Concatenation. There is no concatenation operation in this expression, so there is nothing to do in this step.

To solve this expression, we must follow the PEFMDASC order of operations. The steps include solving for Parentheses, Exponents, prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right, and finally Concatenation from left to right.

Step 1 - Parentheses:
First, we solve the operation within parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18
So, the expression becomes: 6@18 + 12-2  # 3

Step 2 - Prime Factor Counting (F):
Next, we compute the prime factor counting for 12-2 and 3: 
As 2 has only one prime number 2 and 3 has only one prime number 3, there are no shared prime factors between them. So, the result is 0. 
So, our expression simplifies to: 6@18 + 0

Step 3 - Addition/Subtraction (A/S):
We perform addition or subtraction from left to right. In our case, we have the addition operation: 6@18 + 0 = 6@18
So, the expression becomes: 6@18

Step 4 - Concatenation (C):
Finally, we perform the concatenation: 6 @ 18 = 618.

So, the final answer to the given expression 6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3 using the order  PEFMDASC is 618.

Step 1: Parentheses. There are no parentheses, so there is nothing to do in this step.

Step 2: Exponents. There are no exponents in this expression, so we skip to the next step.

Step 3: Prime Factor counting (F)
We perform 3#2. To perform prime factor counting, we list the prime factors of each number.
The prime factor for 3 is 3 and prime factor for 2 is 2. So, there are no common prime factors between 3 and 2. Therefore, 3#2 = 0.

The expression now is:
5 + 0

Step 4: Multiplication and Division. There are no multiplication or division operations in this expression, so we skip to the next step.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S). Now we perform the addition.
5 + 0 is 5.
