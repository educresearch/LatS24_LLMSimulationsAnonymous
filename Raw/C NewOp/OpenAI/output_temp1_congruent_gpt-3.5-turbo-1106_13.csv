First, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we move on to the next step.

Next, we evaluate the concatenation operation (@) before addition. Therefore, we need to find the value of 2 @ 4 first.

Using the concatenation operation, 2 @ 4 = 24.

Now that we have the result of the concatenation, we can perform the addition. So, 5 + 24 = 29.

1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first:
   14 + 4 = 18

2. Next, perform the concatenation operation:
   6 @ 18 = 618

3. Now, evaluate the prime factor counting operation:
   12 - 2 # 3
   First, calculate the count of shared prime factors between 12 and 2:
   The prime factorization of 12 is 2^2 * 3^1, and the prime factorization of 2 is 2^1.
   The only shared prime factor is 2.
   So, 12 - 2 # 3 = 12 - 1 = 11

                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

First, let's evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation. 
- 8 has the prime factors 2, 2, and 2 (or 2^3).
- 2 has the prime factor 2 (or 2^1).
- The common prime factor is 2.
So, 8 # 2 = 1 (since there is only 1 shared prime factor 2).

Next, let's continue with the prime factor counting (F) operation for the second part of the expression.
- 6 has the prime factors 2 and 3 (or 2^1 * 3^1).
- 6 also has the prime factors 2 and 3 (or 2^1 * 3^1).
- The common prime factors are 2 and 3.
So, 6 # 6 = 2 (since there are 2 shared prime factors).

Now, we can perform the addition (A/S) operation.
8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 2 = 3.

Therefore, the final answer is 3."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)

Given expression: 5 + 2 @ 4

1. We start by identifying that there are no parentheses or exponents in the expression, so we move on to evaluating the prime factor counting (F).
   
2. Prime factor counting: 2 # 4
   The prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 4 are 2, 2. 
   There is 1 shared prime factor (2).
   Therefore, 2 # 4 = 1.

3. Next, we perform addition between the remaining numbers. 
   
4. Addition: 5 + 1
   This gives us 6.

5. Lastly, we carry out the concatenation operation.

Given Expression: 4 # 3 + 2

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting
We start by calculating the prime factor count between 4 and 3. Since 4 has a prime factor of 2 and 3 has a prime factor of 3, they do not share any prime factors. So, 4 # 3 = 0.

Step 2: Addition
Now, we perform addition, which gives us: 0 + 2 = 2.

So, the final answer is 2."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

First, let's start with the given expression step by step.

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
12 # 3
Prime factors of 12 are 2 and 3; prime factors of 3 are 3. There is 1 shared prime factor (3).
So, 12 # 3 = 1.

Step 2: Parentheses (P)
6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2 
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 
Since we have resolved the parentheses, we move to the next step.

Step 3: Concatenation (C)
6 @ 18 = 618

Step 4: Addition (A)
618 + 12 = 630

Step 5: Subtraction (S)
630 - 2 = 628
