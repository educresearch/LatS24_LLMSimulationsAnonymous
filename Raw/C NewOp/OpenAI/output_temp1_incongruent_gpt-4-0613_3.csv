We start by simplifying what's inside the parentheses, followed by the prime factor counting operation and the subtraction.

6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3 
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3 (simplify inside parentheses 14+4 = 18)
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 (since prime factor of 3 are [3], and prime factor of 2 are [2]. Hence there are no shared prime factor, i.e., 2#3 = 0)
= 618 + 12 - 0
= 630 - 0 (using addition before subtraction)
= 630 (since 630 - 0 = 630)

Hence the final answer to the problem within the context of new operations and order of operations is 630.

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

systemPrompt3_userPrompt2_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we will use the PEFMDASC order of operations, where P stands for Parentheses, E for Exponents, F for Prime Factor Counting, M/D for Multiplication and Division from left to right, A/S for Addition and Subtraction from left to right, and C for Concatenation.

So, the order of operations would begin with Prime Factor Counting (F), then Addition (A).

Here are the steps:

Step 1: Evaluate 8 # 2
The prime factors of 8 are 2 (2*2*2), and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since they share one prime factor (2), 8 # 2 = 1.

Step 2: Evaluate 6 # 6
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since they share two prime factors (2 and 3), 6 # 6 = 2.

Step 3: Add the results
Now, add the results of these operations (1+2), which equals to 3.

So, 8 # 2+6 # 6 = 3.

The answer is 3."

Afterwards, we count the shared unique prime factors between 2 and 3 using the F operation. Given that 2 is prime and 3 is also prime, there is no shared prime factor, so 2#3 equals 0.

So now, the expression is: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Given our Order of Operations (PEFMDASC), we solve Prime Factor Counting (F) before Addition (A):

Starting with 3 # 2, 3 and 2 are both primes and thus, they do not share any common factor. Hence, 3 # 2 = 0

The expression now becomes: 5 + 0
Performing the addition, we get 5 + 0 = 5

So, the answer is 5."

                    New Operations:

                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the expression, we need to follow the PEFMDASC order of operations.

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
In our case: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
Let's solve parentheses:
14 + 4 = 18 

We then replace (14+4) in the expression with 18. The updated expression is now:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Let's calculate the prime factors in the expression: 2#3
The unique prime factors of |2| are 2
The unique prime factors of |3| are 3
They do not share any prime number.
So, 2 # 3 = 0 

We replace 2 # 3 in the expression with 0.
The expression becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Steps 3 & 4: Exponentiation, Multiplication, and Division (E, M/D)
There are no exponentiations, multiplications, or divisions in the new expression, so we proceed to the next step.

Step 5: Addition & Subtraction (A/S)
From left to right:
Firstly, let's perform addition 18 + 12 = 30

So the updated expression becomes:
6 @ 30 - 0

Now, let's perform the subtraction operation 30 - 0 = 30

So, the updated expression becomes:
6 @ 30

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
Now it's time for the Concatenation operation
6 @ 30 = 630

Let's replace 6 @ 30 in our expression with 630:
The answer is 630."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

We use the revised order of operations PEFMDASC, where the first step is Parentheses (P), but there aren't any parenthetical expressions in the given equation. 

The next step is Exponents (E), also not applicable here.

After that, we have Prime Factor Counting (F), which applies in our case.

So, we start with the expression 3 # 2. The prime factor of 3 is 3 itself and the prime factor of 2 is 2 itself. There are no shared unique prime factors between 3 and 2, so 3 # 2 equals 0.

Thus, our equation becomes: 5 + 0, keeping in mind the revised order of operations (PEFMDASC), next in line is Addition/Subtraction.

Performing the addition operation, we get: 5 + 0 = 5.

Therefore, The answer is 5."
