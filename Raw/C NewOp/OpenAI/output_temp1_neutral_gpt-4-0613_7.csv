systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parenthesis, i.e 14 + 4 = 18. So, the expression becomes:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Here, we need to remember that the order of operations is from left to right due to the newly updated order of operations. Our next operation therefore, is prime factor counting which comes before addition and comes before concatenation. So, we evaluate 2 # 3 = 1 (since they share only one prime factor, i.e., 2). So the expression becomes:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

Next, we proceed from left to right, remember we've to follow the order of operations PEFMDASC. The next operation is concatenation which comes before addition, this results in:

618 + 12 - 1

Continue with the order of operations PEFMDASC, we see that addition comes before subtraction. Thus, 618 + 12 = 630. The expression becomes:

630 - 1

And at last, subtraction which will result in:

629

Therefore, the final answer is 629. So,

The answer is 629."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

systemPrompt3_userPrompt2_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To understand how to solve this problem, we apply the new order of operations, PEFMDASC.

First, we solve for # operation, since it falls under Prime Factor Counting:

8 # 2 counts the number of common unique prime factors between 8 and 2.
Prime factors of 8 are 2, and prime factors of 2 are 2. They both share one common prime factor which is 2.
So, 8 # 2 = 1

Next, we solve 6 # 6.
Here, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since we are comparing the same number, it has the same prime factors. So, these will share two common prime factors (2 and 3).
So, 6 # 6 = 2

The equation simplifies to: 
1 + 2 

Solving the addition, give us: 1 + 2 = 3 

The answer is 3."

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Then, we use the order of operations to do the prime factor counting operation (F) which comes after parentheses and exponents (we don't have any exponents to simplify in this problem).

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 
Also note, the prime factors of |2| are 2, and there are no prime factors of 3. That’s why 2 # 3 = 0.

Next in the order is multiplication or division, but we don't have any of those operations here. So, we move on to addition, which comes before the new concatenation operation.

So let's do that:

(a) Prime Factor Counting (F): We have a = 3 and b = 2.
The prime factor of 3 is 3, and the prime factor of 2 is 2. 
These are both unique prime factors, so they don't share any common prime factors.

Therefore, 3 # 2 = 0.

Then we are left with the equation: 5 + 0

(a) Addition (A): Here, we simply add 5 + 0, which equals 5. 

So, the final result of the given Mathematics problem ""5 + 3 # 2"" is 5.

The answer is 5."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:

                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1.

(i) Evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F): 
4 # 3 = 0
Because the prime factor of 4 is 2, and the prime factor of 3 is 3, they have no shared prime factors. 

Also, notice that we proceed from left to right, meaning we've evaluated 4 # 3 before considering the ""+ 2"".

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Here is the breakdown of the expression 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 according to the new order of operations PEFMDASC: 

Step 1: Handle Parentheses (P)
We start with evaluating the expression inside the parentheses:
14 + 4 = 18.
So, the new expression is 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Evaluate Exponents (E)
There are no exponents in the equation, so we can skip this step.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
The prime factor counting operation is performed between 2 and 3.
The Prime factors of 2 are {2}, and for 3 the factors are {3}.
There aren't any shared prime factors, so 2 # 3 = 0.
The updated equation is 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0.

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
There are no multiplication or division steps to perform in this equation.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Evaluate the addition and subtraction operations from left to right.
First, perform the addition operation: 18 + 12 = 30.
So, the new equation is 6 @ 30 - 0.
Then, perform the subtraction operation: 30 - 0 = 30.
So, the new equation is 6 @ 30.

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
Finally, perform the last operation, which is concatenation: 
6 @ 30 = 630.

The answer is 630."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

(i) Evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F): 
3 # 2 = 1
