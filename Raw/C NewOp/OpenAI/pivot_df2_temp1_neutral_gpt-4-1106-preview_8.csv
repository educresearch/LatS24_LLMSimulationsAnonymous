gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), let's break down the expression step by step:

4 # 3 + 2

We start by evaluating the prime factor counting (F), which comes before addition (A) in the order of operations:

4 # 3 

The unique prime factors of 4 are 2 (since 4 = 2^2), and the unique prime factors of 3 is 3. They do not share any common prime factors.

Therefore, 4 # 3 = 0 (since there are no shared prime factors)

Now, the expression simplifies to:

0 + 2

Finally, we perform the addition:

0 + 2 = 2

Thus, the final answer to the problem is 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Let's evaluate the expression step-by-step following the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

Given expression: 4 # 3 + 2

1. Prime Factor Counting (F) first:
The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (4 = 2 x 2).
The prime factors of 3 are just 3 (3 = 3 x 1).
These two numbers do not share any prime factors, so:
4 # 3 = 0

2. Addition (A) next:
Now we have: 0 + 2

3. Perform the addition:
0 + 2 = 2

Therefore, the final answer is 2, and the expression is written as ""The answer is 2.""","GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC. Here is the breakdown:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): The first operation we must perform is the prime factor counting between 4 and 3, denoted as 4 # 3. 
   - The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (or just 2 since we are interested in unique primes).
   - The prime factors of 3 are just 3.

Since there are no common prime factors between 4 and 3, the prime factor count is 0.

2. Addition: Now that we have solved the prime factor counting, we proceed with the addition.

So, the calculation changes as follows:

4 # 3 + 2
= 0 + 2
= 2

Therefore, applying the new operations and the order of operations, we conclude with the final answer:

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Let's apply the revised order of operations PEFMDASC to solve the expression \( 4 \# 3 + 2 \):

1. Parentheses (P): There are no parentheses to evaluate first.
2. Exponents (E): There are no exponents to evaluate.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We need to evaluate \( 4 \# 3 \). The prime factor for 4 is 2 and the prime factor for 3 is 3. Since there are no common prime factors between 4 and 3, the result is 0.
4. Multiplication/Division (M/D): There is no multiplication or division to evaluate.
5. Addition/Subtraction (A/S): We add the result of the prime factor counting to 2: \( 0 + 2 \).
6. Concatenation (C): There is no concatenation to evaluate.

So the expression reduces to:
\( 4 \# 3 + 2 \)
\( = 0 + 2 \)
\( = 2 \)

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), let's follow the steps correctly:

We have \[5 + 2 @ 4\]

The new order of operations requires us to handle Parentheses first (though there aren't any in this example), then Exponents (none here either), followed by Prime Factor Counting, Multiplication and Division (there are none of these), Addition and Subtraction, and finally Concatenation.

Since addition comes before concatenation in the order of operations and there are no other operations involved, we first add 5 and 2, then perform the concatenation with 4.

5 + 2 @ 4
= \(7 @ 4\) (Addition before concatenation)
= 74 (Concatenation of 7 and 4)

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: Let's follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC to evaluate the given expression: \(5 + 2 @ 4\).

First, according to the order, we have to perform any operations inside parentheses, but there are no parentheses here.

Next, we'd handle any exponents, which are also not present in this expression.

Then we'd calculate any instances of prime factor counting (F), but the expression doesn’t contain any # operator.

Following this is multiplication or division (M/D), again not applicable in this case.

After that is addition or subtraction (A/S), which we do see here. However, according to our new rules, concatenation (C) should actually be evaluated after addition, contrary to the old conventions.

Finally, we evaluate concatenation (C): \(2 @ 4\). As per the definition above, concatenation involves combining the digits of the two numbers:

\(2 @ 4 = 24\)

Now we can proceed with the only addition operation left:

\(5 + 24 = 29\)

So, the final answer is \(29\).

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: To solve the given problem 5 + 2 @ 4 using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we must perform the concatenation after the addition, as concatenation (C) is the last operation in the order.

So, we break down the problem as follows:

5 + 2 @ 4

Start with the addition:

= 5 + 2
= 7

Now perform the concatenation with the result of the addition and the number 4:

7 @ 4
= 74

Therefore, the final answer is 74.

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: Let's apply the revised order of operations PEFMDASC to solve this expression:

5. Addition/Subtraction
6. Concatenation

The given expression is 5 + 2 @ 4. According to the updated order of operations, we must perform addition/subtraction before concatenation. So we first add 5 and 2.

\( 5 + 2 = 7 \)

Now we have:

7 @ 4

At this step, concatenation occurs because there is nothing else to evaluate. So we concatenate the digits of 7 and 4:

\( 7 @ 4 = 74 \)

1. (P) Parentheses 
2. (E) Exponents 
3. (F) Prime Factor counting
4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (from Left to Right)
5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (from Left to Right)
6. (C) Concatenation (from Left to Right)

Following these rules:
- There are no parentheses or exponents to deal with.
- Next, we handle the prime factor counting operation (#).

The prime factors of 3 are 3 only since 3 is a prime number, while the prime factors of 2 are 2 only since 2 is a prime number. There are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, so:
3 # 2 = 0

Now we have:
5 + (3 # 2) = 5 + 0

4. Multiplication (M) and Division (D): N/A
5. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S): Add the result of the prime factor counting to 5, which is \(5 + 0 = 5\).

3 # 2 means we are counting the unique prime factors common to 3 and 2.

- The prime factor of 3 is 3.
- The prime factor of 2 is 2.
- Since there are no common prime factors, 3 # 2 = 0.

Now we perform the addition with the result of the Prime Factor Counting:

There are no exponents to evaluate.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Before we add, we have to perform the prime factor counting operation, denoted by the symbol #.

Calculate 3 # 2:
The prime factors of 3 are just 3, and the prime factors of 2 are just 2. Since they share no common prime factors, the result of the prime factor counting is 0.

\(3 \# 2 = 0\)

Next, Prime Factor counting (F):
6 @ 18 + 12 - (2 and 3 share the prime factor 2, so there's 1)
6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

There are no Exponents (E), Multiplication (M), or Division (D) to perform next.

Now, perform Addition (A) and Subtraction (S):
6 @ 18 + 11
6 @ 29

Lastly, perform Concatenation (C):
6 @ 29 = 629

So the final answer is 629.

The answer is 629.","GPT Response: First, we evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:

14 + 4 = 18

Next, according to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we should evaluate the prime factor counting before doing addition, subtraction, or concatenation:

Both 2 and 3 are prime numbers with no shared prime factors.

2 # 3 = 0

Now we're left with:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

According to the updated order of operations, we perform the concatenation operation (C) before addition or subtraction:

6 @ 18

This is a concatenation of the digits of 6 and 18:

6 @ 18 = 618

Now we have:

618 + 12 - 0

We can perform addition and subtraction from left to right:

618 + 12 = 630

Following these steps for the given problem:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

First, we deal with the parentheses:
6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 # 3

Then, we involve prime factor counting, but note that it will come later in this case since there is no need to apply this operation right now.

Next, we would typically do multiplication and division, but there aren't any in this problem.

Then we do the addition and subtraction. However, here we notice that the addition cannot be done right now because it is involved with a concatenation operation which comes last.

We will next perform the prime factor counting operation:
- 2 # 3
The prime factors of 2 are just 2, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3. Since they don't share any common prime factors, this operation results in 0.

So the problem becomes:
6 @ (18) + 12 - 0

Finally, we perform the concatenation operation:
6 @ 18 = 618

Now we can continue with addition and subtraction, since concatenation has been completed:
618 + 12 - 0

Adding 12:
618 + 12 = 630

Subtracting 0, which won't change the result:
630 - 0 = 630

   So, the expression now becomes:
   6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Exponents (E): There are no exponents to evaluate in this expression.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F): Calculate the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values.
   Here, we have 2 # 3:
   The prime factors of 2 are just 2 itself, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3 itself. There are no shared prime factors.

For 8 # 2:
- The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (which is 2^3).
- The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
Since they share one unique prime factor, which is 2, the result is 1 for this part of the expression.

For 6 # 6:
- The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
- Since we're comparing 6 with itself, it shares all of its prime factors.
The prime factors shared are 2 and 3, which results in 2 because there are two unique prime factors shared.

1. We will first apply the Prime Factor Counting operation because it comes before addition in the order of operations.

The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (since \(8 = 2^3\)). The prime factor of 2 is 2. Since they share the prime factor 2, \(8 # 2\) is equal to 1 because there is one unique prime factor shared.

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 (since \(6 = 2 \times 3\)). Since the shared prime factor is 2 and 3, \(6 # 6\) is equal to 2 because there are two unique shared prime factors (2 and 3).

2. Now, we can replace the prime factors counting results in the expression:

\(8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 2\)

- Prime factors of 2 are 2.
- Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.

Now we use Prime Factor Counting (F):
- 8 # 2: Since 8 and 2 share the prime factor 2, this gives us a count of 1.
- 6 # 6: All the prime factors of 6 are shared with itself, but we only count unique prime factors. The unique prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. This would mean we have 2 unique prime factors in common.

- For 8 # 2: 
  The prime factors of 8 are 2 x 2 x 2 (or \(2^3\)).
  The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
