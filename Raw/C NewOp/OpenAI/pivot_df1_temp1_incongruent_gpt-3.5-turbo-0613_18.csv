Step 1: Evaluate Parentheses
There are no parentheses in the expression, so we can move on to the next step.

Step 2: Evaluate Exponents
There are no exponents in the expression, so we move on to the next step.

Step 3: Evaluate Prime Factor Counting
We have the expression 2#3, which means we need to count the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 2 and 3. Both 2 and 3 are prime numbers and they have no shared prime factors. So 2#3 = 0.

Step 4: Evaluate Multiplication and Division (left to right)
There are no multiplication or division operations in the expression, so we move on to the next step.

Step 5: Evaluate Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
We have the expression 14+4. Evaluating from left to right, we get 14+4 = 18.

Step 6: Evaluate Concatenation (left to right)
Now we have 6 @ (18) + 12 - 0. Since concatenation is the last operation to be performed, we can evaluate it.

6 @ 18 = 618 (concatenating the digits of 6 and 18)

So, the expression becomes 618 + 12 - 0.
