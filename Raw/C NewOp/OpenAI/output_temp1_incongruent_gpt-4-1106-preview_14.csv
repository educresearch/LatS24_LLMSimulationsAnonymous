The expression is 5 + 2 @ 4.

Although normally we would need to focus on parentheses, exponents, and prime factor counting before addressing addition and concatenation, in this particular expression, there are no parentheses, exponents, or prime factor counting operations to consider. We can proceed directly to addition and concatenation.

According to the new order of operations, addition (A) comes before concatenation (C). 

Therefore, we evaluate the addition first:

5 + 2 = 7.

Now, we apply the concatenation operation on the result and the remaining number:

7 @ 4.

Since the concatenation operation is to combine the digits of the numbers:

7 @ 4 = 74.

Thus, the final answer is:

The answer is 74."

The original expression is:
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

1. Parentheses (P):
First, we evaluate the expression within the parentheses (14 + 4):
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Prime Factor Counting (F):
Next, we perform the prime factor counting operation for 2 # 3:
The prime factors of 2 are {2}, and the prime factors of 3 are {3}. There are no shared prime factors, so 2 # 3 is 0.
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

3. Exponents (E):
There are no exponentiation operations in the expression.

4. Multiplication and Division (MD):
There are no multiplication or division operations to be performed at this step.

5. Addition and Subtraction (AS):
We can now perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right.
First, 18 + 12:
6 @ 30 - 0

Now subtraction:
30 - 0 = 30.

6. Concatenation (C):
Finally, we concatenate 6 with 30:
6 @ 30 = 630.

Now the entire expression has been evaluated and the final result is:
The answer is 630."

                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

Given:
8 # 2 + 6 # 6

We have two prime factor counting operations and an addition to perform.

Let's start with the prime factor counting operations:

8 # 2:
The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (2^3).
The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
They share a prime factor of 2, so the result of this operation is 1 (as they share only one prime factor, which is 2).

6 # 6:
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
The prime factors of 6 are the same, 2 and 3.
Since both numbers are the same, they obviously share the same prime factors. Therefore, the result is 2 (as there are two shared prime factors: 2 and 3).

Now we can perform the addition, with the results from above:

1 (from 8 # 2) + 2 (from 6 # 6) = 3

According to the new order:

2. Addition (A)

Firstly, we apply the Prime Factor Counting operation:

4 # 3 = 0 because there are no shared prime factors between the numbers 4 (whose prime factors are 2) and 3 (whose prime factor is 3 itself).

So now we have:

1. Evaluate the expression within the parentheses: (14+4)
   14 + 4 = 18

2. Now we have: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3
   Next, we evaluate the Prime Factor counting: 2#3
   The prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. There are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3.
   So, 2#3 = 0

3. The expression is now: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0
   Since there are no exponents to evaluate, we move on to the next steps.

4. Perform addition and subtraction next according to the PEFMDASC order.
   First, we perform the subtraction as there's no multiplication or division involved yet:
   12 - 0 = 12

5. Now we have: 6 @ 18 + 12
   We perform the addition:

6. Finally, we perform the concatenation: 6 @ 30

The original expression: 5 + 2@4

According to the new rules, we must perform addition before concatenation. So, let's go ahead with the addition first:

5 + 2 = 7

Next, we perform the concatenation with the result of the addition and the remaining number:

7@4 = 74 (since concatenation merges the digits of the two numbers)

Thus, the final answer is 74.

The answer is 74."

Firstly, evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F):

8 # 2
The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (2^3).
The prime factors of 2 are 2.
Since both numbers share the prime factor 2, the result of prime factor counting for 8 # 2 is 1 (as they only share a single prime factor).

Next, evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) for:

6 # 6
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
The prime factors of 6 are the same: 2 and 3.
Since both numbers share the prime factors 2 and 3, the result of prime factor counting for 6 # 6 is 2 (as they share two prime factors).

P - Parentheses:
We will first deal with any operations that are inside parentheses.

(14 + 4) = 18

Now the expression becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

E - Exponents:
There are no exponents in the expression, so we move on to the next step.

F - Prime Factor Counting:
We need to evaluate 2#3 for unique prime factors shared between 2 and 3.

Since 2 and 3 are both prime and unique, there are no shared prime factors. Hence, 2#3 is 0.

Now our expression is:

M/D - Multiplication and Division:
There is no multiplication or division to perform, so we move on.

A/S - Addition and Subtraction:
We need to perform the addition next.

Since subtraction has to be done from left to right, we have not yet performed the operation as we've done addition first. Now the expression is:

The original expression: 5 + 3 # 2

First, we will work on the Prime Factor Counting (F) part of the expression, ""3 # 2"".

The prime factors of 3 are just 3, and the prime factors of 2 are just 2. Since they do not share any common prime factors, the result of 3 # 2 is 0.

Replacing the result of Prime Factor Counting into the original expression:

5 + (3 # 2)
5 + 0

1. We do not have any parentheses, exponents, or prime factor counting to consider, so we move on to the next step in the order, which is addition or subtraction.
2. However, we cannot perform the addition yet because we see that there is a concatenation operation after it. Concatenation must be carried out before addition according to the PEFMDASC order.
3. Perform concatenation: 2@4
   Since concatenation joins the digits of |2| and |4| together, we get:

First, we evaluate the prime factor counting operations (8 # 2 and 6 # 6):

8 # 2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (2^3), and the prime factors of 2 is 2. Both numbers have a prime factor of 2 in common.
Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1 (since they share only one prime factor: 2)

6 # 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since both numbers are the same, they share all prime factors: 2 and 3.

First expression: 4 # 3
Prime Factor Counting (F) comes before addition (A) in PEFMDASC.

Step 1: Find the shared unique prime factors of 4 and 3.
- The prime factors of 4 are 2, 2 (or just 2 since we count unique prime factors).
- The prime factors of 3 is 3.
There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3.

Thus, 4 # 3 = 0.

Now the expression becomes: 0 + 2

The next operation is addition (A).

Step 2: Add 0 and 2.
0 + 2 = 2

The final answer is 2."

                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)

**Step 1: Parentheses (P)**
First, we evaluate the expression within the parentheses:

14 + 4 = 18

So now the expression becomes:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

**Step 2: Exponents (E)**
There are no exponents in our expression, so we move on to the next operation.

**Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)**
Next, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation:

The prime factors of 2 are {2}, and the prime factors of 3 are {3}. They do not share any prime factors, so:

2#3 = 0

Now the expression is:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

**Step 4: Multiplication/Division (M/D)**
There is no multiplication or division to be performed in our expression, so we move on to the next operation.

**Step 5: Addition/Subtraction (A/S)**
We will perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:

12 - 0 = 12

There's no addition that can be done yet because we still have to deal with concatenation. So we're left with:

6 @ 18 + 12

**Step 6: Concatenation (C)**
We now perform the concatenation operation from left to right. Concatenation takes the digits and joins them together:

6 @ 18 = 618
(Note that 6 and 18 are concatenated as whole numbers; signs do not affect this operation.)

Our expression is now:

618 + 12

**Step 7: Finishing Addition/Subtraction (A/S)**
Finally, we add the concatenated number to 12:

618 + 12 = 630

The answer is 630."
