First, we check for any parentheses, but there are none in this expression.

Next, we evaluate any exponents, but there are none in this expression.

Then, we move on to prime factor counting. There are no prime factor counting operations in this expression, so we skip this step.

After that, we perform any multiplications or divisions from left to right. Again, there are none in this expression.

Next, we perform any additions or subtractions from left to right. We have 5 + 2, which equals 7.

Finally, we perform the concatenation operation. We have 7 @ 4, which gives us 74.

Therefore, the answer is 74."

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

First, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation, which counts the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of a and b.

4 has one prime factor: 2.

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting
We start by performing prime factor counting on each pair of numbers in the expression.
8 # 2 = 1 (since 8 has prime factor 2 and 2 has prime factor 2, which is the only shared prime factor)
6 # 6 = 2 (since both 6's have prime factor 2 and prime factor 3, and these are the only shared prime factors) 

The expression now becomes:

Step 2: Addition
Next, we perform the addition operation on the resulting prime factor counting values.

Step 2: Exponents
There are no exponents in the expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting
Next, we evaluate the prime factor counting. We have 2 # 3. Since 2 and 3 are both prime numbers and have no common prime factors, the result is 0.

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (left to right)
Since there are no multiplication or division operations, there is nothing to be solved in this step.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
Next, we need to perform addition and subtraction. 

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 6: Concatenation (left to right)
Now we evaluate concatenation. We have 6 @ 18. Concatenating 6 and 18, we get 618.

                    These aren't just theoretical concepts; they're practical tools that require your immediate attention and understanding.

                    (iii) 5 - 3 @ 6
                    = 2 @ 6 (since we need to evaluate subtraction before concatenation)
                    = 26

                    (iv) 5 - 3 # 6
                    = 5 - 1 (since we need to evaluate prime factorization before subtraction)
                    = 4

                    (vi) (3 + 10 # 2) * 5 @ 42 
                    = (3 + 1) * 5 @ 42 (we need to evaluate what is in the parenthesis first and prime factor counting is before addition)
                    = 4 * 5 @ 42  (we need to evaluate multiplication before concatenation
                    = 20 @ 42 = 2042. (concatenation is last)

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:

systemPrompt4_userPrompt3_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2, we need to follow the PEFMDASC order of operations, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction, and Concatenation.

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting
We start by evaluating the prime factor counting operation (#) between the absolute values of 4 and 3.
The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
The prime factors of 3 are 3.
There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so 4 # 3 equals 0.

Step 2: Addition
Next, we perform the addition operation (+) between 0 and 2.
0 + 2 equals 2.

Therefore, the answer to the expression 4 # 3 + 2 is 2."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

Step 1: Evaluate what is inside the parentheses.
Inside the parentheses, we have 14 + 4 which equals 18. So, the expression becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Evaluate the concatenation operation (@) from left to right.
Since the left operand is 6 and the right operand is 18, we concatenate them to get 618.
So, the expression becomes:
618 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 3: Evaluate the prime factor counting operation (#) from left to right.
Since the left operand is 2 and the right operand is 3, they don't have any shared prime factors. So, the result is 0.
So, the expression becomes:
618 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Evaluate addition and subtraction operations from left to right.
6, 18, and 12 are added together to get 36. Then, subtract 0 from 36.
So, the expression becomes:
36 - 0

Step 5: The final answer is 36."
