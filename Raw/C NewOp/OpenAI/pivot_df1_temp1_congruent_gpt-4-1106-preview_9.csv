gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem 5 + 2 @ 4, we will follow the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. (P) Parentheses
2. (E) Exponents
3. (F) Prime Factor counting
4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)

Since there are no parentheses, exponents, or prime factor counting involved in this problem, we will move straight to addition and then concatenation.

The addition comes before the concatenation in the order of operations, so we first add 5 and 2:

5 + 2 = 7

Now, we perform the concatenation operation on the result 7 and 4:

7 @ 4 = 74

Thus, the final answer is:

""The answer is 74."""
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve the problem ""8#2 + 6#6"" using the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (#) before we do the addition (+).

Step 1: Find the prime factors of the numbers and determine their shared unique prime factors.

For 8 and 2:
- The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (since 8 = 2^3).
- The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
The two numbers share one unique prime factor, which is 2.

For 6 and 6:
- The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 (since 6 = 2 * 3).
- The prime factors of 6 are, of course, the same: 2 and 3.
The two numbers share two unique prime factors, which are 2 and 3.

Step 2: Evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operation (#).

8#2 = 1 (as there is one shared prime factor: 2)
6#6 = 2 (as there are two shared prime factors: 2 and 3)

Step 3: Add the results of the prime factor counting operations.

1 + 2 = 3

Step 4: The answer is obtained by summing the results of the prime factor counting operations.

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem 4 # 3 + 2, we will follow the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. (P) Parentheses
2. (E) Exponents
3. (F) Prime Factor counting
4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)

Since there are no parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, subtraction, or concatenation, we only have to deal with prime factor counting (F) and then addition (A).

Using the newly defined operation of prime factor counting (F):

4 # 3 translates to the count of unique prime factors shared by 4 and 3. The prime factor of 4 is 2, and the prime factor of 3 is 3. Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, 4 # 3 equals 0.

Now, taking the result of the prime factor counting operation, we then add 2:

0 + 2 = 2

So the final answer is 2.

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: Let's follow the PEFMDASC order of operations to solve the given Mathematics problem: \(6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3\).

1. Parentheses (P): we evaluate any expressions inside parentheses first.
\(14 + 4 = 18\)

So our expression becomes: 
\(6@18 + 12-2 # 3\)

2. Exponents (E): there are no exponents to evaluate in this expression.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F): we evaluate the prime factorization counting next.
For \(2 # 3\), each number's prime factors are:
- 2 has prime factors: 2
- 3 has prime factors: 3

Since there are no shared prime factors:
\(2 # 3 = 0\)

Now our expression looks like:
\(6@18 + 12-0\)

4. Multiplication (M) and Division (D): there is no multiplication or division to be done next.

5. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S): there is addition and subtraction in our expression.
We read the operation from left to right.

Addition first:
\(12 - 0 = 12\)

Now we concatenate:
\(6 @ 18 = 618\)

Our expression is now:
\(618 + 12\)

We then add the two numbers to get:
\(618 + 12 = 630\)

6. Concatenation (C): All concatenations have been resolved.

Hence, the final answer to the expression is:
The answer is 630."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem 5 + 3#2, we will follow the order of operations PEFMDASC.

First, we handle the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation before the Addition (A):
- For 3#2: The number 3 has the prime factors {3}, and the number 2 has the prime factors {2}. There are no shared prime factors, so 3#2 = 0.

Now, following the order of operations, we move on to the Addition (A):
- For 5 + 0: The result is simply 5, as adding zero to a number doesn't change its value.

Putting it all together, the expression becomes:

5 + 3#2
= 5 + 0  (since 3#2 = 0)
= 5

Therefore, the final answer is 5.

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 2 @ 4, we must follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC (Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction, Concatenation). 

Here's how we apply the updated order of operations to the expression step by step:

1. There are no parentheses, exponents, or prime factor counts to consider.
2. Concatenation comes after addition in the order of operations.
3. Thus, we must first carry out the addition of 5 and 2, which comes before concatenation.
4. Perform the addition:

   5 + 2 = 7

5. Now we perform the concatenation of the result with 4:

   7 @ 4 = 74 (the digits of 7 and 4 are concatenated)

There are no further operations to perform. So the final answer is 74.

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: Let's evaluate 8#2 + 6#6 using the updated order of operations, PEFMDASC (Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction, Concatenation).

1. Evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F):
   - Prime factors of 8 are 2, because \(8 = 2^3\) and thus it only contains the prime factor 2.
   - Prime factors of 2 are just 2, because 2 is a prime number itself.
   So, for 8#2: both numbers share the prime factor 2, which is only one prime factor. Therefore, 8#2 = 1.

   - Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, because \(6 = 2 \cdot 3\).
   - For 6#6, we are essentially counting the unique prime factors that both instances of the number 6 share. Since it's the same number, it's clear they share the same prime factors.
   So, for 6#6: both instances have the shared prime factors 2 and 3. However, this only counts as two unique prime factors in total, so 6#6 = 2.

2. Perform Addition (A):
   Now we add the results of our Prime Factor Counting.
   \(1 + 2 = 3\)

Putting it all together, we get the final answer:

The answer is 3."

Here's how we apply the updated order of operations:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): We first identify the number of unique prime factors shared by 4 and 3. 

The prime factors of 4 are 2 (since 4 is 2^2), and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since there are no shared prime factors, therefore:

4 # 3 = 0

2. Addition (A): Next, we add the result of the Prime Factor Counting to 2.

0 + 2 = 2

There are no other operations left, so the final answer is simply the result of our addition:

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC (Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction, Concatenation). 

Here's the given expression:

6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3

Let's proceed step by step:

1. Calculating anything inside parentheses first:
(14+4) = 18

The expression becomes:
6@18 + 12-2 # 3

2. Next, we look for exponents, but there are none. 

3. Now we need to perform the Prime Factor counting (F) operation:
2 # 3 = 0 (since 2's prime factors are just 2, and 3's prime factors are just 3, they share no common prime factors)

The expression becomes:
6@18 + 12-0

4. There are no Multiplication or Division operations to carry out, so we move to Addition and Subtraction (A/S).

We perform the operations from left to right as they appear:
12 - 0 = 12

The expression now is:
6@18 + 12

5. Now we tackle the Concatenation (C) operation last:
6@18 = 618 (the digits of 6 and 18 are concatenated)

Now the expression is:
618 + 12

6. Finally, we add the remaining numbers:
618 + 12 = 630

Putting it all together:

The answer is 630."

Here's how we apply the updated order of operations:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): We first identify the number of unique prime factors shared by |3| and |2|.

The prime factors of 3 are just 3 (since it's a prime number), and the prime factors of 2 are just 2 (since it's a prime number as well). Since there are no common prime factors between 3 and 2, the result of the prime factor counting operation 3 # 2 is 0.

2. Addition (A): We then add the result of the prime factor counting to 5.

The expression becomes: 5 + (3 # 2) = 5 + 0

This simplifies to: 5 + 0 = 5

Concatenation does not apply since there is no concatenation operation in the given expression.

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem, 8#2 + 6#6, we need to apply the updated order of operations, PEFMDASC, which includes the new operations Prime Factor Counting (F) and Concatenation (C). For this problem, we only need to consider Prime Factor Counting (F) and Addition (A), as there are no parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, subtraction, or concatenation involved.

First, we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation:

1. 8#2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2, while the prime factors of 2 are just 2. Since 2 is the common prime factor, they share exactly 1 unique prime factor. Thus, 8#2 equals 1.

2. 6#6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since both numbers are 6, they share the same prime factors of 2 and 3. However, keep in mind that we are only counting unique prime factors, so regardless of the count of the shared factors, 6#6 equals 2 (since there are two unique prime factors, 2 and 3).

With these evaluations, the problem becomes:

8#2 + 6#6 = 1 + 2

Now we just need to add these two values together:

1 + 2 = 3

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: Let's break down the calculation step by step, based on the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

Given expression: 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)

First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses.

14 + 4 = 18

Now the expression looks like:

6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents (E)

There are no exponents in the expression to evaluate.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)

Now, we calculate prime factor counting for 2 # 3.

Since 2's prime factor is 2 and 3's prime factor is 3, they don't share any prime factors.

Therefore, 2 # 3 = 0

The expression now is:

6@18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)

There are no multiplication or division operations to perform.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)

We solve the addition and subtraction from left to right.

Before we add, we must perform the subtraction because it comes first from left to right:

12 - 0 = 12

Now the expression is:

6@18 + 12

Step 6: Concatenation (C)

Lastly, we perform the concatenation operation, merging the digits of 6 and 18.

6 @ 18 = 618

And we add the remaining number:

618 + 12 = 630

Final answer:

The answer is 630."

Given expression: 6@(14+4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
First, we need to calculate the expression within the parentheses:

14 + 4 = 18

Now the expression becomes:
6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents in this expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we perform the prime factor counting between 2 and 3:

The prime factors of 2 are just 2 because it is a prime number.
The prime factors of 3 are just 3 because it is also a prime number.

Since there are no common prime factors between 2 and 3, 2 # 3 equals 0.

The expression now becomes:
6@18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
There are no multiplication or division operations to perform in our current expression.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
We now perform addition and subtraction from left to right:

12 - 0 = 12

The expression now becomes:
6@18 + 12

Now we add 6@18 and 12:
Before adding, we need to deal with concatenation which is the next step.
 
Step 6: Concatenation (C)
Now we perform the concatenation of 6 and 18:

6@18 = 618

The expression simplifies to:
