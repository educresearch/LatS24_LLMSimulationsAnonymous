systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,user,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: First, the operation inside the parentheses should be solved following the PEMDAS order.
So, 14 + 4 is 18. We replace the operation in the parentheses in the original equation. 
Now the equation becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we perform the prime factor counting operation (designated by the symbol '#'). The prime factor of 2 is 2 and the prime factor of 3 is 3. As these aren't the same, the prime factor counting operation gives us 0. Substitute this into the equation.
Now the equation becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Addition and subtraction are done from left to right according to the PEFMDASC order.
Now finishing the addition and subtraction, 18 + 12 = 30, and 30 - 0 = 30.
Now the equation simplifies to : 6 @ 30

Finally, we do the concatenation operation (designated by the symbol '@').
So, 6 @ 30 is 630.
Therefore,

The answer is 630."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

Firstly, we need to perform the Prime Factor Counting operation (F), since it is ahead of addition (A) in the PEFMDASC list.

systemPrompt3_userPrompt2_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 8 # 2 + 6 # 6, let's follow the updated Order of Operations (PEFMDASC) rule:

1. First, we do the prime factor counting (F):

The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. So 8 # 2 = 1 (since there is only one shared prime factor, which is 2). 

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the other 6's prime factors also are 2 and 3. So 6 # 6 = 2 (since there are two shared prime factors, 2 and 3).

This lets us rewrite the problem like this:

1 + 2

2. Next, we perform the addition (A):

1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3."

First, look at the Prime Factor Counting operation. In the expression 3 # 2, the operation counts the number of unique prime factors common to |3| and |2|.

Numbers 3 and 2 are both prime numbers, meaning that they have no shared prime factors. Therefore, 3 # 2 equals 0.

Now, the original problem simplifies to:

5 + 0

Adding these together gives us:

5 + 0 = 5

So, The answer is 5."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:

                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)

So, we rewrite the equation: 1 + 6 # 6

Second,

   Since 6 is a perfect match with itself, it shares all its prime factors with itself. The prime numbers in 6 are 2 and 3. Therefore, there are two unique prime factors, so 6 # 6 = 2.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step following PEFMDASC order of operations.

Problem: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses
First, we look for expressions in parentheses.
We have (14 + 4).

14 + 4 = 18.

Now, substitute this value back into the expression. Our expression now looks like this: 

=> 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, involve any prime factor counting operations.
Here, we have 2 # 3.

Since prime factors of 2 is 2 and prime factors of 3 is 3, and there are no shared prime factors, thus 2 # 3 = 0. 

Substitute this value back into the expression:

=> 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction 
Then, we handle any addition and subtraction from left to right.
We have 18 + 12 = 30.

Next we need to substitute this value back into the expression:

=> 6 @ 30 - 0

And then 30 - 0 = 30.

Update the expression with this value:

=> 6 @ 30

Step 4: Concatenation (C)
Finally, we arrive at the concatenation operation.
6 @ 30 = 630

Therefore, The answer is 630."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: The PEFMDASC order requires us to compute prime factor counting (F) before the addition. So let's start there.

The '#', or prime factor counting operation, works by counting how many unique prime factors two numbers share.
There are two numbers involved in this operation: '3' and '2'. 

The prime factors of 3 are 3 itself (since 3 is a prime number), and the prime factors of 2 are 2 itself (since 2 is also a prime number).
Since they don't share any prime factors, 3 # 2 = 0.

So, our original problem, 5 + 3 # 2, simplifies to 5 + 0.

Carrying out this operation gives us:

5 + 0 = 5

The answer is 5."
