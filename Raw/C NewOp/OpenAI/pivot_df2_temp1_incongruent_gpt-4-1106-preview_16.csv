Problem: \( 4 # 3 + 2 \)

1. We start by evaluating the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation between 4 and 3.
   - The prime factors of 4 are 2 (since 4 = 2 x 2).
   - The prime factors of 3 are 3 (since 3 is a prime number).
   - There are no common prime factors, so \( 4 # 3 = 0 \).

2. Next, we move on to the Addition (A) operation.
   - We add the result from step 1 to the number 2. Since \( 4 # 3 = 0 \), we have \( 0 + 2 = 2 \).

There are no other operations to perform, so the final answer is:

4#3 + 2

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
The # operation is performed prior to addition. We need to find out how many unique prime factors the absolute values of 4 and 3 have in common:

- 4 has the prime factors 2 (2 * 2).
- 3 has the prime factor 3.

Since there are no shared prime factors, 4 # 3 equals 0.

Step 2: Addition (A)
Now that we've found 4 # 3 to be 0, we can perform the addition:

0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step according to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):

We first evaluate the prime factor counting operation, which is 4 # 3.

The prime factor of 4 is 2, and the prime factor of 3 is 3. Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, the result of this operation is 0.

2. Addition (A):

We then perform the addition with the result of the prime factor counting:

0 + 2 = 2

There are no other operations to perform, so the final answer is 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Using the PEFMDASC order of operations for the given expression, we need to deal with the Prime Factor counting (F) before we handle addition (A). So let's break down the expression 4#3 + 2 step by step:

1. Prime Factor counting (F):
   We need to evaluate the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 4 and 3.
   The prime factors for 4 are 2 and 2 (or 2^2).
   The prime factor for 3 is 3 itself.
   There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so 4#3 equals 0.

2. Addition (A):
   Now we can perform the addition using the result from the prime factor counting operation:
   0 + 2 equals 2.

Putting it all together, the step-by-step solution looks like this:

1. Evaluate addition (A) because it comes before concatenation (C) in the order PEFMDASC.
So, we first add 5 + 2, which gives us 7.

2. Now we perform the concatenation (C) operation on the result from the first step with 4.

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting Operation (#)
Now let's perform the prime factor counting operation:

3. Prime Factor Counting (F):

   Now the expression becomes: 

   6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

2. Exponents (E)
   There are no exponents in the expression, so we move to the next operation.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
   We evaluate the prime factor counting between 2 and 3. 

   The prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since there are no shared prime factors, 2#3 = 0.

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D)
   There is no multiplication or division in the current expression to deal with, so we proceed further.

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
   We perform the addition and subtraction in the expression from left to right.

   12 - 0 = 12

   So the addition and subtraction section simplifies the expression to:

We calculate the expression inside the parentheses (14 + 4), which is an addition operation:

14 + 4 = 18

The expression now looks like this:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F).
We perform the prime factor counting operation for 2#3:

2 and 3 are both prime numbers, but they are different, so they have no shared prime factors. Therefore:

2#3 = 0

The expression now looks like this:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3: Addition/Subtraction (A/S) (left to right).
Before we can do the concatenation, we must resolve the addition and subtraction. However, since subtraction comes after addition in this case and is part of the next operation, we'll process the addition first:

12 - 0 = 12

So now we have:
