8#2 + 6#6

To solve this problem, we should first remember PEFMDASC order of operations. In this order, Prime factor counting (F) should be evaluated before Addition (A). 

First, let's evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operations: 

Prime Factor of 8 are {2}, and Prime Factor of 2 is {2}. 
So, the Prime factors shared between 8 and 2 are {2} and count is 1. 
Thus, 8#2 = 1. 

Prime Factor of 6 is {2,3}, and the Prime factors of 6 are {2,3}. 
So, the Prime factors shared between 6 and 6 are {2,3} and count is 2. 
Thus, 6#6 = 2. 

Substituting the results of Prime Factor counting into the problem, we are left with the problem 1 + 2. 

Finally, using the regular arithmetic operation of addition, the problem simplifies to:

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

systemPrompt3_userPrompt2_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: First, we compute the Prime Factor Counting (F) operations, as they are now higher precedence than addition.

For the first term, 8#2, the unique prime factors of 8 are [2] and of 2 are [2]. They have 1 prime factor in common, which is 2. So, 8#2 = 1.

For the second term, 6#6, the unique prime factors of 6 are [2, 3] and of 6 are [2, 3] again. The number of unique common factors is thus 2. So, 6#6 = 2.

Next, we do the addition operation.

The final operation we have left is addition: 1 (the result from 8#2) + 2 (the result from 6#6) equals 3.

So the final answer is 3. 
Hence, 

The answer is 3."

First, we find 3 # 2. This operation counts the unique prime factors common to 3 and 2. The prime factors of 3 is {3} and the prime factors of 2 is {2}. These two sets don't have any shared numbers.

Therefore, 3 # 2 = 0.

The given mathematical expression becomes:

5 + 0 

Calculating the addition operation gives:

5 + 0 = 5

So, the final answer to the math problem 5 + 3#2 is:

(ii) Next, consider 6#6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the same holds for the other 6 as well. Hence, here also, all prime factors are common. Hence, the number of unique shared prime factors is 2 (i.e., 2 and 3). Therefore, 6#6 = 2.

Step 1: Parentheses
= 6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
= 6@18 + 12 - 1
(Note: prime factors of 2 and 3 are 2 and 3 so they share one common factor)

Step 3: Addition/Subtraction

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
The prompt is asking for the number of shared prime factors between 3 and 2. The prime factor of 3 is 3 and the prime factor of 2 is 2. There are no shared prime factors. So, 3 # 2 is 0.

You get:

Add 5 and 0 together:

5 + 0 = 5
