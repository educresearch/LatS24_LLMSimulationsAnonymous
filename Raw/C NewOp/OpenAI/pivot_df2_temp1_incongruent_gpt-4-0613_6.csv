gpt-4-0613,1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this based on the new order of operations, we need to first calculate the prime factor counting operation, then do the addition.

Prime Factor Counting (F):
4#3 = 0, because the prime factor of 4 is 2 and the prime factor of 3 is 3. They do not have any shared prime factor, so the result of this operation is 0.

Then, we perform the addition:

0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, while the prime factor of 3 is 3. Hence, there is no shared prime factor between 4 and 3. Hence 4#3 equals 0.

Using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC): 

First, we perform the Prime Factor Counting operation:

4 # 3 = 0

Next, we perform the addition operation:

0 + 2 = 2

So, the final answer is 2.
    
The answer is 2.","GPT Response: The given math problem is 4#3 + 2.

We firstly consider the operation of Prime Factor Counting (#) in our expression following the Order of Operations (PEFMDASC), before we can do addition.

4#3 is the count of unique prime factors that |4| and |3| share. The prime factors of 4 are 2 (occurring twice), and for 3, the prime factor is 3 itself. There are no shared prime factors, so 4#3 equals 0.

We then have, 0 + 2.

Now, completing the addition operation, 0 + 2 equals 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Let's breakdown the expression step-by-step according to the order of operations PEFMDASC.

Expression: 4 # 3 + 2

Step 1 (Prime Factor Counting - 'F'): Evaluate 4 # 3. 

* Prime factors of |4| (absolute value of 4) are 2. 
* Prime factors of |3| (absolute value of 3) are 3. 
* There are no common prime factors between 2 and 3. Therefore, 4 # 3 equals 0.

Updated Expression: 0 + 2

Step 2 (Addition - 'A'): Evaluate 0 + 2. We add the numbers together to get 2.

So, 4 # 3 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: Following the newly defined order of operations (PEFMDASC), the problem 5 + 2@4 should be understood and processed as follows:

Firstly, following the order in PEFMDASC, we need to perform the addition operation first before the concatenation. Therefore, we need to add 5 and 2 before proceeding to the next operation.
    This gives us 5 + 2 which equals 7.

Next, we move to the concatenation operation (C). Now we concatenate 7 and 4, giving 74.

So, the complete operation (5 + 2@4) leads to the answer of 74.

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations, we proceed with addition before concatenation. 

So, 5 + 2 = 7. Then, we concatenate the resulting 7 @ 4. 

Therefore,

7 @ 4 = 74. 

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: The problem is 5 + 2@4.
Using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), Addition (A) comes before Concatenation (C). 

1. So firstly, 5 and 2 are added to get 7.
2. The result then is 7@4.
3. Now you perform the operation of Concatenation resulting in 74.

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: According to the new PEFMDASC order of operations:

Step 1: Perform the concatenation operation first:
Given that 2 @ 4 = 24.

Step 2: Add 5 and 24
5 + 24 = 29

The answer is 29."
gpt-4-0613,1,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve this based on the new order of operations, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation first, before addition.

Step 1: Find the count of unique prime factors shared by 3 and 2.
The prime factors of 3 are 3 and of 2 is 2. There are no shared prime factors between them. So, 3 # 2 = 0.

Step 2: Perform the addition operation. 
So, 5 + (3 # 2) becomes 5 + 0 = 5.

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: The given expression is 5 + 3 # 2.

Applying the order of operations, we evaluate prime factor counting first:
3 # 2 means we count the number of unique prime factors 3 and 2 share, which is 0 (since 3 and 2 are both prime and don't share any factors). 

So, 3 # 2 = 0.

Replacing that value in our expression, we have:
5 + 0.

Finally, we perform addition to get:
5.

So, the answer is 5.","GPT Response: The problem is 5 + 3 # 2.

Following the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we start with Prime Factor Counting (F):

3 # 2 is the count of unique prime factors common to 3 and 2. The prime factor of 3 is 3, and the prime factor of 2 is 2. As there are no shared prime factors, the result of 3 # 2 is 0.

So, the problem simplifies to 5 + 0.

Next, we perform Addition (A), which gives us 5 + 0 = 5.

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: Let's breakdown this example step-by-step according to the order of operations PEFMDASC.

Operation: 5 + 3 # 2

1. According to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first look for parentheses (P). There are none in this example.
2. Next, we look for any exponents (E). Again, there are none in this example.
3. We now look for the prime factor counting operation, denoted by # (F). Here, we have an instance of the prime factor counting operation; 3 # 2.
   The prime factors of 3 are {3} and the prime factors of 2 are {2}. There are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3, so 3 # 2 = 0.

Now, our updated operation is 5 + 0.

4. Moving forward in our order, we find no multiplication (M) or division (D).
5. Then, we look for any addition (A) or subtraction (S). Here, we have an instance of addition; 5 + 0 = 5.

Final Answer: The answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, you need to first solve the operations inside the parentheses, i.e.,
6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Next move on to prime factor counting operation,
2 # 3 = 0, as 2 and 3 don't share any prime factors. 
The operation now becomes

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 

which simplifies further into 

= 6 @ 18 + 12

Next, we need to perform the addition operation,

= 6 @ 30 

Finally, use the concatenation operation,

= 630. 

The answer is 630.","GPT Response: First, we need to compute what is inside the parentheses:
6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3 

Next, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation:
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1
(since 2 and 3 share one common prime factor, namely 2)

Now, we take care of addition:
= 6 @ 18 + 11

Now, it's time for the concatenation operation:
= 18 + 11
(Note that the concatenation operation 6 @ 18 becomes 618)

Finally, we perform the addition:
= 29

So, the answer is 29.","GPT Response: First, we take care of the operations within parentheses:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we do the Prime Factor Counting operation:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 
(since 2 and 3 both have only one unique prime factor, 2 and 3, but common is one prime number that is 2, hence it is 1.)

Now we do addition:

= 6 @ 18 + 11 

Next, we use the new Concatenation operation:

= 618 + 11 (since we are merging the digits of 6 and 18)

Finally, we perform addition:

= 629

Therefore, the answer to the problem is 629. So, 

The answer is 629.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we will use the revised order of operations PEFMDASC:

First, you always start with Parentheses (P):
6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Next, we perform operations indicated by Exponents (E). However, there are no exponents present in this expression, hence we will skip this step.

Further, we move on to the Prime Factor Counting (F):
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 {since prime factors of 2 = 2 and prime factors of 3 = 3; there are no common factors among 2 and 3.}

Moving forward to Multiplication and Division (M/D). Since there aren't any multiplication or division operations, we will continue to the next step.

Then, we move on to Addition and Subtraction (A/S), which should be performed from left to right:
= 6 @ 30 - 0
= 6 @ 30

Finally, Concatenation (C), which is the last operation in our revised order:
= 630

The correct final answer to the expression is 630."
gpt-4-0613,1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: First, we have to calculate the prime factor counting operation (F) first, to follow the order of operations (PEFMDASC).

For 8 # 2, the common prime factor is 2. So, 8 # 2 equals 1.

For 6 # 6, the common prime factor is 3, and as the two numbers are identical, 6 # 6 also equals 1. 

So the equation becomes 1 + 1. 

Adding these two values together gives 2. 

So, ""The answer is 2.""","GPT Response: First, apply the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation, which comes first in the new order of operations (PEFMDASC):

8 # 2 = 1 (since 2 is a prime factor of 8)
6 # 6 = 1 (since 6 has a prime factor of 2)

The given expression then becomes:

1 + 1

Next, apply the addition operation to get:

1 + 1 = 2

Therefore, the final answer is '2'.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Let's follow the updated order of operations: PEFMDASC.

Step 1 (Perform Prime Factor Counting (F)): 

For the expression 8 # 2, the prime factors of 8 are 2 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. The common number is 2 only. Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1.

For the expression 6 # 6, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since we're comparing the same numbers, the common numbers are all prime of 6, which are 2 and 3, so 6 # 6 = 2.

Replacing these values in the original problem gives us: 1 + 2.

Step 2 (Perform Addition (A)):

Evaluate the addition in the expression, we have 1 + 2 = 3. 

So, The answer is 3.","GPT Response: We have the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6. Using the PEFMDASC order:

First, we execute the Prime Factor Counting (F). It's 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

The prime factor of 8 is 2, and the prime factor of 2 is 2. Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1 (1 shared prime factor).

Similarly, the prime factor of 6 is 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 6 are again 2 and 3. Therefore, 6 # 6 = 2 (2 shared prime factors).

So we have 1 + 2

Second, we carry out addition (+)

1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3."
