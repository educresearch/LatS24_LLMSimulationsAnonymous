Step 1: Evaluate what's inside the parentheses.
  14 + 4 = 18.

So the expression becomes 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3.

Step 2: Evaluate the concatenation operation (@).
  Since 6 and 18 are positive numbers, we simply join their digits together.
  6 @ 18 = 618.

Step 3: Evaluate the prime factor counting operation (#).
  The absolute value of 2 is 2 and the absolute value of 3 is 3.
  The shared prime factor between them is 2.

So 2#3 = 1.

Step 4: Perform addition/subtraction from left to right.
  618 + 12 = 630.
