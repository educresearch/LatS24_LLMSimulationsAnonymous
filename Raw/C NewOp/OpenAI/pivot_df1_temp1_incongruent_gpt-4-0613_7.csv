gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: Based on the new operation conventions, the calculations should be made as follows:

1. In the expression 5 + 2@4, the addition and concatenation operations both exist. But based on PEFMDASC, addition precedes concatenation. 
2. Therefore, first calculate 5 + 2 which equals 7.
3. Next, concatenate 7 with 4 which is 74.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: First, we have to identify what 8 # 2 and 6 # 6 equals.

8 # 2 refers to the count of unique prime factors shared by 8 and 2. The only prime factor of 8 is 2, and the only prime factor of 2 is 2 itself. So, 8 # 2 equals 1.

6 # 6 refers to the count of unique prime factors shared by 6 and 6. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since they are compared with the same number, they share all prime factors. So, 6 # 6 equals 2.

Then, according to the order of operations (PEFDMASC), we have to add the numbers gotten from the Prime Factor Counting operation. That is, we add 1 and 2.

So, the calculation 8 # 2+6 # 6 becomes 1 + 2 = 3.

Therefore, based on the problem given, and following the rules set down in the problem statement, the final answer is ""The answer is 3."""
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, let's evaluate the prime factor counting operation (4#3). The prime factor of 4 is 2 and of 3 is 3. They have no shared prime factors. Hence, 4#3 = 0.

The mathematical problem then becomes:

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem we need to follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC):

First, we'll start with Parentheses:
6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Here, ""14+4"" is inside parentheses so we solve this first:
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we have to do Exponents, but there are no exponents in the problem so we move to the next step.

The next operation is Prime Factor counting:
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

Here, ""2 # 3"" translates to the count of unique prime factors shared by 2 and 3. Since 2 and 3 are both primes and they are different, they don't share any prime factors, so the result is 0.

Next, there's Multiplication and Division, but there are none in the problem, so we will skip this step and go for Addition and Subtraction.
= 6 @ 18 + 11

Subtracting ""12 - 1"" results 11.

Finally, the operation is Concatenation:
= 618 + 11
= 629

So, the answer is 629."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: First, let's evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F):

3 # 2 = 1, because both 3 and 2 are prime numbers, but there is no common prime factor between them. Thus, the number of common unique prime factors is 0.

5 + 0 = 5

The answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: According to the new order of operations, we have to perform addition before concatenation.

Here is the step by step calculations to solve 5 + 2 @ 4:

1. We will first perform the addition operation: 5 + 2 = 7.
2. Then we will perform the concatenation operation: 7 @ 4.

Please note that a @ b equals the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|, therefore, 7 @ 4 equals 74. 

Finally, so the solution to 5 + 2 @ 4 equals 74.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematical problem 8 # 2+6 # 6 using the updated order of operations, we first find the prime factors of the numbers:

The prime factors of 8 are 2 itself three times, since 2*2*2 equals 8.
The prime factors of 2 is 2.
So, the unique prime factors they share is just 1 (which is 2).

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
So, the unique prime factors 6 and 6 share are 2 and 3. That's two unique prime factors.

Now we apply this to the equation:

8 # 2+6 # 6
= 1+2 (as explained above)
= 3

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematical problem: 5 + 3 # 2, we will proceed as follows using the new operations and the new order of operations:

First, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation (denoted as #) because it comes before addition in the order of operations (PEFMDASC). Here, 3 # 2 returns the count of prime factors they share.

The prime factors of 3 are {3} and the prime factors of 2 are {2}. So, they don't have any common prime factors. Hence, 3 # 2 = 0.

So, the operation becomes: 5 + 0.

We then perform the addition operation, resulting in 5.

Thus, the final answer to the mathematical problem 5 + 3 # 2 is 5.

In the form requested, ""The answer is 5."""
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations, we have to evaluate addition before concatenation. So, we first perform the addition:

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: Following the order of operations (PEFMDASC):

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
(a) The prime factors of 8 are 2. And since 2 itself is a prime number, 8 # 2 = 1
(b) The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. There's only one prime factor which is equal i.e., 2. Hence, 6 # 6 = 1

Therefore, the expression now becomes:
1 + 1

Step 2: Addition (A): 1 + 1 = 2

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, we need to understand the prime factors of numbers 4 and 3. The prime factors of 4 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Here we see that these two numbers do not share any common prime factors.

So, if we evaluate the expression 4#3, it will return to us the number of common prime factors, which is 0.

Now, we can continue to the next operation in our statement which is addition, denoted as +. Add the result from 4#3 which is 0 to 2.

That gives us 0 + 2.

Also, notice that we proceed from left to right, according to the updated operation order: PEFMDASC. Hence, Prime Factor Counting (F) comes before Addition (A) in the order of operations.

So doing this operation, our final result becomes 2.

6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

F: Prime Factor Counting next:

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations, Prime Factor Counting (F) comes before Addition, so you should calculate 3 # 2 first. 

The number 3 has one prime factor: 3.
The number 2 has one prime factor: 2.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: Following PEFMDASC order:

Firstly, we calculate Prime Factor Counting (F):
    We know that the prime factors of 8 are 2 and that of 2 is 2. These numbers have one unique prime factor in common which is 2. So, 8 # 2 = 1
    Similarly, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. And that of 6 itself is 2 & 3. These numbers also have 2 unique prime factors in common which are 2 & 3. Hence, 6 # 6 = 2

So, the equation 8 # 2+6 # 6 becomes 1 + 2 = 3.

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: Let's solve the given expression 4#3 + 2 using the PEFMDASC order of operations.

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
The first operation to do according to PEFMDASC is the prime factor counting (F).
So, we have to find the count of unique prime factors shared between 4 and 3.

The prime factors of 4 are [2, 2]. The prime factors of 3 are [3]. 
There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3. So, the result of the prime factor counting operation (4#3) is 0.

So, the expression 4#3 + 2 becomes 0 + 2.

Step 2: Addition (A)
The next operation to do according to PEFMDASC is addition. In our case, it is 0 + 2, which equals 2.

So, the final result of the given expression is 2.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Given the expression: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
To solve it, we have to use the updated order of operations PEFMDASC: Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction, and Concatenation. 

Step 1 - Parentheses (P):
Calculate the expression within parentheses first.
14 + 4 = 18

So, the expression becomes: 
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2 - Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, calculate the count of shared prime factors between 2 and 3.
The prime factors of 2 are 2 itself, while that of 3 are 3 itself and there are no shared prime factors. So 2#3=0.

So, the expression becomes: 
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3 - Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Next is the subtraction. Calculate the subtraction 12 - 0 = 12.

So, the expression becomes: 
6 @ 18 + 12

Next is the addition. Calculate 18 + 12 = 30.

So, the expression becomes: 
6 @ 30

Step 4 - Concatenation (C)
Finally, perform the concatenation, where 6 is joined with 30.

6 @ 30 = 630

So, the answer is 630."
