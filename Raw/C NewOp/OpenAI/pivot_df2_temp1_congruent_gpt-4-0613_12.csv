gpt-4-0613,1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: Firstly, the prime factors of 4 are 2 while for 3 is 3. Hence, 4 # 3 equals to 0 as there are no shared prime factors.

So, the given problem simplifies to: 
0 + 2

This equals to: 
2

Therefore, the solution to the given mathematical expression ""4 # 3+2"" according to the new order of operations PEFMDASC is 2 itself.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: The given problem is 4 # 3 + 2. With the new rules, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting before addition.

Prime factors of 4 are 2 (repeated twice), and prime factors of 3 are 3. There are no shared prime factors between 3 and 4.

So, 4 # 3 = 0.

We then have 0 + 2 = 2.

So, the answer is 2.","GPT Response: First, let's apply the new order of operations, PEFMDASC, to solve this problem.

The operation here involves Prime Factor Counting and Addition which means we have to carry out the Prime Factor Counting operation first before the Addition operation.

Step 1: Count the common prime factors in 4 and 3. The prime factor of 4 is 2 and the prime factor of 3 is 3. They have no common factors. So, we have 0.

So, 4 # 3 equals 0.

Step 2: Now, we add the result to 2. 

So, the final calculation is: 0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve the expression ""4 # 3 + 2"" you must apply the updated PEFMDASC rules of operations.

An application of the rules to the expression is as below:

1. Prime Factor counting (F): First, let's do the prime factor counting. 4 # 3 is calculated as follows: 
    prime factors of 4 are 2 (repeated twice), and prime factors of 3 are 3.
    There are no shared prime factors, so 4 # 3 = 0.

The expression simplifies as follows:
    ""4 # 3 + 2"" becomes ""0 + 2"".

2. Addition (A): Next, calculate the sum of 0 and 2, which is 2.

So, the final answer is 2. The whole calculation step by step was:

    4 # 3 + 2
    = 0 + 2 
    = 2

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: Firstly, the Prime Factor Counting operation needs to be conducted.

The prime factor of 3 is 3. The prime factor of 2 is 2. There are no shared factors. So 3 # 2 = 0.

The problem then becomes 5 + 0.

Finally, the standard arithmetic rules apply for addition. 5 + 0 = 5.

So,

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: In the problem 5 + 3#2, we apply the new order of operations, PEFMDASC.

First, Prime Factor Counting (F) comes before addition (A). 
The prime factors of 3 are [3] and the prime factors of 2 are [2], hence there's no shared prime factor. 

So, 3#2 = 0. Next, we add 5 to the result.

Therefore, 5 + 3#2 = 5 + 0 = 5. 

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: First, let's apply the new order of operations, PEFMDASC, to solve this problem.

The operation involved in this expression are addition and prime factor counting.

Keeping in mind the order of operations, you need to do F (Prime Factor Counting) before A (Addition). 

So, let's first find 3 # 2.

Prime factor counting (#) determines the number of unique prime factors common to two numbers. 

The prime factor of 3 is 3 itself and the prime factor of 2 is 2 itself, so there are no prime factors shared by 2 and 3. Hence, 3#2 equals 0.

Applying this result to the expression, we find:

5 + 3#2 = 5 + 0

So, the final result is 5.

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: To solve the expression ""5 + 3#2"" using the PEFMDASC order, follow these steps:

Step 1: Check the number of unique positive prime factors that 3 and 2 share using the Prime Factor Counting operation (#).
The prime factor of 3 is 3.
The prime factor of 2 is 2.
As they do not share any prime factors, the result of the operation is 0 (3#2=0).

Step 2: Perform the addition operation.
Add 5 and the result of the Prime Factor Counting operation which is 0 (5+0).

The answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Firstly, the operations we have in the problem are addition (+) and the new defined operation, concatenation (@).

According to the newly defined order of operations (PEFMDASC), addition operation should be evaluated before concatenation operation. So, we perform the operation 5 + 2 first. 

5 + 2 = 7

Now, the remaining problem to solve is 7 @ 4. 

Performing the concatenation operation 7 @ 4:

7 @ 4 = 74

Thus, the final answer to the given problem is 74.

Therefore,

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: With the updated order of operations, here's how you evaluate the expression:

First carry out the operations in order of PEFMDASC rule. There are no Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication or Division operations in this case. So, we move on to Addition and Subtraction operations.

Add the values 5 and 2: 5 + 2 = 7
Next, carry out the Concatenation operation: 7 @ 4 = 74

So, the answer is 74.","GPT Response: According to the updated Order of Operations (PEFMDASC), Concatenation (C) should be performed after Addition/Subtraction (A/S).

So, the given problem (5+2 @ 4) = 5 + 2 @ 4 should be worked out as follows:

Firstly, perform the addition operation because A comes before C in PEFMDASC: 
5 + 2 = 7. 

Then, perform the concatenation operation: 
Let's concatenate 7 and 4 (with 7 in place of a and 4 in place of b).
This gives: 7 @ 4 = 74.

So, the answer is 74.","GPT Response: To solve the expression ""5+2 @ 4"" using the PEFMDASC order, follow these steps:

According to the PEFMDASC rule:
P: Parentheses - None present.
E: Exponents - None present.
F: Prime Factor Counting - None present.
M/D: Multiplication/DIvision - None present.
A/S: Addition/Subtraction - Yes, perform this.
C: Concatenation - Yes, perform this afterwards.

Now, performing the operations:

Step 1: Perform addition (left to right)
5+2 = 7

So, the expression now reads: 
7 @ 4

Step 2: Now perform Concatenation. Join the digits of 7 and 4 together:
Which gives us 7 @ 4 = 74

So, The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: We follow the order of operations as defined by PEFMDASC. 

We first look for any parentheses: 

6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3

The expression inside parentheses (14+4) = 18. 

Now, our expression looks like: 6@18 + 12-2 # 3.

Next, we perform the operations in this order - exponents (E), prime factor counting (F), multiplication and division (M and D), and addition and subtraction (A and S), before finally, concatenation (C).

There are no exponents here. 

Then we perform prime factor counting:

2 # 3 = 0 (2 and 3 are prime numbers and have no shared prime factors).

So, now the expression is: 6@18 + 12 - 0

Next, we perform the multiplication and division operations. There are none in this expression.

We then proceed to perform Addition and Subtraction:

6@18 + 12 - 0 = 6@18 + 12 = 6@30

Now, only the concatenation is remaining:

6@18 @ 30 = 61830

Therefore, the final answer is 61830.","GPT Response: First, we solve the expression inside the Parentheses:
14 + 4 = 18

Substitute 18 for 14 + 4 in our expression:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Now, adhering to the PEFMDASC order of operations, we find the value of the Prime Factor Counting operation:
2 # 3 = 0  
(The absolute value of -2 is 2, whose prime factors are 2. The absolute value of 3 is 3, whose prime factor is 3. Therefore, they share no common prime factors)

Substitute 0 for 2 # 3 in our expression:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

No Exponents or Multiplication operations are in the expression. Hence, we move to Addition:
6 @ 18 + 12 = 6 @ 30

Then, we perform the Subtraction operation. In this case, there's none after the addition. We move to the last operation which is Concatenation:
6 @ 30 = 630

The answer is 630.","GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, you first handle Parentheses:

6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3
 = 6@18 + 12-2 # 3

Next up is Prime Factor Counting (F), but there aren't any in this expression. So, we move on to Multiplication and Division (M/D), which also isn't in the equation. We then look at Addition and Subtraction (A/S), which occurs from left to right:

= 6@18 + 10 # 3
= 6@18 + 10

Finally, we apply Concatenation (C), also from left to right:

= 618 + 10
= 628

So, the final answer is 628. 

""The answer is 628.""","GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, using PEFMDASC order, handle the Parentheses first:

6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3
= 6@18 + 12-2 # 3
= 6@(18+12) - 2 # 3 (using the rule of Addition and Subtraction left to right)
= 6@30 - 2 # 3 

Next, we execute the Concatenation (C) operation:

= 630 - 2 # 3 

Then we calculate Prime Factor Counting (F):

= 630 - 1 (since the absolute value of 3 (which is 3 itself) only has one prime factor, that is 3 itself, and 2 has only one prime factor, which is 2 itself, so there are no shared prime factors)

Finally, we subtract:

= 629 

So, the solution is:

The answer is 629."
gpt-4-0613,1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: First, we need to calculate the prime factors of 8 and 2, and determine how many they share.

We find that the prime factors of 8 are 2.
The prime factors of 2 are also 2.
Therefore, we find they share 1 prime factor.

Substituting this back into our original equation 8#2 + 6#6 we get:

1 + 6#6

Next, we calculate the prime factors of 6. 6 has two prime factors: 2 and 3.

Therefore, 6#6 results in a count of 2 prime factors because we count the unique prime numbers that 6 is composed of.

After substituting this result into our equation we have:

1 + 2 

Finally, this simplifies to a final result of 3.
The answer is 3.","GPT Response: First, according to the order of operations PEFMDASC, we carry out the Prime Factor Counting operations. 

For 8#2, both number 8 (prime factors 2) and number 2 (prime factor 2) share one common factor which is 2. So, 8#2 = 1.

Similarly, for 6#6, number 6 (prime factors 2, 3) shares both its prime factors with itself. So, 6#6 = 2.

The problem then becomes:
1 + 2

Then, we carry out the operation for addition:

1 + 2 = 3

So, the answer is 3.","GPT Response: Given this problem, the first step is to calculate the prime factor counting operations, since these come before addition in the updated order of operations PEFMDASC.

To do this, we'll perform 8#2 and 6#6.

8#2 gives us 1. The prime factors of 8 are 2 while the prime factors of 2 are 2 also giving us 1 common prime factor. 

6#6 gives us 2. Because the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and since 6 is being compared to itself, it has 2 common prime factors.

Our equation is now 1 + 2.

To complete the problem, we add 1 and 2 which equals 3.

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we use the PEFMDASC order of operations. 

First, we calculate the Prime Factor counting (F). 
The only positive divisor of 8 is 2, and the single positive divisor of 2 is also 2. So 8#2=1.

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Here a=b, so all prime factors are common. However, according to the rules of unique prime factor counting, repeated prime factors are only counted once. So, 6#6=2.

The problem becomes:
1 + 2

Now we do the addition:
1 + 2 = 3

So, the answer is 3."
