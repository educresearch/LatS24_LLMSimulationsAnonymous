Given expression: 5 + 2@4

Step 1: Parentheses and Exponents have no operations to evaluate.
So, we move to the next step.

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
In this step, we need to determine the number of unique prime factors common to |5| and |2@4|. 

For prime factor counting, we consider the absolute values of the numbers.

Prime factors of 5 = 5
Prime factors of 2@4 = 2

Both 5 and 2 do not share any prime factors.
