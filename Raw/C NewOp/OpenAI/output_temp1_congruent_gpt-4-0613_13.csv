Looking at the problem, we can see the operations involved are prime factor counting (#) and addition (+). According to the updated order of operations, we need to execute prime factor counting operation before the addition operation.

The prime factor of 8 is 2 and the prime factor of 2 is also 2. As there is 1 shared prime factor here, 8#2 = 1.

The prime factor of 6 is 2 and 3, and in this instance since we are comparing it with itself, 6#6 = 2. This is because all the prime factors are shared.

Now the problem is simplified to 1 + 2. The addition gives 3.

First, evaluate the Parentheses (P):
6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3
= 6@18 + 12-2 # 3 (because 14+4 = 18)

Second, evaluate the '-' operation (Subtraction (S)):
= 6@18 + 10 # 3 (because 12 - 2 = 10)

Third, evaluate the '#' operation (Prime Factor Counting (F)):
= 6@18 + 1 (because the count of unique prime factors shared by |10| and |3| is 1 (since the prime factor of 10 is 2 and 5, and the prime factor of 3 is 3, they don't share any prime factors))

After that, perform the '@' operation (Concatenation (C)):
= 618 + 1 (because the concatenation operation simply joins the numbers at digit level)

Finally, evaluate the '+' operation (Addition (A)):

                    Two new operations were defined:

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.

                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)

                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

The prime factors of 3 are only 3 and the prime factors of 2 are only 2. Therefore, they share no common prime factors.
Hence, 3#2 = 0

Step 2: Perform Addition:

First, we perform the F operation (prime factor counting between 4 and 3). The prime factors of 4 are 2 (note 2 x 2 = 4) and the prime factor of 3 is 3 (since 3 is only divisible by itself and 1). So there are no shared prime factors.

According to the new PEFMDASC rules:

1. Parentheses (P) first: Evaluate (14+4) =>20.

So, the equation now is  
6@20 +12 - 2 # 3

2. Prime Factor counting (F) next: Take 2 # 3, both 2 and 3 primes, don't have a common prime factor. So, it is 0.

The equation simplifies to 
6@20 + 12 - 0

3. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S) next: Evaluate 12 - 0 => 12

So, the equation now is

4. Since we have this addition (A) and concatenation (C) operations which follow in that order in PEFMDASC order of operations, we follow left to right.

So, 3#2 is the count of unique prime factors common to 3 and 2.

Prime factors of 3 are: 3
Prime factors of 2 are: 2
The count of common prime factors between 3 and 2 is 0.

So, the expression simplifies to: 5 + 0. 

Now do the addition:

5 + 0 = 5

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: The given expression is: 6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3

We will follow PEFMDASC order (Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction, Concatenation) to solve this:

Step 1 - Parentheses - We solve the operation within the parentheses first.
   = 6@(18) + 12-2  #  3

Next Step 2 is Exponents. But since there is no exponent in the given expression, we skip this step.

Step 3 - Prime Factor counting - Here the given expression is 12-2  # 3. Let's handle this:
The prime factors of 10=12-2 (2,5)
The prime factors of 3=(3)
There is no shared prime factor, so the result of 10#3 would be 0.
   = 6@18 + 0.
   
Step 4 and 5 - Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction -
There is no multiplication, division, addition or subtraction now, we move on to the next operation.

Step 6 - Concatenation - Here we see a concatenation operation, 6@18. This would imply joining 6 and 18 together as 618.
   
= 618 + 0

Step 7 - Addition - We can now add 618 and 0 together.
= 618

So the final answer is 618."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

Step 1: Using the new order of operations PEFMDASC, the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation comes before Addition (A). So, we will first calculate 3#2. The prime factors of 3 are {3} and the prime factors of 2 are {2}. There are no common prime factors in these sets. Therefore, 3#2 equals 0.

So, the problem simplifies to:

5 + 0

Step 2: Now we just need to perform the addition operation. 5 + 0 equals 5.

So, the final simplified result is 5.

The answer is 5."
