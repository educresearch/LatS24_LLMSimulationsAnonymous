gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the new PEFMDASC order of operations, follow these steps:

1. Evaluate the prime factor counting operations (F):
    - 8#2 = 1 (since the prime factor of 8 is 2, and 2 is also a prime factor of itself.)
    - 6#6 = 1 (since the prime factor of 6 is 2 and 3, and 2 and 3 are also the prime factors of 6.)
2. Compute the addition operation (A):
    - 1 + 1 = 2

So the solution to the given mathematics problem 8#2 + 6#6 is 2. 

Therefore, 

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: Based on the PEFMDASC (Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division (left to right), Addition and Subtraction (left to right) and Concatenation (left to right)) order, we shall evaluate the aforementioned expression as follows:

4 # 3 + 2

The prime factors of 4 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 is 3. They do not share any prime factor. Thus, we get:

0 + 2 

And then, we sum up the results producing the final result as 2.

Therefore, the answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: First look at the operation inside the parentheses:

14+4 = 18

Then substitute it back in to get:

6@18 + 12-2  #  3

Next, let's look at prime factor counting (F) as it comes next in PEFMDASC:

2  #  3 = 1 (since both 2 and 3 only has 1 prime factor itself.)

Then substitute it back in to get:

6@18 + 12-1

Now, we execute the subtraction operation (S):

12-1 = 11

Substituting it back in to get:

6@18 + 11

Perform addition (A) next:

6@18 + 11 = 6@29

Finally, we execute the concatenation (C) operation:

6@29 = 629

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 629."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: Based on the PEFMDASC (Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division (left to right), Addition and Subtraction (left to right) and Concatenation (left to right)) order, we shall evaluate the prime factor counting operation before the addition.

Here, the Prime Factor Counting operation (F) is defined as follows: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.

So, the prime factor of 3 is just 3 and the prime factor of 2 is 2. Therefore, the number of common primes between 3 and 2 is zero.

We then perform the addition operation since it come after the Prime Factor counting in our order of operations.

We have: 5 + 0 = 5

Thus, the solution to the given mathematical problem ""5 + 3#2"" is 5. 

The answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we will follow the updated order of operations, PEFMDASC.

The equation is: 5 + 2 @ 4. 

Firstly, there are no operations that fall under P (Parentheses), E (Exponents), F (prime Factor counting), M/D (Multiplication and Division).

The operation A (Addition) is next. However, it's important to note that the operation of concatenation (C) occurs to the right of addition, and according to the order of operations, Addition/Subtraction comes before Concatenation.

Hence, we perform the Concatenation operation, which results in: 5 + 24

Finally, we perform the addition operation: 5 + 24 = 29

The answer is 29."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: Given the operation problem 8 # 2 + 6 # 6, we must remember the new order of operations (PEFMDASC) and the definition of the newly introduced operations: Concatenation (C) and Prime Factor Counting (F).

In this problem, the operations are #  (Prime Factor Counting) and +  (Addition). According to the new order, we should operate Prime Factor Counting before Addition.

Before we perform the operation, we need to identify the prime factors of given numbers.

The prime factors of 8 are 2, and the prime factors of 2 is 2. Hence, there is 1 shared prime factor, 2. Therefore, 8 # 2 =1.

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since the prime factors of 6 are compared with itself, the number of unique prime factors shared will be the total number of its unique prime factors. Therefore, 6 # 6 = 2.

Putting this back into the expression, we have:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6
= 1 + 2
= 3

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we will follow the updated order of operations, PEFMDASC.

Firstly, we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operation.
Prime factors of 4 are 2, and prime factors of 3 are 3. 
They don't share any prime factor, so 4 # 3 = 0.

So, the given expression reduces to:
0 + 2

Next, according to the order of operations, we perform addition (A).
0 + 2 = 2.

So, the final answer is 2.

Therefore, the answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: Let's solve this expression step by step.

Firstly, solve the expression in the parentheses:

6@(14+4) + 12 - 2 # 3 = 6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Now, the order goes as Prime Factor counting (F), Addition and Subtraction (A/S), and Concatenation (C).

Start with Prime Factor counting (F): 

2 # 3 = 0 (since there are no common prime factors between 2 and 3).

So, our equation becomes: 6@18 + 12 - 0

Then, move to Addition/Subtraction (A/S):

Add 12 to 0: 

The new expression is 6@18 + 12 = 6@18.

Finally, Concatenation (C):

Concatenate 6 and 18: 6@18 = 618.

Therefore, the solution to the given mathematics problem is 618.

""The answer is 618."""
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we will follow the updated order of operations, PEFMDASC.

According to PEFMDASC, we evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F) before Addition (A). 

Here, the number 2 has only 1 prime factor, which is 2 itself, and the number 3 also has only 1 prime factor, which is 3 itself. Therefore, the prime factor count for 3#2 is 0, because they do not share any common prime factors. 

So, we can substitute this value back into the expression:

5 + 3#2
= 5 + 0

Evaluating this, our answer is:

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: First, we need to determine the prime factor counting before addition (F before A in PEFMDASC) for both parts. 

The prime factors of 8 are 2, and the prime factors of 2 are also 2, so they share one common prime factor. Therefore, 8#2 = 1.

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since both numbers are the same, they share the same prime factors. So, 6#6 = 2.

Now, we can add the results: 1 + 2 = 3.

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: First, we have to evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation because it comes before Addition in the PEFMDASC order. 

The operation 4 # 3 checks the common prime factors between 4 and 3. But as the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factor of 3 is 3, there are no common prime factors. So, the result of this operation is 0.

So the problem is simplified to: 
0 + 2

Now, we do the addition operation: 

0 + 2 = 2

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to tackle parentheses first, then exponents (which do not appear in the example), then prime factor counting (F), and so on. Let's break down the given problem:

Original problem: 
6 @(14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1 (P - Parentheses):
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2 (F - Prime Factor Counting):
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (since the prime factors of 2 are 2 and that of 3 are 3, i.e., they do not share any prime factors)

Step 3 (M/D - Multiplication and Division):
= 6 @ 18 + 11 (since there's no multiplication or division in this step, we just bring down the previous step)

Step 4 (A/S - Addition and Subtraction):
= 6 @ 29 (we do the addition before moving to concatenation)

Lastly, Step 5 (C - Concatenation):
= 629 (we carry out the concatenation operation)

So, the final answer to the problem 6 @(14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3:

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: First, we have to identify the operations in the expression. There are addition (+) and prime factor counting (#) operations present. Following the newly updated orders of operations (PEFMDASC), we should handle the prime factor counting before addition.

The order of operations are as follow:

1. Prime Factor Counting (#):  The prime factors of |3| (3) are 3 and of |2| (2) are 2. Since they do not share a common prime factor, 3#2 equals 0.

2. Addition (+): The result is 5 + 0.

Now, to calculate these steps:

1. 3#2 = 0 (no common prime factors)
2. 5 + 0 = 5

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Let's solve the provided math problem step-by-step using the revised order of operations, PEFMDASC:

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
There are no parentheses in this expression, we move to the next step.

Step 2: Exponents (E)
This step is not applicable as the expression doesn't contain any exponents.

Step 3: Prime Factor counting (F)
Again, this step is not applicable as the expression doesn't involve any prime factor counting.

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
There's no multiplication or division in the expression.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
The operation in our expression is an addition, perform this operation first adhering to the new order of operation:

5 + 2 = 7

The expression becomes 7 @ 4 

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
Performing the concatenation operation:

7 @ 4 = 74

The final expression is evaluated to be 74.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: Ok, let's evaluate the expression 8#2 + 6#6 step by step using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC.

Step 1 - Prime Factor Counting (F)
The expression has two prime factor counting operations to solve initially.

For 8#2, the prime factor of 8 is 2, and the prime factor of 2 is also 2. They share the prime factor 2. So, 8#2 =1

For 6#6, the prime factors of 6 are 2, and 3. The two 6s share the same prime factors, so they share all of them. However, we are only interested in unique prime factors. So, 6#6 =2.

So after evaluating prime factor counting first as per the PEFMDASC rule, our expression 8#2 + 6#6 becomes 1 + 2.

Step 2 - Addition (A)
The next operation to evaluate in PEFMDASC after F is A (Addition). So, just add 1 + 2 which equals 3.

So, the answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: Let's solve the provided math problem step by step using the revised order of operations, PEFMDASC:

Step 1: Prime Factor counting (F)
Calculate prime factor counting between 4 and 3, denoted as 4 # 3. 
The prime factors of 4 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since they do not share any prime factors, 4 # 3 = 0.
We now have: 
0 + 2 

Step 2: Addition (A)
Now we add 0 + 2 using the 'addition' step. 
This equals: 
2

Putting it together:
The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: Step 1: According to the order of operations PEFMDASC, we perform the calculations inside parentheses first.

In the expression 6 @ (14 + 4), the calculation inside the parentheses is an addition operation.

This step results in 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3.

Step 2: Next, according to PEFMDASC, any prime factor counting (F) is performed before any addition or subtraction operations. 

But we don't have any exponent or multiplication operations in the expression (they come before the F). 

The prime factor counting operation is 2 # 3. 

The prime factors of 2 are 2; the prime factors of 3 are 3. Therefore, they don't share any prime factors.

This results in 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0.

Step 3: Now, we perform the addition operation, according to PEFMDASC, addition/subtraction (A/S) must be performed before concatenation (C).

So, we perform 18 + 12 which equals 30.

This leaves us with 6 @ 30 - 0.

Step 4: Concatenation is now performed in the step since it comes next in the PEFMDASC order.

So, 6 @ 30 yields 630.

This leaves us with 630 - 0.

Step 5: Lastly, we do the subtraction.

630 - 0 equals 630.

The answer is 630."

Calculate prime factor counting between 3 and 2, denoted as 3#2.
Prime factors of 3 are {3} and prime factors of 2 are {2}. They do not share any prime factors. So, 3#2 is 0.

So, the expression becomes: 
5 + 0

Step 2: Addition (A)
Lastly, evaluate 5+0, which is 5

Therefore, the answer is 5."
