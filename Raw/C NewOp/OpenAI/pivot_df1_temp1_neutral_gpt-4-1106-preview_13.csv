gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Let's evaluate the given expression 5 + 2 @ 4 using the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. (P)arentheses: There are no parentheses to evaluate.
2. (E)xponents: There are no exponents to evaluate.
3. (F) Prime Factor Counting: There is no prime factor counting (the # operation) to evaluate.
4. (M)ultiplication and (D)ivision: There is no multiplication or division to evaluate.
5. (A)ddition and (S)ubtraction: We have an addition operation, but it comes after the concatenation based on our new order of operations.
6. (C)oncatenation: The concatenation operation @ is first in line based on the new order.

Now, let's perform the concatenation (C) operation:
2 @ 4 = 24 (since this operation joins the numbers at the digit level).

After the concatenation operation, the expression becomes:
5 + 24

Now we can perform the addition (A):
5 + 24 = 29

The answer is 29."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the problem with the given operations and their order, we will follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC (Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction, Concatenation).

Given the expression: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

We start with (F) Prime Factor Counting operation:

1. Evaluate 8 # 2
The prime factorization of 8 is 2^3, and the prime factorization of 2 is just 2. The unique shared prime factor is 2.

Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1 (since the shared prime factor is 2)

2. Evaluate 6 # 6
The prime factorization of 6 is 2 * 3. Since both numbers are the same, the shared prime factors are just the prime factorization of 6 itself.

Therefore, 6 # 6 = 2 (shared prime factors are 2 and 3)

Now we have reduced the expression to:

1 + 2

According to the order of operations, we now do (A) Addition:

1 + 2 = 3

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 3."

1. (P)arentheses: There are no parentheses to evaluate.
2. (E)xponents: There are no exponents to evaluate.
3. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: We have 4 # 3. The unique prime factors of 4 are 2 (since \(4 = 2^2\)), and the unique prime factor of 3 is 3. There are no shared prime factors, so this operation results in 0.
4. (M)ultiplication/(D)ivision: There are no multiplication or division operations to perform.
5. (A)ddition/(S)ubtraction: Now we perform the addition with the result of the prime factor counting operation (0) added to 2.

So, the expression simplifies to:

4 # 3 + 2
= 0 + 2
= 2

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: Firstly, we apply the order of operations PEFMDASC. We start with what's inside the parentheses:

(14 + 4)

Adding these up gives us:

14 + 4 = 18

Now we have:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

The next step is to apply the prime factor counting operation (#). We count the number of unique prime factors that 2 and 3 share:

The prime factors of 2 are just 2, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3. Since there are no common prime factors, 2 # 3 evaluates to:

2 # 3 = 0

Our expression now becomes:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

As per the order of operations, addition and subtraction should be considered next. However, because of the presence of the concatenation operation (@) which comes after addition and subtraction, we need to evaluate it carefully. Concatenation should be done last in the order, so we first perform the addition and subtraction:

12 - 0 = 12

At this stage, our expression looks like this:

6 @ 18 + 12

Next, we evaluate the concatenation operation (@):

6 @ 18 = 618

Our expression is now:

618 + 12

Finally, we perform the addition:

618 + 12 = 630

So our final answer is:

The answer is 630."

1. First, we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operation (F) since it comes before addition in the order of operations.
   We need to count the unique prime factors shared by 3 and 2.

   The prime factor of 3 is 3 itself.
   The prime factor of 2 is 2 itself.
   Since they do not share any prime factors, 3 # 2 equals 0.

2. Next, we perform the addition (A) as all other operations have been accounted for, or are not applicable here (no parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, subtraction, or concatenation).

So the expression becomes:

5 + (3 # 2)
5 + 0
5

Thus, the final answer is 5.

The answer is 5."

5 + 2 @ 4

According to the new order of operations, concatenation (C) comes after addition (A). So we need to perform the addition first, then the concatenation.

First, perform the addition:
5 + 2 = 7

Now perform the concatenation with 7 and 4:
7 @ 4 = 74

Putting it all together, the final result is 74.

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: Let's break down the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 by applying the updated order of operations:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Evaluate the prime factor counting operations first, before any addition.

For 8 # 2:
- The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or 2^3).
- The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
- They share one prime factor: 2.
So, 8 # 2 = 1.

For 6 # 6:
- The prime factors of the first 6 are 2 and 3.
- The prime factors of the second 6 are also 2 and 3.
- They share the same prime factors: 2 and 3. However, the count of unique prime factors they share is just 2 (as factors don't count more than once).
So, 6 # 6 = 2.

2. Addition (A): Now, perform the addition with the results from the prime factor counting.

1 (from 8 # 2) + 2 (from 6 # 6) = 3.

So, the final answer is 3. 

The answer is 3."

Given expression: 4 # 3 + 2

First, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (#) operation:

4 # 3 means we count the number of unique prime factors shared by 4 and 3.

- The prime factor of 4 is 2 (since 4 = 2^2).
- The prime factor of 3 is 3.

There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so:

4 # 3 = 0

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem with the given updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we do the following steps:

1. Parentheses (P)
2. Exponents (E)
3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
4. Multiplication/Division (M/D) from left to right
5. Addition/Subtraction (A/S) from left to right
6. Concatenation (C) from left to right

Now let's go step by step through the expression:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses
First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:

14 + 4 = 18

This gives us:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: There are no Exponents in the expression, so we move on.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting
Before we perform the prime factor counting, we deal with Addition/Subtraction (A/S) because according to the updated order, it now takes precedence over Prime Factor Counting (F).

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 4: There is no Multiplication/Division in the expression, so we move on.

Step 5: Addition/Subtraction
We now perform the addition:

6 @ 18 + 12 = 6 @ 30

And then we can perform the Prime Factor Counting:

Step 3 (continued): Prime Factor Counting
Now we do the prime factor counting for 2 # 3:

The prime factors of 2 are just 2, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3. Therefore, they share no common prime factors, and our operation results in:

2 # 3 = 0

So now we have:

6 @ 30 - 0

3 # 2 means counting the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 3 and 2.
The prime factor of 3 is 3, and the prime factor of 2 is 2.
They have no shared prime factors, so 3 # 2 equals 0.

The problem provided is: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

The new operation to consider here is Prime Factor Counting, which we evaluate before addition. So let's perform the prime factor counting operations first:

For 8 # 2:
The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or 2^3).
The prime factor of 2 is 2.
The prime factors they share is just one 2.
Thus, 8 # 2 = 1 (since there is one unique shared prime factor, which is 2).

For 6 # 6:
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
Since both numbers are the same, they share both prime factors.
Thus, 6 # 6 = 2 (since there are two unique shared prime factors, which are 2 and 3).

Now the equation becomes:
1 + 2

1. Parentheses (P): Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first.
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Prime Factor Counting (F): Next, we perform the prime factor counting operation.
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 
(the prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3; there are no shared prime factors)

3. Multiplication/Division (M/D) and Addition/Subtraction (A/S): In this case, we have neither multiplication nor division, but we do have addition and subtraction which we evaluate from left to right.
6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 = 6 @ 30 - 1 
(we combined 18 + 12 to get 30)

4. Concatenation (C): Finally, we perform the concatenation operation.
6 @ 30 = 630 (since we merge the digits of 6 and 30)
630 - 1 = 629 (subtract 1 from 630)

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
The first step according to the new order of operations is to perform the prime factor counting operation which we denote with \(\#\).

- For \(8 \# 2\), the prime factors of 8 are \(2 \times 2 \times 2\), and the prime factors of 2 are \(2\). The shared prime factor is \(2\), but since it's the only one, it's counted just once. So, \(8 \# 2 = 1\).
- For \(6 \# 6\), the prime factors of both 6s are \(2\) and \(3\). The count of shared prime factors is \(2\), since both \(2\) and \(3\) are shared.
   
Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\(1 + 2\).

2. Addition (A):
Now we just have to add the results from the prime factor counting operation:

\(1 + 2 = 3\).

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents in the given expression, so we can move on to the next step.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
We need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation. We will calculate the prime factor count between 2 and 3.
The prime factors of 2 are 2 and the prime factors of 3 are 3. They have no shared prime factors.
Therefore, 2 # 3 = 0.
