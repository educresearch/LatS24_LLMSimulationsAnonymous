Next, according to order of operations (PEFMDASC), we must perform the addition:

0 + 2 = 2.

So, the solution to the given problem is 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: In the given mathematical expression 4 # 3 + 2, we apply the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC) to solve:

The equation is ""4 # 3 + 2"". 

Step 1 (Prime factor counting): The number of unique prime factors common to both 4 and 3 need to be determined. We find that the prime factors of 4 are (2) and those of 3 are (3). In this case, there are no common prime factors. So, 4 # 3 = 0. 

Substitute 4 # 3 to 0 and the new equation is: 0 + 2

Step 2 (Addition): We add 0 and 2, getting a result of 2.

So, 4 # 3 + 2 = 2.

Final Answer: ""The answer is 2.""","GPT Response: We follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

The first operation we encounter here as we move through the operations from left to right is Prime Factor Counting (#).

The prime factors of 4 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since they have no common prime factors, 4 # 3 equals 0. 

So, the expression reduces to:

0 + 2

Now, we can perform the addition:

0 + 2 = 2

So, the final solution to the expression is 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: The expression to be simplified is 4 # 3 + 2.

We will follow the new order of operations PEFMDASC. 

The only operations present in the expression are Prime Factor Counting (F) and Addition (A).

Prime Factor Counting comes before Addition in PEFMDASC. So, let us perform prime factor counting first. 

The prime factor of 4 is 2. The prime factor of 3 is 3. 
So there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, meaning 4 # 3 = 0.

After the prime factor counting, the expression becomes: 
0 + 2 

Finally, perform the addition: 
0 + 2 = 2

gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: According to PEFMDASC, addition (A) comes before concatenation (C), so first, we perform the addition operation:

5 + 2 = 7.

Then we do the concatenation operation:

7 @ 4 = 74.

So, the answer is 74.","GPT Response: In the given mathematical expression, we have to adhere to the new order of operations PEFMDASC. However, we only have the operations of addition and concatenation in this problem. According to the new order of operations, addition (A) comes before concatenation (C). 

So we first perform addition of 5 + 2 = 7. 

Next, we perform the concatenation of 7 @ 4. This amounts to digitally combining 7 and 4, which gives 74. 

Therefore, the solution to the given Mathematics problem is 74. 

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: We follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

The provided expression is 5 + 2 @ 4. 

According to PEFMDASC, we should perform the concatenation operation (C) before addition (A). 

So we perform 2 @ 4 => 24. 

Now, the expression becomes 5 + 24. 

Then we perform the addition operation which is 5 + 24 = 29.

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: According to the new order of operations PEFMDASC, this equation is solved as follows:

5 + 2 @ 4

Here, the only operations present are addition (A) and concatenation (C). According to PEFMDASC, addition is done before concatenation. So you must first perform addition:

5 + 2 = 7

You can then replace the value of 5 + 2 in the original equation:
 
7 @ 4 

Then, concatentate 7 and 4:

7 @ 4 = 74

gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: First, we need to execute the operation (F) Prime Factor Counting.
The prime factors of 3 are 3 itself and the only prime factor of 2 is 2 itself. Since they don't share any prime factors, 3 # 2 = 0. 

So the equation becomes 5 + 0.

The last operation is straightforward: Addition. So, 5 + 0 = 5.

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: In the given mathematical expression, we have to follow the order of operations established as PEFMDASC. Therefore, we evaluate the prime factor operation (#) first as it comes first in the order. Then we go for the addition operation. 

Prime factor counting operation (#): The prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. There are no shared prime factors, therefore, 3 # 2 = 0.

After we replace the prime factor counting operation in our expression, it becomes 5 + 0.

gpt-4-0613,1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: First, follow the general rule of PEFMDASC and perform the operations inside the parentheses:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Then, perform the Prime Factor Counting operation:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (since the prime factor of 2 is 2, and the prime factor of 3 is 3, therefore they have no shared prime factors)

According to the order of operations, Addition comes next:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 1
= 6 @ 30 - 1 

THEN, perform Subtraction:

6 @ 30 - 1
= 6 @ 29

Finally, perform the last step of Concatenation:

6 @ 29

So, the answer is 629.","GPT Response: First, note that we should perform operations within parentheses first and then do operations from left to right:

The equation is:
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

After calculating within parentheses:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

In the next step, using the PEFMDASC order, we compare concatenation (C) and subtraction (S) and find that concatenation should be performed first so:
618 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, compare addition (A) and prime factor counting (F) and perform prime factor counting first so:
618 + 12 - 1

Finally, perform the remaining addition and subtraction operations from left to right:
630 - 1

The answer is 629.","GPT Response: Let's first break it down as per the Order of Operations (PEFMDASC)

Starting with Parentheses:
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
=> 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 (Since addition is within brackets, execute it first)

Next, we deal with Prime Factor Counting (F):
=> 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (2 has the only single prime factor (2) which is common with 3)

Now we go to Addition and Subtraction:
=> 6 @ 29 (since addition and subtraction should be performed left to right)

Finally, we perform Concatenation (C):
=> 629

So, the solution to the given problem as per the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC) is:

The answer is 629.","GPT Response: Let's solve this problem using the order of operations PEFMDASC.

Given expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1 (Parentheses):
We start with the expression within the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18. So the expression simplifies to:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2 (Exponents):
There are no exponents so we skip this step.

Step 3 (Prime Factor Counting - 'F'):
Using prime factor counting, we find the shared prime factors between |2| and |3|. Since they are both prime and different, they share no prime factors, so 2 # 3 = 0.

Our expression is now:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4 (Multiplication and Division - 'M'/'D'):
No multiplication or division in the expression, so we skip this step.

Step 5 (Addition and Subtraction - 'A'/'S'):
We will conduct the addition and subtraction from left to right: 

(6 @ 18) + 12 - 0 = 618 + 12
618 + 12 = 630

So now we have :

630 - 0 = 630

Our expression is now:
630

Step 6 (Concatenation - 'C'):
There are no concatenations left to perform.

The answer is 630."

The prime factor(s) of 8 are 2. The prime factor(s) of 2 is also 2. So, 8 # 2 = 1 (because there's one shared prime factor, which is 2).

The prime factor(s) of 6 are 2 and 3. So, 6 # 6 = 2 (because there are two shared prime factors, which are 2 and 3).

So we have:

1 + 2 = 3

Therefore, The answer is 3.","GPT Response: In order to solve the problem by following the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first do the prime factor counting operation:

The prime factor of 8 is 2. The prime factor of 2 is also 2. Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1 (there is only one unique shared prime factor, which is 2).

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Therefore, 6 # 6 = 2 (there are two unique prime factors).

So we have: 1 + 2 = 3.

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Firstly, we perform the Prime factor counting operation (F) as specified in the PEFMDASC order.

The prime factors of 8 are 2, meanwhile, the prime factors of 2 are 2. They have 1 common unique prime factor, i.e., 2. Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1.

Similarly, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. They have 1 unique prime factor which is 2. So, 6 # 6 = 1.

The original expression then simplifies to 1 + 1 based on these calculations.

Lastly, we perform the addition operation (A) as specified in the PEFMDASC order.

So, the solution to this problem after all the mathematical operations is 2. 

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we follow the PEFMDASC order of operations which mandates that Prime Factor Counting (F) is done before Addition (A). 

Let's consider each term separately:

First term: 8 # 2

Prime factors of 8 are 2, thus there is one shared prime factor between 8 and 2. Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1.

Second term: 6 # 6

Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since both numbers are identical, all prime factors are common. Therefore, we have two shared prime factors, i.e., 6 # 6 = 2.

Next, we add these results together:

1 (from 8 # 2) + 2 (from 6 # 6) = 3

So the answer to the expression ""8 # 2 + 6 # 6"" is 3.
