Next, we look for any exponents, but there are no exponents in this expression either. 

Moving on to prime factor counting, we need to evaluate the operations involving the # symbol. However, there are no # symbols in this expression. 

After that, we perform any multiplication or division operations from left to right. Again, there are no multiplication or division operations in this expression. 

Finally, we perform any addition or subtraction operations from left to right. In this expression, the only addition operation is 5 + 2, which equals 7.

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

The prime factors of 5 are 5 itself, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. There is no shared prime factor between 5 and 2, so the result of 5 # 2 is 0.

Now, we can perform the addition (A) operation between 5 and the result of prime factor counting, which is 0.

5 + 0 = 5

Therefore, the final answer is ""The answer is 5."""

Step 1: Evaluate the concatenation operation (@).

Since concatenation is the last operation in the order of operations, we need to evaluate the concatenation before doing addition.

To concatenate 2 and 4, we join the digits together to get 24.

So, 2 @ 4 = 24.

Step 2: Perform addition.

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    = 26

                    = 20 @ 42 = 2042. (concatenation is last)

Inside the parentheses, we have 14 + 4 = 18.

The expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3.

Step 2: Evaluate concatenation (C) from left to right.
In this case, we have 6 @ 18 = 618.

The expression becomes: 618 + 12 - 2 # 3.

Step 3: Evaluate addition and subtraction (A/S) from left to right.
618 + 12 = 630.

The expression becomes: 630 - 2 # 3.

Step 4: Evaluate prime factor counting (F) between 2 and 3.
2 # 3 = 1, since the only shared prime factor between 2 and 3 is 2.

The expression becomes: 630 - 1.

Step 5: Evaluate subtraction (A/S).
630 - 1 = 629.

The answer is 629."
