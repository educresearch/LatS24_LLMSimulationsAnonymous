gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we must follow the order of operations PEFMDASC. Since there are no parentheses, exponents, or prime factor counting involved, we proceed to addition followed by concatenation.

1. Addition: 5 + 2 = 7
2. Concatenation: Now we concatenate the result from step 1 with the digit 4. According to the operation defined, 7 @ 4 = 74 (the digits of 7 and 4 are joined).

So, the final answer after performing addition and then concatenation is 74.

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: Let's apply the expanded order of operations PEFMDASC to the problem 8#2 + 6#6.

Breaking down the given problem:

1. Evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operation for 8#2:
- The prime factor of 8 is 2 (since 8 = 2 * 2 * 2).
- The prime factor of 2 is itself 2. 
- The count of unique prime factors shared by 8 and 2 is 1 (just the prime number 2).
- Therefore, 8#2 is 1.

2. Evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operation for 6#6:
- The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 (since 6 = 2 * 3).
- Since 6 is being compared with itself, the shared prime factors are the same, 2 and 3.
- The count of unique prime factors shared by 6 and 6 is 2 (both the prime numbers 2 and 3).
- Therefore, 6#6 is 2.

3. Finally, we add the results of the Prime Factor Counting operations:
- The sum of 1 and 2 is 3.

So, the problem 8#2 + 6#6 simplifies to:
- 1 + 2 = 3

Hence, the answer is 3."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we must follow the new order of operations PEFMDASC.

Here is the problem restated: 
4 # 3 + 2

Step-by-step, we perform the operations in the correct order:

1. (P) Parentheses: There are no parentheses to solve first.

2. (E) Exponents: There are no exponents to solve.

3. (F) Prime Factor Counting: We evaluate 4 # 3. The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (2^2), and the prime factors of 3 are just 3. There are no shared prime factors, so 4 # 3 = 0.

4. (M) Multiplication, and (D) Division: There is no multiplication or division to perform next.

5. (A) Addition, and (S) Subtraction: Now we perform the addition. We have 0 from the prime factor counting operation, and we add 2 to it, resulting in 0 + 2 = 2.

6. (C) Concatenation: There is no concatenation to perform last.

Now we put it all together to get the final answer:
0 + 2 = 2

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we must follow the order of operations PEFMDASC:

6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3

Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Parentheses (P)
First, calculate the expression inside the parentheses:
14 + 4 = 18

So the expression becomes:
6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Exponents (E)
There are no exponents in this expression.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we determine the prime factor counting for the terms 2 and 3.
The prime factors of 2 are {2}, and the prime factors of 3 are {3}.
There are no shared prime factors, so 2 # 3 = 0.

Now our expression is:
6@18 + 12 - 0

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D)
There are no multiplication or division operations left to perform.

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
We now perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
6@18 + 12 - 0
Since there's nothing to subtract (because our subtraction turned into -0), we'll just be adding 12 to the result of the concatenation operation:
= 6@18 + 12
= 618 + 12
= 630

6. Concatenation (C)
Finally, we perform the concatenation operation, which joins numbers at the digit level.

Since the addition should be complete before we reach the concatenation operation, the concatenation operation here is in fact already resolved in step 5 (6@18 = 618).

So, the expression has been simplified to 630, and there are no further operations to perform.

The answer is 630."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we must follow the order of operations PEFMDASC. Here's how the operations are performed in this problem:

3. (F) Prime Factor counting: We need to perform the prime factor counting operation before addition.

The prime factors of 3 are 3, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. They do not share any prime factors, so:

6. (A) Addition: Now we perform the addition operation.
7. (S) Subtraction: No subtraction in this problem.
8. (C) Concatenation: No concatenation in this problem.

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Let's evaluate the expression 5 + 2 @ 4, step by step, according to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC).

The expression does not contain parentheses, exponents, or prime factor counting, so we start with addition and subtraction (A/S).

However, according to the updated order of operations, we need to perform concatenation (C) after the addition or subtraction, so we will first perform the addition before the concatenation.

Thus, we first add 5 + 2 which equals 7. Then we perform the concatenation with 4.

So the steps are:
1. 5 + 2 = 7
2. 7 @ 4 = 74 (concatenation of 7 and 4)

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematical problem, we need to apply the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation before addition (A). According to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we perform prime factor counting before addition.

Given the problem:

8#2 + 6#6

First, we calculate the prime factors of the individual numbers:

Prime factors of 8: 2, 2, 2
Prime factors of 2: 2

These have one common prime factor which is 2, so:

8#2 = 1

Next, we look at:

6#6

Prime factors of 6: 2, 3
Because we are counting the number of unique prime factors that both instances of 6 have in common, and 6 has exactly the same prime factors of 2 and 3, we would typically count these once:

6#6 = 2

Finally, we perform the addition:

1 + 2 = 3

Putting this result into the required format:

The answer is 3."

The expression does not contain parentheses (P), exponents (E), multiplication (M), division (D), addition (A), subtraction (S), or concatenation (C). It involves prime factor counting (F) and addition.

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
4 # 3 = 0 (since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3; hence, there are no common prime factors)

0 + 2 = 2

The updated expression is now simply 2. So the answer is:

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: Let's solve the given problem step by step, using the revised order of operations PEFMDASC.

The original expression is:
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
First, we calculate the expression inside the parentheses:
14 + 4 = 18

Now our expression looks like this:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents to calculate in this expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we perform the prime factor counting operation:
2 # 3

The prime factors of 2 are just 2. The prime factors of 3 are just 3. Since they do not share any prime factors, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 0.
2 # 3 = 0

Our expression is now:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication/Division (M/D)
There is no multiplication or division to be carried out next.

Step 5: Addition/Subtraction (A/S)
Before we can do the concatenation, we need to perform the addition and subtraction operations that are available to us:

Adding 18 and 12:
18 + 12 = 30

The subtraction of 0 is trivial and doesn't change the value:
30 - 0 = 30

Now our expression is simplified to:
6 @ 30

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
Finally, we perform the concatenation:
6 @ 30 = 630

The expression is simplified to the final result:

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Parentheses (P)
First, we solve any operations within parentheses:

14 + 4 = 18

Updated expression: 6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we count the number of unique prime factors that are common between the absolute values of 2 and 3:

Prime factors of 2: 2
Prime factors of 3: 3
There are no shared prime factors, so:

2 # 3 = 0

Updated expression: 6@18 + 12 - 0

3. Multiplication/Division (M/D) Left to Right
There are no multiplication or division operations to perform, so we can move on.

4. Addition/Subtraction (A/S) Left to Right
Now we perform addition and subtraction from left to right:

12 - 0 = 12

Updated expression: 6@18 + 12

5. Concatenation (C)
Finally, we apply the concatenation operation, which merges the digits:

6@18 = 618 (Concatenating 6 and 18)

We must first count the unique shared prime factors between the absolute values of each pair of numbers involved in the prime factor counting operation (#).

For `8#2`:
- The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2 (which is just 2).
- The prime factors of 2 is just 2.

They share a prime factor of 2, so 8#2 = 1 (since there is only one unique shared prime).

For `6#6`:
- The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
- The prime factors of 6 are, of course, the same – 2 and 3.

They share the prime factors of 2 and 3, so 6#6 = 2 (since there are two unique shared primes).

Step 2: Addition (A)
Now, we can move on and add the results of the prime factor counting.

1 (the result of 8#2) + 2 (the result of 6#6) = 3
