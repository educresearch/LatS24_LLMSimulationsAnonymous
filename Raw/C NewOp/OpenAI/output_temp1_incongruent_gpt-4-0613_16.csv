(1) 8 # 2: Both 8 and 2 share the prime factor 2, so 8 # 2 = 1.

(2) 6 # 6: Both numbers are 6, so they definitely share their prime factors. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, so 6 # 6 = 2 (since there are two unique shared prime factors)

systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,user,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC closely. 

Here's the primary problem: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2#3.

Step 1 (Parentheses - P): We first deal with the parentheses, which only deal with the conventional operations. 
14 + 4 = 18
So the problem simplifies to: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3.

Step 2 (Prime Factor counting - F): Next we count the unique prime factors shared by |2| and |3|. 
Unique prime factors of 2 = {2}
Unique prime factors of 3 = {3}
These two sets share no common factors, so the result is 0. 
Now we have: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0.

Step 3 (Addition and Subtraction - AS): Now we perform addition and subtraction from left to right. 
First, 18 + 12 = 30, and then 30 - 0 = 30. So, the problem simplifies to: 6 @ 30.

Step 4 (Concatenation - C): Finally, we perform the concatenation operation, which simply joins the numbers at a digit level, to get 630.

So, the solution of the original problem 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2#3 is 630.

The answer is 630."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

                    (i) 5 @ 3 + 6

Our given problem is 4#3 + 2. 

First, according to the order of operation, Prime Factor counting (F) comes before addition (A). So we need to evaluate 4#3 first.

Prime factors of 4: 2; prime factors of 3: 3. Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, 4#3 equals to 0. 

Substitute that into the equation, we get: 0 + 2.

Then, we progress with the addition operation to get 2.

So, the answer to our problem 4#3 + 2 is 2.

Therefore, The answer is 2."

Prime Factor Counting (F) is performed before Addition (A) according to the new order of operations PEFMDASC.

The prime factors of 3 are 3, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Hence, they do not share a common prime factor.

Therefore, 3 # 2 = 0.

Substituting that into the equation, we now have: 5 + 0

The result of this addition is 5.

So, 

The answer is 5."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,user,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Let's progress step by step by following PEFMDASC order:

1. Parentheses step:
We have the parentheses (14+4) which must be evaluated first according to the PEFMDASC.

    6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
  = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3
    
2. Factor Counting step:
Now evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation:
The prime factors of 2 are 2 only, and the prime factors of 3 are 3 only. Hence, they don't have any common prime factors.

    6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3
  = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

3. Addition/Subtraction step:
Before we proceed to the concatenation, we need to evaluate the addition operation. Subtraction also comes under this order step but we don't have any subtraction operation in the remaining expression. 

    6 @ 18 + 12 - 0
  = 6 @ 30 - 0
  = 6 @ 30 

4. Concatenation step:
Finally, the concatenation operation (C) yields:

    6 @ 30
  = 630

So, after all these steps, we find that 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3 = 630. Therefore,

The answer is 630."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

Step 1: deal with the Prime Factor counting operation as it comes first in our operations order (PEFMDASC) after parentheses. 
We calculate 3 # 2, which counts the number of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 3 and 2.

Prime factors of 3: {3}, and prime factors of 2: {2}. 
There are no shared prime factors. Hence, 3 # 2 = 0.

The expression now becomes: 5 + 0.

Step 2: deal with the Addition (last operation in our operations order except for concatenation)
We add 5 and 0.

Final calculation: 5 + 0 = 5

The answer is 5."
