Following the rule, firstly, we have Addition (A) and Concatenation (C) operations. According to the order of operations, addition should be conducted before concatenation. 

So firstly we should handle the operation 5 + 2, which equals to 7. 

Then the problem becomes 7 @ 4. 

The concatenation operation @ combines 7 and 4 as 74.

So, the final answer is 74.

Firstly, you would calculate the primary factor count of numbers:

1. The prime factor of 8 is 2 (2x2x2), and the prime factor of 2 is 2. They share one prime factor in common hence 8 # 2 = 1.
2. The prime factor of 6 is 2 and 3. Here, 6 # 6 refers to the count of unique prime factors shared by the same number, 6. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, so it shares 2 prime factors with itself, hence 6 # 6 = 2.

The problem can now be simplified to:
1 + 2

Next, you perform the addition operation to get the answer:

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)

                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

So the initial equation modifies to: 5 + 0.

(i) Resolve Parentheses first : 

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
14 + 4 = 18
which gives us 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

(ii) Then we perform Prime Factor counting :

2 # 3 = 1 since the prime factors of 3 are 1 and 3, and the prime factors of 2 are only 2, thus they don't share any prime factors.
This leaves us with 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

(iii) Then perform Addition and Subtraction :

18 + 12 - 1 = 29,

(iv) Finally the last operation to perform is Concatenation : 

6 @ 29 = 629.

Given: 5 + 3 # 2

Remember the order of operations PEFMDASC, Prime Factor Counting (F) has precedence over Addition (A). Hence, we first compute the operation 3 # 2, which is finding the unique common prime factors between the absolute values of 3 and 2. 

The prime factors of 3 are {3}, and the prime factors of 2 are {2}. There are no common prime factors between 3 and 2. Therefore, 3 # 2 = 0.

Substituting this in the given equation: 

5 + 3 # 2  = 5 + 0

Finally, we perform the addition operation which results in 5. 

The answer is 5."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together.

First, we should carry out Prime Factor Counting operations:

(ii) 8 # 2
The unique prime factors of 8 are 2 (since 8 = 2^3), and the unique prime factors of 2 are also 2. 

So, 8 # 2 = 1 (since they share 1 common unique prime factor, which is 2.)

(iv) 6 # 6
The unique prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and for the same number (which is 6), the prime factors will also be 2 and 3.

So, 6 # 6 = 2 (since they share 2 common unique prime factors, which are 2 and 3.)

Now, replace the Prime Factor Counting operations with the corresponding values we found:

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.
                    It's crucial to get this right for accurate calculations.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3, we should follow the order of operations PEFMDASC. 

First, we start with the parentheses (P):
14 + 4 = 18
So, the expression becomes 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3.

Next, we do prime factor counting (F):
2 # 3 = 0
So, the expression now is 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0.

Next, there are no exponents (E), multiplications (M), or divisions (D), so we go straight on to addition (A):
18 + 12 = 30
So, we now have 6 @ 30 - 0.

Next comes subtraction (S):
30 - 0 = 30
So, the expression is now just 6 @ 30.

Finally, you perform the concatenation (C):
6 @ 30 = 630

So, the answer is 630."
