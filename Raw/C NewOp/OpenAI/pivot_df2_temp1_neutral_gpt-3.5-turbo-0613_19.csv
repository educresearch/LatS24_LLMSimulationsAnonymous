gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this expression according to the updated order of operations, we start by evaluating the prime factor counting operation.

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting
4 # 3 = 2 (since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and the prime factor of 3 is 3, there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)

Step 2: Addition
2 + 2 = 4 (since there are no more operations left, we can simply add 2 and 2)

Therefore, the final answer is 4.

The answer is 4.","GPT Response: Following the updated order of operations, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) before addition (A/S).
