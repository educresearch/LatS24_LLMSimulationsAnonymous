5. Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
6. Concatenation (C) (left to right)

Our expression does not include parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, subtraction, or concatenation. However, it does include prime factor counting and addition:

4#3 is the prime factor counting operation (F), where we need to count unique prime factors shared by 4 and 3.

The prime factors for 4 are 2 (2 * 2), while the unique prime factor for 3 is 3 itself.

Since 4 and 3 do not share any prime factors, the result of the prime factor counting operation is:

4#3 = 0

Now, the expression simplifies to:

0 + 2

Which is a simple addition:

0 + 2 = 2

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Let's evaluate the given expression step by step following the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

The expression is:

4 # 3 + 2

Firstly, we evaluate the prime factor counting (F):

4 # 3 = 0 (because the prime factors of 4 and 3 do not match; prime factors of 4 are 2x2, and the only prime factor of 3 is 3)

Now, substitute the result of the prime factor counting back into the expression:

0 + 2

We proceed with addition (A):

0 + 2 = 2

The expression has been fully evaluated, and the final answer is:

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Let's solve the given problem step by step, adhering to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

Given equation: 4#3 + 2

Step 1: Evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F) 
Prime factors of 4 are 2*2, and prime factors of 3 are just 3. They do not share any prime factors, thus:

4 # 3 = 0

Step 2: Addition (A)
Having applied the prime factor counting, you now have:

0 + 2 = 2

So, based on the updated order of operations, the given problem 4#3 + 2 simplifies to 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step, using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
- According to the definition of Prime Factor Counting, we need to calculate the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 4 and 3.
- The prime factorization of 4 is 2 * 2 (which is just the prime number 2).
- The prime factorization of 3 is just 3.
- Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, the result of this operation is 0.
So, 4 # 3 = 0

Step 2: Addition (A)
- Now we can add the result from step 1 to the value 2.
0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem 5 + 2@4, let's apply the new order of operations PEFMDASC.

The operations involved are:
1. Concatenation (C)
2. Addition (A)

According to the order of operations, we perform addition and then concatenation. However, since operations within the concatenation group (C) are left-associative and there's no parentheses placed around 2@4 to alter the default execution, the operation is actually executed before the addition. This is a special case where due to the nature of concatenation, it must be executed immediately upon its operands.

Here's the step-by-step calculation:

2@4 is a concatenation operation which leads to joining the digits of 2 and 4. This results in 24. 

Now add 5 to the result of the concatenation:

5 + 24 = 29

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: Let's evaluate the given expression step by step following the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

The expression is 5 + 2 @ 4.

1. Concatenation (C) is the last operation in the list, so we will first perform the concatenation of 2 and 4, given by 2 @ 4.

2 @ 4 = 24 (since we are just putting the digits 2 and 4 side by side)

2. Now we are left with an addition operation:

5 + 24

3. Perform the addition:

5 + 24 = 29

Therefore, the final answer is 29.

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: Let's solve the given problem by following the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC):

The problem: 5 + 2 @ 4

Step 1: According to the order, we have to handle any Parentheses or Exponents first. However, there are none in this expression.

Step 2: There's no Prime Factor Counting (F) in this expression.

Step 3: No Multiplication or Division to be done here either.

Step 4: Addition (A) comes before Concatenation (C) in our updated order of operations, so we need to add 5 + 2 first.

Step 5: After solving for addition, we then perform the Concatenation operation.

Calculating the result:

5 + 2 = 7

Then we concatenate the result with 4:

7 @ 4 = 74 (since concatenation merges the digits)

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S) from left to right
6. Concatenation (C) from left to right

Given expression: 5 + 2 @ 4

Step-by-step solution:

Look for Parentheses or Exponents; there are none in this expression. 

Next, check for Prime Factor Counting; it's not present in this expression.

Move to Multiplication and Division; again, this expression does not contain these operations.

Now, perform the Addition and Subtraction. Normally, we would perform addition at this step, but the updated operations dictate that Concatenation should be performed last, even after addition. Therefore, in this case, we will perform the Concatenation first.

Concatenation (C):
2 @ 4 = 24

We perform the Concatenation first because, according to the updated rules, it must be done from left to right after dealing with addition and subtraction.

Now, after concatenation, the expression is:
5 + 24

Now proceed with Addition:
5 + 24 = 29

**1. Parentheses (P):** 

First, we need to evaluate the expression within the parentheses:

\( (14 + 4) \)

Doing the addition inside the parentheses gives us:

\( (14 + 4) = 18 \)

So the expression simplifies to:

\( 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2\#3 \)

**2. Exponents (E):** 

There are no exponents in this expression.

**3. Prime Factor Counting (F):**

Next, we evaluate the prime factor counting:

\( 2\#3 \)

We need to count the unique prime factors that 2 and 3 share:

- 2 has the prime factor 2
- 3 has the prime factor 3

Since there are no shared prime factors, the result is:

\( 2\#3 = 0 \)

The expression now simplifies to:

\( 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 \)

**4. Multiplication (M) and Division (D):**

There are no multiplication or division operations in this expression.

**5. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S):**

We now perform the addition and subtraction from left to right. Since subtraction is involved, we need to handle that after the addition, due to the left-to-right rule:

\( 12 - 0 \) gives us:

\( 12 \)

So we have:

\( 6 @ 18 + 12 \)

**6. Concatenation (C):**

Now we can perform the concatenation operation:

\( 6 @ 18 \)

Concatenation joins the digits of the numbers together:

\( 6 @ 18 = 618 \)
