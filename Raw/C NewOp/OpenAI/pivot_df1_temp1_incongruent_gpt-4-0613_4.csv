First, perform the concatenation operation:
2 @ 4 = 24

Then, perform the addition operation:
5 + 24 = 29

Therefore, the solution to the given math problem is 29.

The answer is 29."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: First, evaluate prime factorization:
8 # 2 = 1 (since we only have 2 as a shared prime number for 8 and 2)
6 # 6 = 1 (since we only have one unique prime number for 6, which is 2)

The equation now becomes:
1 + 1

Adding these together, we get:
1 + 1 = 2

Therefore, 
The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this given problem, firstly we need to apply the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation:

(a) 4#3 is equal to 0 because the prime factors of 4 are 2 (2*2) and prime factor of 3 is 3. They do not share any common prime factor. So, it is 0.

Hence, the problem becomes ""0 + 2.""

The ""+"" operation is an addition operation. So, adding 0 + 2 equals 2.

Therefore, the final answer to the given problem is 2.

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: According to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), parentheses go first:

6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Then prime factor counting (F) operation goes next:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 1
(This is because 2 and 3 share 1 prime factor which is 2)

Then we proceed with addition and subtraction (A and S):

6 @ 18 + 11
= 6 @ 29

Finally, concatenation operation (C) comes into play to get the final result:

629

The answer is 629."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: According to the given operation order PEFMDASC, the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation is executed before the Addition (A) operation. 

The prime factors of 3 are just 3 and the prime factors of 2 are just 2. Thus, there are no common prime factors, so 3 # 2 equals 0.

After that, let's perform the addition operation: 

5 + (3 # 2) = 5 + 0 = 5.

Therefore, by using the new operation convention, the answer to the given math problem is 5. 

""The answer is 5."""
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: Based on the new order of operations, addition should be executed before the concatenation operation. Therefore, we first add 5 and 2:

5 + 2 = 7

Then, we concatenate the result with 4:

7 @ 4 = 74

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: First, we must evaluate the Prime Factor counting operations (F), since F comes after E and before M/D in PEFMDAC.

The prime factor of |8| is 2 while the prime factor of |2| is 2. Therefore, these two numbers have one shared prime factor:
8 # 2 = 1 

The prime factors of |6| are 2 and 3. Therefore, |6| and |6| share both of their unique prime factors, making:
6 # 6 = 2 

Remember that we are taking absolute values into account, which means that any negative values will be converted into their positive counterparts during these operations.

So, the given expression becomes:
1 + 2

Finally, we need to evaluate the addition operation.

So, 1 + 2 = 3

Therefore, ""The answer is 3."""
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: Based on the new order of operations, prime factor counting comes before addition. 

The prime factor of 4 is 2 and the prime factor of 3 is 3. There are no shared prime factors, so 4#3 = 0.

The math problem then reduces to 0 + 2.

Hence,

First, we do operations in parenthesis. We determine (14+4):

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Next, according to the updated order of operations, we do Prime Factor Counting operation:

The prime factors of 2 are just 2, and the prime factors of 3 are also just 3. So, they share no common prime factors. Thus, F value of 2#3=0

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Now we perform addition operation (as there is no multiplication or division):

6 @ 30

Finally, we apply concatenation. The absolute values of 6 and 30 placed side by side give us:

The given problem is 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

First, we need to handle prime factor counting:

8 # 2 = 1 (since the prime factor of 8 is 2, and it is also the prime factor of 2)
6 # 6 = 1 (because the prime factor of 6 is 2 and 3, and they are also the prime factors of 6)

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: Let's break down the solution step-wise:

Step 1: Evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F)
In the equation, 4#3 represents the count of unique prime factors common to both 4 and 3.
The prime factor of 4 is 2 and the prime factor of 3 is itself 3. So, they don't have a common prime factor.
Hence, 4#3 = 0

Operational Update: 0 + 2

Step 2: Evaluate Addition (A)
Finally, we perform the addition operation,
0 + 2 = 2

Thus, the answer to your given Mathematics problem, following the updated order of operations is:

Step 2: Solve for Prime Factor Counting (F).
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1
(since the prime factor of 2 is 2 and the prime factors of 3 is 3, there's no shared factor, hence result is 0)

Step 3: Next, solve for Multiplication/Division (none here), then Addition/Subtraction
= 6 @ 30

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: Following the Order of Operations (PEFMDASC), we perform the operations in the following sequence:

5 + 3 # 2
= 5 + 1 (Since prime factors of 3 are 3 and prime factors of 2 are 2, there are no shared factors, so 3 # 2 = 0)

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: In this expression, we have both addition and concatenation operations. Based on the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to perform addition before concatenation. 

Let's begin with the expression:

5 + 2@4 

First, perform the addition: 

5 + 2 = 7

Now the expression becomes 7@4. 

Finally, perform the concatenation operation:

7 @ 4 = 74

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: Using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we begin with the prime factor counting operation (F).

Step 1:
Evaluate 8 # 2, which calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 8 and 2.
The prime factor of 8 is 2 (since 8 = 2*2*2), and the prime factor of 2 is also 2.
Therefore, they share one prime factor (2), so 8 # 2 = 1.

Step 2: 
Evaluate 6 # 6, which calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 6 and 6.
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 6 are also 2 and 3.
They share all the prime factors 2 and 3, but the count is based on unique values, so the number of unique shared prime factors is 2.
Therefore, 6 # 6 = 2.

Now, we replace the operations in the original problem with the results from above:
1 + 2.

Finally, perform the addition:
1 + 2 = 3.

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: Let's solve this equation step by step:

We'll denote 4#3 + 2, where '#' is the Prime Factor counting operation.

According to our operations order PEFMDASC, we need to find the Prime Factor Counting prior to performing the addition.

First, we calculate 4 # 3. The prime factors of 4 are 2 (repeated twice), and the prime factors of 3 are just 3. Since there are no shared prime factors, 4 # 3 equals 0.

So our expression is now 0 + 2.

Finally, we perform the addition, 0 + 2 equals 2.

So the solution is 2.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Let's solve this expression step by step using the PEFMDASC order.

Given expression: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
First we solve the operation within parentheses, which is addition in this case because according to PEFMDASC, addition comes before concatenation.

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3 

Step 2: Prime factor counting (F)
We solve prime factor counting operation next because according to PEFMDASC, prime factor counting comes before addition and subtraction.
Prime factors of 2 are 2 and that of 3 is 3, so they share no prime factors.

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 

Step 3: Addition/Subtraction (A/S)
Now, there are only concatenation, addition and subtraction left. We do addition and subtraction first, going from left to right.

= 6 @ 18 + 12 
= 6 @ 30
= 630 

So, there is only concatenation operation left. 

The answer is 630."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: Let's solve this equation step by step:

We'll denote the Prime Factor counting operation with F for simplicity.

1) First, we need to deal with the operations within parentheses. Here, there are no parentheses, so we move to the next step.

2) There are no exponent operations in the equation, so we go to the next step.

3) Now, we have to evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operation (F). In the equation, we have 3 # 2. Here, the unique prime factors for 3 are {3} and for 2 are {2}. There are no shared prime factors, so 3 # 2 = 0.

So, the equation becomes: 5 + 0.

4) Next, there are no multiplication or division operations in the equation, so we move on to step 5.

5) Now we see addition operation. So, the equation 5 + 0 = 5.

6) Lastly, we check for any concatenation operations, but there are none, so we are done.

The answer is 5."
