= 0 + 2 (since the prime factors of 4 = 2 and prime factors of 3 = 3, there are no common factors. Therefore, 4 # 3 = 0.)
= 2
The answer is 2.","GPT Response: The prime factor of 4 is 2 and the prime factor of 3 is 3, so there is no shared prime factor. So, 4 # 3 = 0. 

Hence, the given problem is simplified as:

4 # 3 + 2 = 0 + 2 

Which is further simplified to:

0 + 2 = 2

So, ""The answer is 2.""","GPT Response: According to the new order of operations and the operation definitions provided, we start by performing the prime factor counting (#):

4 # 3 equals 0 (since 4's prime factor is 2 and 3's prime factor is 3 and there are no shared prime factors).

The expression becomes 0 + 2.

Then, we proceed with the addition:

0 + 2 equals 2.

Therefore, 

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Let's evaluate this expression step-by-step following the new order of operations PEFMDASC.

Expression: 4 # 3 + 2

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
4 # 3

The prime factor of 4 is 2, and the prime factor of 3 is 3, which means that they share no prime factors. Therefore, 4 # 3 = 0.

So, our expression now becomes:
0 + 2

Step 2: Addition (A)
Now, we carry out the addition operation:
0 + 2 = 2

gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: In solving the mathematical expression 5 + 2 @ 4 using the newly updated order of operations PEFMDASC, the operations involved here are addition (A) and concatenation operation (C). 

By using the order of operations, you must perform addition operation first before concatenation as per mentioned order.

Following the steps, 

Step 1: Perform addition operation (A)
5 + 2 = 7 

Step 2: Then, perform concatenation operation (C)
7 @ 4 = 74 

Thus, the result of the given mathematical expression 5 + 2 @ 4 is 74.

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: According to the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Parentheses (P): No parentheses in the equation.
2. Exponents (E): No exponents in the equation.
3. Prime Factor counting (F): No prime counting operation.
4. Division and Multiplication (MD): No division or multiplication.
5. Addition and Subtraction (AS): There is an addition operation, but it follows after the concatenation operation in the new order.
6. Concatenation (C): Concatenation comes first in our operation. So, we perform 2 @ 4 = 24.

Now the equation becomes: 5 + 24.

Following the addition, we solve the equation:

5 + 24 = 29

So, the answer is 29.","GPT Response: According to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we should perform addition first, then concatenation.

gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: In solving the operation 5 + 3 # 2 using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC):

Step 1: Perform the Prime Factor Counting (F)
The number 3 has one prime factor, i.e., 3 itself. The number 2 has only 1 prime factor, 2 itself. Hence, they do not share any common prime factor. So, 3 # 2 would equal to 0.

Step 2: Then the operation becomes 5 + 0 from step 1 (based on performing the Addition (A))

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: The expression is 5 + 3 # 2. 

According to the order of operations, prime factor counting should be carried out before addition. 

So, we calculate 3 # 2 first. The prime factors of 3 are {3} and 2 are {2}. There are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, hence 3 # 2 equals 0.

Substituting this back into the expression gives us 5 + 0.

Carrying out this addition operation then gives us the final result of 5.

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: According to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we should first evaluate the prime factor counting (#) operation before moving onto addition (+).

To solve 5 + 3 # 2:

First, let's find the prime factors of |3| and |2|. The prime factor of 3 is 3, and the prime factor of 2 is 2. 

Thus, 3 # 2 = 0 because 3 and 2 do not share any common prime factors.

Therefore, our expression simplifies to 5 + 0.

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: Let's evaluate this expression step-by-step following the new order of operations PEFMDASC.

Expression: 5 + 3 # 2

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Prime factors of 3 are: 3 only.
Prime factors of 2 are: 2 only.
So, 3 and 2 do not share any prime factors.

So, 3 # 2 = 0

Updated Expression: 5 + 0

Step 2: Addition (A)
5 + 0 = 5

Hence, the answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: In the given math problem, you first need to evaluate the expression within the parentheses (bracket), then perform the Prime Factor counting (# operation), then do the Subtraction, then Concatenation and finally Addition. Let's break down the problem.

Given:
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Evaluate parentheses:
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Now we perform the Prime Factor counting (since in the order PEFMDASC, F comes before A, S, and C):
Here, 2 has a prime factor of 2 and 3 has a prime factor of 3. Therefore, there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3, which gives us 0.

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0
= 6 @ 18 + 12

Next, we perform the subtraction operation (since in the order, subtraction comes before concatenation):
= 6 @ 18 + 12

Perform concatenation:
= 618 + 12

Finally, perform the addition operation:
= 630

So, the solution to the problem is 630.

Therefore, the answer is 630.","GPT Response: First we calculate the value within the parentheses.

14 + 4 = 18

So the expression becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3  

Second, we perform the Prime Factor Counting operation:

Prime factors of 2 are: 2
Prime factors of 3 are: 3
There are no common factors, thus 2#3 = 0

So the expression becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Next, perform the addition and subtraction operation (as they are of equal precedence, we solve them from left to right):

18 + 12 = 30 
So, the expression becomes:
6 @ 30 - 0

Then subtract 0 from 30:
30 - 0 = 30

So, the expression becomes:
6 @ 30

Finally, we perform concatenation operation:

6 @ 30 = 630

So the final answer is:

The answer is 630.","GPT Response: To evaluate this expression based on our new rules of operation (PEFMDASC), we'll first deal with the Parentheses:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 (parentheses come first, 14 + 4 = 18)

Next, we apply Prime Factor Counting:
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (since the only shared prime factor between 2 and 3 is 1)

Then, we handle the Addition and Subtraction from left to right:
= 6 @ 18 + 11
= 6 @ 29  (since 18 + 11 = 29)

Finally, we finish with the Concatenation operation:
= 629  (since 6 @ 29 means we merge 6 and 29)

To conclude:
The answer is 629.","GPT Response: Let's break down your problem 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 using the new order of operations PEFMDASC.
 
The first step is to deal with Parentheses:

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

The next steps in PEFMDASC are Exponents and Prime Factor Counting, but they do not appear in the problem, so we can skip it. The next operation is Multiplication and Division but they do not appear in the problem as well, so we move on to Addition and Subtraction:

= 6 @ 30 - 2 # 3

Next within ""PEFMDASC"" comes Prime Factor Counting:

= 6 @ 30 - 1
    [Since the prime factors of 2 are {2} and those of 3 are {3}; hence there are no shared prime factors and the count is 0.]

= 6 @ 29 
  [Since we calculate subtraction before concatenation, 30 - 1 results in 29.]

Finally, the last operation is the Concatenation:

= 629

Therefore, your answer is 629."
gpt-4-0613,1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: The expression is 8 # 2 + 6 # 6. 

First, we evaluate the prime factor counting operations first, since (F) comes before (A) in the order of operations (PEFMDASC).

The prime factors of 8 are 2; and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Hence, 8 and 2 share 1 prime factor (2), and so, 8 # 2 = 1.

The prime factors of 6 are 2, 3; and the prime factors of 6 (itself) are 2, 3. Hence, 6 and 6 share 2 prime factors (2 and 3), and so, 6 # 6 = 2.

Hence, the whole expression simplifies to 1 + 2.

Finally, following the order of operations (P, E, F, M/D, A/S, C), we perform addition (A). Thus, we have 1 + 2 = 3. 

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: The problem is: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6.

We begin by evaluating the prime factor counting operations # first:
(i) The prime factors of 8 are 2, and for 2 itself, the prime factor is 2. So they share the one prime factor: 2
(ii) The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3; for 6 itself, the prime factors are also 2 and 3. So they share two prime factors: 2 and 3.

So replacing the # operations in the expression with the computed values, we get 1 + 2.

Adding these together, we get 3.

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Let's solve the problem systematically,

8 # 2 + 6 # 6

= 1 + 1 (because the number of common prime factors of 8 and 2 is 1, and the number of common prime factors of 6 and 6 is also 1)

= 2

So, The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Firstly, let's start with the first operation of prime factor counting (F) according to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC). So, the first step is to find the count of unique prime factors shared between 8 and 2.

8 and 2 are both divisible by 2, which is a prime number, so they share one prime factor. Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1.

Now, we move on to the second prime factor counting operation: 6 # 6.
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and since we are comparing the same numbers, they have the exact same prime factors. Therefore, 6 # 6 = 2.

The expression now becomes 1 + 2. According to PEFMDASC, the next step is to perform the addition operation:

1 + 2 = 3

So, the answer is 3."
