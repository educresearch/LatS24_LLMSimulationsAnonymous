Firstly, we don't have any parentheses or exponents in the expression, so we move on to prime factor counting. There is no prime factor counting operation in the given expression.

Next, we move on to multiplication and division from left to right. Again, there are no multiplication or division operations.

Then, we move on to addition and subtraction from left to right. We have the addition operation 5 + 2. 

5 + 2 = 7

Finally, we move on to the concatenation operation. We have 7 @ 4.

Since concatenation joins the numbers at a digit level, 7 @ 4 is equivalent to ""74"".

Therefore, the final answer is ""The answer is 74."""

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

First, we evaluate the prime factor countings (F). 

For 8 # 2, the prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 2 are only 2. Therefore, the shared prime factors are 2, and the result of 8 # 2 is 1.

For 6 # 6, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 as well. Thus, the shared prime factors are 2 and 3, and the result of 6 # 6 is 2.

Now, we can proceed to addition (A).

Adding the result of the prime factor countings, we have 1 + 2, which equals 3.

Therefore, the final answer is 3."

Step 1: Prime factor counting
The prime factors of 5 are 5.
The prime factors of 3 are 3.
The prime factors of 2 are 2.
There are no shared prime factors between 5 and 3, or between 3 and 2.
So, 5 # 3 = 0 and 3 # 2 = 0.

Step 2: Addition
Now, we can perform the addition operation.

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

Step 1: Parentheses
We start by evaluating what is inside the parentheses. 
(14 + 4) = 18 

So the expression becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Concatenation (C)
Next, we calculate the concatenation operation.
6 @ 18 = 618

The expression now becomes:
618 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Now, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation.
2 # 3 = 0

The expression now becomes:
618 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Then, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right.
618 + 12 = 630
630 - 0 = 630

The expression now becomes:
630 - 0

Step 5: The Final Answer
Finally, we have only one operation left, which is subtraction. 
630 - 0 = 630 

Therefore, the answer is 630."

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
The absolute value of 5 is 5, and the absolute value of 3 is 3. Let's find the unique prime factors for both numbers.
- The prime factors of 5 are 5 (since 5 is a prime number, it has no other factors).
- The prime factors of 3 are 3 (since 3 is a prime number, it has no other factors).

Now, let's count the number of shared prime factors between 5 and 3. In this case, there are no shared prime factors.

Therefore, 5 # 3 = 0.

Step 2: Addition (A/S)
Now, we can perform the addition operation between 5 and the result of the prime factor counting operation.

5 + 0 = 5.

Thus, the answer is 5."
