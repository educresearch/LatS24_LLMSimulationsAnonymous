systemPrompt1_userPrompt1_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: In this problem, we have the numbers 5 and 2 with operations + and @ with 4. 

Let's remember PEFMDASC:
(P) Parentheses first
(E) Exponents
(F) Prime Factor counting
(M) Multiplication and (D) Division (Left to Right)
(A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (Left to Right)
(C) Concatenation (Left to Right)

Evaluating the given problem:
                        5 + 2@4
Following the PEFMDASC rule, we must do the addition operation before the concatenation operation, hence we will execute 5 + 2 first.

                        = 7@4
Next, we do the concatenation operation (@) where we simply join the numbers together at a digit level.

                        = 74
So, the final answer is 74.

Therefore, ""The answer is 74."""

systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: First, let's follow the PEFMDASC order and solve the expressions inside the parentheses:

14 + 4 = 18.

So we have: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Next, let's perform the prime factor counting operation (2#3):

The prime factor of 2 is 2 and the prime factors of 3 is 3. As they don't share any prime factors, the result is 0.

Now the expression is: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

We perform addition next according to PEFMDASC:

18 + 12 = 30.

So now our expression is: 6 @ 30

Finally, the concatenation operation joins 6 and 30 to give 630.

Therefore, the final answer is 630. So, ""The answer is 630."""
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

First we perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation: the prime factors of 4 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since they do not share any prime factor, 4#3 equals to 0.

Here are the steps to solve: 5 + 2@4
Under this new order of operations rule, we should perform the addition operation first and then the concatenation operation.

Step 1:
The operation is 5 + 2 before concatenation because addition comes before concatenation according to the new order of operations:

Next, concatenate 7@4 (calculated from the first step), because concatenation comes after addition according to the new order of operations:

The prime factor of 3 is 3 itself, and the prime factor of 2 is 2 itself. And since there are no shared prime factors, 3 # 2 equals 0.

Now, we perform the addition operation: 5 + 0 equals 5.

The answer is 5."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

Given expression: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

First thing to note is the Prime Factor Counting (#) comes before Addition (+). So, we calculate the Prime Factor Counting operations first:

Step 1. 8 # 2 (Prime Factor Counting)
The prime factors of 8 are 2. 
The prime factors of 2 are also 2. 
So, they share one prime factor, which is 2. Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1.

The expression becomes: 1 + 6 # 6

Step 2. 6 # 6 (Prime Factor Counting)
Since they are same numbers, they will have same prime factors. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. 
Thus, they share two prime factors. Therefore, 6 # 6 = 2.

The expression becomes: 1 + 2

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: First, we need to follow the PEFMDASC order of operations:

Step 1: Parentheses
We start by solving the operation within the parentheses.

    = 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
    = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we move onto prime factor counting operation.

    = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 
    Explanation: The prime factors of 2 are {2} and for 3 are {3}. There are no shared factors, thus 2#3 = 0.

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
After the prime factor counting operation, it's time to perform the addition and subtraction operations.

    = 6 @ 18 + 11
    Explanation: 12 - 1 = 11

Next, we follow the left-to-right rule. Hence, perform the addition operation next.

    = 6 @ 29
    Explanation: 18 + 11 = 29

Step 4: Concatenation (C)
Once we have performed all the other operations, the last step is concatenation.

    = 629
    Explanation: 6@29 corresponds to appending 29 after 6.

So, ""The answer is 629."""

systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this equation, you must follow the PEFMDASC order of operations: Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division (left-to-right), Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right), and finally Concatenation. In this case, we only deal with the Prime Factor Counting and Addition operations. 

Step 1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
Starting with 3 # 2, we need to find the common unique prime factors of 3 and 2. The prime factors of 3 are {3} and the prime factors of 2 are {2}. As no prime factor is common between 3 and 2, the result of the operation 3 # 2 is 0.

Step 2. Addition:
Now, our equation has simplified to 5 + 0 from Step 1. Adding these numbers together gives us 5.

So, the computation of the expression is as follows: 

5 + 3 # 2 
= 5+0 (from Step 1)
= 5 (from Step 2)

The answer is 5."
