systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: First, we need to perform the operation inside the parentheses:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, because of PEFMDASC order, we perform prime factor counting:

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1
(since the prime factors of |2| are 2 only, and the prime factors of |3| is 3, they share no prime factors which results in 2 # 3 = 0)

Then subtraction is done:

= 6 @ 18 + 11

Then addition will be performed:

= 6 @ 29

Finally, we perform the concatenation:

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

The Prime Factor Counting '3 # 2' means we should count the unique prime factors shared by |3| and |2|. The prime factor of 3 is 3, and the prime factor of 2 is 2. Therefore, there is no shared prime factor, hence the result of the operation '3 # 2' is 0.

We then use the Prime Factor Counting operation to find out how many unique prime factors the sets of numbers share.

8 # 2 = 1 (since the only prime factor of 2, which is 2, is also a prime factor of 8)

6 # 6 = 1 (since 6 shares all of its prime factors with itself, but considering unique ones we get 1 as result)

Starting with Prime Factor Counting :
We need to find the common prime factor(s) between 4 and 3.

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (i.e., only 1 unique prime which is 2)
The prime factors of 3 are 3.

So, there are no common primes between 4 and 3. 

Hence, 4 # 3 = 0

The problem simplifies to 0 + 2.
Now execute addition: 0 + 2 = 2.

Firstly, we perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation:

8 # 2: Both 8 and 2 share the prime factor 2, so 8 # 2 = 1

6 # 6: Prime factor of 6 is 2 and 3 and prime factor of 6 is 2 and 3, they share the same factors 2 and 3, so 6 # 6 = 2

Next, we execute the prime factor counting operation (F):

Then, we perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right:

The prime factors of 3 are 3 and prime factors of 2 are 2, so there are no shared factors between them. This makes 3 # 2 equal to 0.

Now, the problem becomes:

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)

                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

This stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction, and Concatenation. In this problem, we only have Addition and Concatenation operations.

1. The first operation to perform under PEFMDASC rule is the addition (5+2).
 
So, 5 + 2 = 7, 

Now the expression simplifies to: 7 @ 4

2. Then the next operation to perform under PEFMDASC rule is the concatenation (7 @ 4).

So, 7 @ 4 = 74

Therefore, the solution for the expression ""5 + 2 @ 4"" is 74.

So, The answer is 74."

This includes parentheses (P), exponentiation (E), prime factor counting (F), multiplication and division (M/D) from left to right, addition and subtraction (A/S) from left to right, and concatenation (C).

Step 1 - Prime Factor Counting (F):
First, execute the Prime Factor Counting operation. This is the operation represented by the # symbol. It calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of the two numbers on either side of the symbol. In this case, that's 4 # 3. 
The prime factors of 4 are {2, 2}, and the prime factors of 3 are {3}. Since they don't share any common factors, the result of 4 # 3 is 0.

Now, our expression becomes ""0 + 2"".

Step 2 - Addition (A):
Finally, execute the Addition operation. This is the operation represented by the + symbol. In this case, that's 0 + 2, which equals 2.

Step 1 (Parentheses): Evaluate the expression in the parentheses  (14 + 4)

Step 2 (Prime Factor Counting - F): Evaluate the prime factorization for (2 # 3). Both 2 and 3 are prime numbers themselves and they don't share any common factors. Therefore, 2 # 3 equals 0.
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0.

Step 3 (Addition - A): Perform addition (12+0). 
= 6 @ 18 + 12.

Step 4 (Concatenation - C): Concatenate (6@18).
= 618 + 12.

Step 5 (Addition - A): Perform the addition (618 + 12).

Step 1 - Evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F):
The first step is to evaluate this Prime Factor Counting operation, 3 # 2.
Prime factors of 3 are {3}, and prime factors of 2 are {2}. Hence, they have no shared prime factors.
So, 3 # 2 = 0.

Step 2 - Evaluate Addition (A):

5 + (3 # 2) = 5 + 0.
