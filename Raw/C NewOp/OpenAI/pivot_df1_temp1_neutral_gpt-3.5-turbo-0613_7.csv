Step 1: Parentheses
Inside the parentheses, we have 14 + 4.
So, we can rewrite the expression as: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Concatenation (C)
The first operation we encounter is concatenation, denoted as @.
So, we need to evaluate the concatenation operation.
6 @ 18 becomes 618.
Our expression now becomes: 618 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 3: Addition (A)
Next, we perform addition.
618 + 12 = 630.
Our expression becomes: 630 - 2 # 3

Step 4: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Now, we move on to prime factor counting, denoted as #.
The prime factors of 2 are {2}, and the prime factors of 3 are {3}.
Since there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3, the result of 2 # 3 is 0.
Our expression becomes: 630 - 0

Step 5: Subtraction (S)
Finally, we perform subtraction.
630 - 0 = 630.
