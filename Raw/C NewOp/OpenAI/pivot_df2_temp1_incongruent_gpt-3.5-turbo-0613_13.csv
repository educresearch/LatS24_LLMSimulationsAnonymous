gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations, we follow these steps:

1. Evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F) between 4 and 3:
   4 # 3 = 0
   (since the prime factors of 4 are 2 and the prime factors of 3 are 3, and there are no shared prime factors)

2. Perform the addition operation (A) between the result of step 1 and 2:
   0 + 2 = 2

Therefore, the final answer is 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations: PEFMDASC.

Given the expression 4#3 + 2, we start by evaluating the prime factor counting operation:
4#3 = 1 (since the prime factors of 4 are {2} and the prime factors of 3 are {3}, and there is 1 shared prime factor)

Next, we perform addition:
1 + 2 = 3

Therefore, the final answer is 3.","GPT Response: First, we need to perform the prime factor counting (F) operation between 4 and 3:

4 # 3 = 0 (since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3)

Next, we perform the addition operation (A) between the result of the prime factor counting operation (0) and 2:

0 + 2 = 2

Therefore, the final answer is 2.
The answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve this expression using the new operations and the revised order of operations (PEFMDASC), let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation (#). In this case, we need to find the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 4 and 3. 

   The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (2^2), and the prime factors of 3 are only 3. 
   Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, the result of the prime factor counting operation (#) is 0.

   So, the expression becomes: 
   0 + 2

2. Now, we can perform the addition. 
   Adding 0 and 2 gives us 2.

   So, the expression simplifies to:
   2.
