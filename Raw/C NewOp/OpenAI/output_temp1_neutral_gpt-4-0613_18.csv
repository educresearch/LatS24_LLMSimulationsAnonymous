                    Two new operations were defined:

                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.

                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)

                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: First, let's solve the operation inside the parentheses.

14 + 4 = 18

Now, we substitute it to the original operation:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Then, we conduct the Prime Factor Counting operation:

The prime factors of 2 are 2, and prime factors of 3 are 3. They do not share any prime factor. So their # operation will equals 0.

Therefore, the operation is simplified to:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Then, according to the PEFMDASC rule, we need to perform the addition operation before concatenation:

18 + 12 = 30

Substitute it back to the operation, the operation is simplified to:

6 @ 30

Finally, perform the Concatenation operation:

6 @ 30 = 630

So, the answer to this Mathematics problem is:

The answer is 630."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

First, let's evaluate Prime Factor Counting operation:

The prime factors of 4 are 2, while those of 3 are only 3, hence the operation 4 # 3 yields 0 since 2 and 3 have no shared prime factor.

So, the simplified expression becomes 0 + 2.

Finally, addition operation:

0 + 2 = 2

Therefore, the answer to the problem 4 # 3 + 2 is 2.

(i) First, we apply the operation Prime Factor Counting, as it comes before Addition in the order of operations.

Prime factor of 8 is 2. And, 2 is itself a prime number. The prime factors they share is just one, which is 2. So, 8 # 2 equals 1.

Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Again, the prime factors they share is just one, i.e., 2. So, 6 # 6 equals 1 too.

The problem now becomes: 1 + 1

(ii) Then, we apply the Addition operation

1 + 1 equals 2.

Therefore, the answer is 2."

So, the prime factor of 3 is 3, and prime factor of 2 is 2. Since there are no shared prime factors, 3 # 2 = 0.

So, substituting this, we get the calculation to be 5 + 0.

This results in a final answer of 5.

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step-by-step following the PEFMDASC order of operations:

Step 1: Parentheses - The expression inside the parentheses needs to be evaluated first.

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting - The # operation is done before addition and subtraction

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 
(since prime factors of 2 are [2], and prime factors of 3 are [3], they share no prime factors, so the result of 2 # 3 is 0)

Step 3: Addition/Subtraction - Perform addition and subtraction from left to right

6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 
= 6 @ 18 + 11
= 6 @ 29 

Step 4: Concatenation - The last operation is concatenation, which joins the two numbers together as one number.

6 @ 29 
= 629

Hence:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 = 629

So, the answer is 629."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together.

                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

However, in this case, we do not have parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, or concatenation - we only have prime factor counting and addition. 

Let's first count the prime factors shared by 3 and 2. Prime factors of 3 are {3} and prime factors of 2 are {2}. There are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2. So 3 # 2 = 0.

So the new expression now is 5 + 0.
