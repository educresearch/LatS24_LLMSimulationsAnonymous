6 # 6: We need to find the count of unique prime factors that 6 and 6 share. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since both numbers are the same, they share the same prime factors, so we have 2 shared prime factors (2 and 3).

Given expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

1. (P) Parentheses first, so we evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:
   14 + 4 = 18

   Now the expression is: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. (E) Exponents: There are no exponents to evaluate.

3. (F) Prime Factor counting:
   2 # 3
   The prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since there are no shared prime factors:
   2 # 3 = 0

   Now the expression is: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

4. (M) Multiplication: There is no multiplication to perform.

5. (D) Division: There is no division to perform.

6. (A) Addition:
   18 + 12 = 30

   Now the expression is: 6 @ 30 - 0

7. (S) Subtraction: We have one subtraction to perform, but it is subtracting 0, which doesn't change the value:
   30 - 0 = 30

   Now the expression is: 6 @ 30

8. (C) Concatenation:
   6 @ 30 means we concatenate the digits of 6 and 30:
   6 @ 30 = 630

With all operations applied in the correct order, the final answer is 630.

The answer is 630."

Given expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Firstly, we need to evaluate what's inside the parentheses (P):

(14 + 4) = 18

The expression now looks like this: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F):

Since the prime factors of 2 are just 2, and the prime factors of 3 include only 3, they share no common prime factors, which means 2 # 3 = 0.

The expression now is: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Now we perform any addition (A) and subtraction (S) from left to right:

12 - 0 = 12

The expression looks like this now: 6 @ 18 + 12

The concatenation (C) comes last, and we will perform this final operation from left to right:

Firstly, we concatenate 6 and 18, which is simply placing 6 and 18 side by side since both are positive:

6 @ 18 = 618

Then we add 12 to the concatenation:

618 + 12 = 630

According to the order of operations, we are finished with all the steps and have our final answer:

Let's evaluate the problem 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 step by step:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F) for each pair:
   - For 8 # 2: 
     The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (2^3), and the prime factors of 2 are just 2.
     They share one unique prime factor, which is 2.
     So, 8 # 2 = 1.
     
   - For 6 # 6:
     The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and since both numbers are 6, they share the same prime factors.
     However, we are only counting unique prime factors, and there are two (2 and 3), not repeated.
     So, 6 # 6 = 2.
   
2. Addition (A) of the results:

Expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

1. Parentheses (P): Evaluate expressions inside parentheses first.

6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Prime Factor Counting (F): Evaluate the counting of unique prime factors between two numbers.

Since 2 and 3 have a common prime factor of 2, the prime factor counting is 1.

6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

3. Multiplication (M) and Division (D): These are not applicable here as there are no multiplication or division operations.

4. Addition (A) / Subtraction (S): These are evaluated next, going from left to right.

Here, we have two operations: addition and subtraction. We must perform them in order, but notice that the concatenation operation comes after addition but before subtraction, so we need to handle this carefully.

First, let's deal with the addition and subtraction that doesn't involve the result of concatenation:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 = 6 @ 30 - 1

5. Concatenation (C): Merging the digits of the numbers comes next.

                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

   - The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (2^3).
   - The prime factor of 2 is 2.

Given expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
First, we solve the expression inside the parentheses.
(14 + 4) = 18

The expression now looks like:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents in this expression, so we can move on to the next operation.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Now we perform the prime factor counting operation.
2 # 3 = 0 (since 2's prime factor is 2 and 3's prime factor is 3, they share no common prime factors)

The expression now looks like:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication (M) and Division (D)
There are no multiplication or division operations in this expression, so we can proceed to the next step.

Step 5: Addition (A) and Subtraction (S)
Before we do addition and subtraction, we need to consider that Concatenation (C) comes after addition and subtraction in our updated order of operations. So we perform addition and subtraction first, adding 12 and subtracting 0:
18 + 12 = 30
18 - 0 = 18

The expression now looks like:
6 @ 30

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
Finally, we join the digits of 6 and 30 together to perform concatenation.
6 @ 30 = 630

The final answer is 630."
