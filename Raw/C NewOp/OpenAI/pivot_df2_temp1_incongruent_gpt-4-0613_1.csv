gpt-4-0613,1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we will be following the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC).

Given:
4#3 + 2

First step is to calculate the prime factor count operation:
The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 and the prime factors of 3 is 3. There are no common prime factors, so 4#3 = 0.

This gives us:
0 + 2

According to the order of operations, addition is up next. Therefore, 0 + 2 = 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we should first conduct the Prime Factor Counting as per the newly updated order of operations:

4#3: The prime factor of 4 is 2. The prime factor of 3 is 3. Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, this equals 0.

Hence, the problem becomes:

0 + 2.

Finally, we perform the addition which results to:

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: The expression is ""4#3 + 2"".

According to the new order of operations, Prime Factor Counting (F) comes before Addition. 

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2. The prime factor of 3 is 3. Hence, the shared unique prime factor count is 0.

So, 4#3 = 0.

Replace ""4#3"" with 0 in the expression:

You get ""0 + 2"".

Perform the addition:

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Given the expression 4#3 + 2, we'll use the PEFMDASC order of operations to solve it step by step.

Step 1: Prime Factor counting (F)
The prime factor of 4 is 2, and the prime factor of 3 is 3. Because there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, 4 # 3 = 0.

Step 2: Addition (A)
Now, the expression 4#3 + 2 becomes 0 + 2.

So, we do the addition which is the next operation according to the order of operations.

0 + 2 = 2.

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: In this problem, there are two operations: addition and concatenation.

According to the order of operations (PEFMDASC), addition (A) comes before concatenation (C), so the addition operation must be evaluated first.

So, for the problem ""5 + 2 @ 4"", 

1. First, add 5 + 2 which equals 7  
2. Then, concatenate 7 and 4 to get 74

So, the final answer is 74.

""The answer is 74.""","GPT Response: Following the PEFMDASC order of operations:

First, we do operations in Parentheses (P), which in this case, there are none.

Next, we check for Exponents (E), and also in this case, there are none.

We also have no Prime Factor counting (F) operation in this case.

Then, we evaluate Multiplication or Division (M/D) from left to right. Again, there are none.

Now, we need to evaluate Addition and Subtraction (A/S) from left to right.

We have addition operation here: 5 + 2, which results in 7.

So equation at this step is: 7 @ 4

Finally, we solve Concatenation (C) from left to right.

The operation 7 @ 4 results in 74 as we merely combine the numbers.

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations, we should execute addition before concatenation. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

Step 1: Evaluation addition,
5 + 2 = 7.

Step 2: Evaluation the concatenation operation,
7 @ 4 = 74.

So, the solution to your Mathematics problem is 74. 

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: Given the expression 5 + 2@4 and using the PEFMDASC order, we go through the steps as follows:

Step 1: Since our expression doesn't include parentheses (P), exponents (E), prime factor counting (F), multiplication or division (M/D), or subtraction (S), we go directly to addition (A).

So, 5 + 2 = 7.

Step 2: Now, using the result from the previous step, we have an updated expression: 7@4. Here, we have the concatenation operation (C), which is the last operation in the PEFMDASC order of operations.

The Concatenation (C) will result in 7@4 = 74.

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we will follow the order of operations which is Parentheses (P), Exponents (E), Prime Factor Counting (F), Multiplication (M) and Division (D), Addition (A) and Subtraction (S), and Concatenation (C).

Let's start:

5 + 3 # 2

The Prime Factor Counting (F) operation comes before the Addition (A) in the order of operations. So, we'll need to compute the value of 3 # 2 first.

To find answer of 3 # 2, we need to find the amount of unique prime factors shared between 3 and 2. The prime factors of 3 is 3 and the prime factor of 2 is 2. There are no shared prime factors. Therefore, 3 # 2 equals 0.

Next:

5 + 0

The final calculation is quite straightforward. We'll simply add 5 to 0. Hence, the answer is 5. 

So, ""The answer is 5.""","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we should first conduct the Prime Factor Counting as per the newly updated order of operations i.e., PEFMDASC.

Firstly, we have the numbers 3 and 2. The shared unique prime factor count (F) of 3 and 2 is 0 because they don't share any prime factors. Thus, 3 # 2 = 0.

After that, the expression becomes 5 + 0. 

The final answer is 5, because when adding zero to any number, the result is the number itself.

So, the answer is 5.","GPT Response: In the expression ""5 + 3 # 2"", according to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), Prime Factor Counting (F) is performed before Addition (A). 

First, we perform the Prime Factor Counting (F):
3 # 2 = 1, since 3 and 2 are both prime and there's exactly 1 prime number that is common to either of them, itself.

So, now the expression simplifies to ""5 + 1"".

Then, we perform the Addition (A):
5 + 1 = 6.

The answer is 6.","GPT Response: Given the expression 5+3 # 2 and using the PEFMDASC order, we go through the steps as follows:

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting
3 # 2
Here we are looking for shared unique prime factors between |3| and |2|. The prime factors for 3 are just 3 itself and for 2 is 2 itself. We therefore have no shared prime factors. 
Thus, 3 # 2 = 0.

Step 2: Addition
5 + 0
This simplifies to 5.

Therefore the final answer for the expression is 5. 

So, ""The answer is 5."""
gpt-4-0613,1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: First we proceed by applying the priority order of the operations. 

The newly defined priority order is PEFMDASC. Thus, we have parentheses first. Inside the parentheses, however, we have an addition operation ""14+4"". Solving that, we have:

6 @ (18) + 12 - 2#3

Next, there are no more expressions within parentheses nor exponents to solve, so we can move to the Prime Factor Counting operation. For that, we have to find answer of ""2#3"". Since the only prime factor of 2 is 2 and of 3 is 3 and there are no shared prime factors, ""2#3"" equals 0. 

Replacing that in the equation, the expression becomes:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Next, based on the order of operations, we have to perform multiplication or division (if any), but there's none in the equation.   
So we move further to the next operation which is addition or subtraction. ""18 + 12"" = 30. 

So the expression simplifies to:

6 @ 30 - 0

Subtraction comes next. ""30 - 0"" equals 30. Therefore, the expression is now:

6 @ 30

Finally, the Concatenation operation is last. The operation ""6 @ 30"" will give result 630 as it combines the numbers 6 and 30.

Therefore, the final answer to the given mathematics problem ""6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3"" is 630.

The answer is 630.","GPT Response: According to the order of operations PEFMDASC, operations enclosed in parentheses should be done first. 

First Step:
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3
=6 @ 18 + 12 - 1  (since 2 and 3 have a common prime factor, which is 2.)

Now we will perform the remaining operations according to the order.

Second Step:
= 618 + 12 - 1 (since concatenation ""C"" is the next operation)

Third Step:
= 630 - 1 (since addition ""A"" is next in the order of operations)

Final Step:
= 629 (since subtraction ""S"" is the last)

So, the answer is 629.","GPT Response: The first step is to solve the operations in the parentheses:

6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Next, following the new operations order, we proceed with Prime Factor Counting (F):

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 
   (Since the prime factor of 2 is 2 and the prime factors of 3 are 3, and there are no shared prime factors, hence 2#3 = 0.)

Now, perform the addition:

= 6 @ 18 + 11

We now perform the concatenation (C), which is done next according to the order:

= 618 + 11

Next proceed with normal addition to get the final result:

= 629

So, the given mathematical expression equals 629. 

The answer is 629.","GPT Response: Let's solve the given expression step by step using PEFMDASC order of operations (Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction, Concatenation). 

The expression is: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

Step 1: P (Parentheses)
First, according to the PEFMDASC order, we solve what is inside the Parentheses.

So, 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3 
becomes 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: F (Prime Factor Counting)
Next, we do the Prime Factor Counting. 

The only Prime Factor Counting operation in our expression is 2 # 3.
Prime factors of 2 = 2, and prime factors of 3 = 3. There are no shared prime factors, so 2 # 3 = 0.
So, 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3
becomes 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0.

Step 3: A/S (Addition and Subtraction from left to right)
Next, according to PEFMDASC, addition and subtraction are solved from left to right.

Firstly, we perform the addition operation 6 @ 18 + 12,
which becomes 6 @ 30.

Next we perform the subtraction operation 6 @ 30 - 0,
which becomes 6 @ 30.

Step 4: C (Concatenation)
Finally, the last operation to be performed is Concatenation (C).

Thus, 6 @ 30 = 630.

In conclusion, 
The answer is 630."
gpt-4-0613,1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: According to the order of operations (PEFMDASC), we evaluate Prime Factor counting (#) before Addition (+). 

The prime factors of 8 are 2 (2*2*2) and the prime factors of 2 are 2. So the unique prime factors shared between 8 and 2 is one which is 2. Therefore,  
8 # 2 = 1.

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 and the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. So all are unique prime factors shared between 6 and 6. Therefore,  
6 # 6 = 2.

Now the expression  becomes:
1 + 2

According to the order of operations, we now do the Addition which is the final operation. Therefore,  
1 + 2 = 3

So, based on the problem and following the newly updated operations order (PEFMDASC):

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: According to the order of operations PEFMDASC, prime factor counting should be done before addition. 

First, calculate 8 # 2. The prime factors of 8 are 2, and the prime factors of 2 are also 2. They share 1 unique prime factor, so 8 # 2 = 1.

Then, calculate 6 # 6. As both the numbers are the same, they share the same prime factors - 2 and 3. However, we are only counting unique prime factors. Thus, 2 and 3 are the unique prime factors and so the count becomes 2.

Now, go back to the original expression substituting the values obtained from our prime counting operations, we get 1 + 2 = 3.

So, the answer is 3.","GPT Response: Let's evaluate this using the updated order of operations - PEFMDASC.

First step is to calculate Prime Factor Counting (F).

8 # 2 = 1 because the only unique prime factor shared by 8 and 2 is 2. 

6 # 6 = 1 because it's counting unique prime factors of 6 which are 2 and 3, and since both numbers are the same, they share the same unique prime factors.

So the equation becomes: 1 + 1

Using the order of operations, we perform Addition (A) to give us:

1 + 1 = 2.

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Let's use the updated PEFMDASC order to solve the problem.

1. First, we perform the operations involving Prime Factor counting ('F') which are before addition and subtraction.

The prime factor of 8 is 2 and the prime factor of 2 is 2. Because they share one prime factor (2), 8 # 2 equals 1.

Similarly, the prime factor of 6 is 2 and 3. Because it shares the prime factor 2 with itself, 6 # 6 equals 1. 

The problem now looks like: 
1 + 1

Afterward, we add the two values together to get our final answer as follows:

1 + 1 = 2

The answer is 2."
