1. First, we see there are no parentheses or exponents, so we move to the next step.
2. Next, we notice there is a concatenation operation (@) and an addition operation present. According to the new order of operations, we need to perform the concatenation operation before addition.

So, 2 @ 4 = 24.

Now we have: 5 + 24.

Finally, performing addition, we get:
5 + 24 = 29.

Therefore, the answer is 29."

   6 @ 18 = 618

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-1106_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

Step 1: Parentheses
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 (since we need to evaluate what's inside the parentheses first)

Step 2: Concatenation
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3
= 618 + 12 - 2 # 3 (concatenation is next in the order of operations)

Step 3: Addition
618 + 12 - 2 # 3
= 630 - 2 # 3 (evaluating addition from left to right)

Step 4: Prime Factor Counting
630 - 2 # 3
= 630 - 0 (there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3, so the result of prime factor counting is 0)

Step 5: Subtraction
630 - 0
= 630

The answer is 630."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1.
