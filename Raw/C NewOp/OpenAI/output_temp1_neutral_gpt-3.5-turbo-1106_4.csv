Now, let's apply the operations step by step:
1. There are no parentheses or exponents in the given expression.
2. The next step is to perform any prime factor counting. Since there are no prime factor counting operations, we move to the next step.
3. We then proceed with addition and subtraction from left to right. So, we perform 5 + 2 first.
   5 + 2 = 7

4. Next, we perform concatenation from left to right. Therefore, 7 @ 4 becomes 74.

First, according to the order of operations, we need to perform the prime factor counting (F) operation before addition (A) or subtraction (S).

So, we begin by calculating the prime factor counting for each pair of numbers:
8 # 2 = 1 (since 8 = 2^3 and 2 = 2, so the shared prime factor is 2)
6 # 6 = 1 (since both 6's prime factorization is 2 * 3, so the shared prime factor is 2)

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-1106_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-1106_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help with that! Let's break it down step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations.

Given expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses
First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses.
6 @ (14 + 4) = 6 @ 18

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting
Now, we need to count the shared prime factors between 6 and 18.
6 # 18 = 1 (since the shared prime factor is 2)

So far, the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 3: Concatenation
Now, we have to perform the concatenation operation.
6 @ 18 = 618

So the expression becomes: 618 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 4: Multiplication/Division
Since there are no multiplication or division operations, we move to the next step.

Step 5: Addition/Subtraction
Now, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right.
618 + 12 = 630
630 - 2 = 628

Step 6: Prime Factor Counting
Finally, we need to count the shared prime factors between 628 and 3.
628 # 3 = 0 (since there are no shared prime factors)

The answer is 628."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
