gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression ""4 # 3 + 2"", we need to follow the order of operations, which is PEFMDASC.

First, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation (#) before addition, so:
4 # 3 + 2
= 1 + 2       (since prime factors of 4 are 2, prime factors of 3 are 3, so the shared factor count is 1)

Next, we perform the addition operation:

Therefore, the answer is 3.","GPT Response: To solve the given expression ""4 # 3 + 2,"" we need to follow the updated order of operations, which is PEFMDASC.

First, we start with the prime factor counting operation (F) which counts the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 4 and 3. The only shared prime factor between 4 and 3 is 1, so 4 # 3 equals 1.

Next, we move on to addition (A) between the result of the prime factor counting operation and 2. So, 1 + 2 equals 3.

Therefore, the answer to the given expression ""4 # 3+2"" is 3.

So, the answer is 3.","GPT Response: First, we need to perform the prime factor counting (F) before any addition or subtraction.
So, 4 # 3 = 0 (since 4 has prime factors 2 and 3 has prime factor 3, which are different).

Now, we have:
0 + 2 

Next, we perform addition, as per the order of operations (PEFMDASC):
0 + 2 = 2

Given Expression: 4 # 3 + 2

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting
We start by calculating the prime factor count between 4 and 3. Since 4 has a prime factor of 2 and 3 has a prime factor of 3, they do not share any prime factors. So, 4 # 3 = 0.

Step 2: Addition
Now, we perform addition, which gives us: 0 + 2 = 2.

gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression 5 + 3 # 2, we need to follow the order of operations, which is PEFMDASC.

First, we look for any Parentheses, Exponents, or Prime Factor Counting. There are no Parentheses or Exponents, so we move to Prime Factor Counting.

The Prime Factor Counting operation (#) gives us the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.

For 3 # 2, we find that the prime factorization of 3 is 3, and the prime factorization of 2 is 2. There are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, so 3 # 2 = 0.
