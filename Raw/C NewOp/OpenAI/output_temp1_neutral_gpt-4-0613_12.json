To simplify 2 # 3, we're checking for common prime factors. The prime factor of 2 is 2, and the prime factor of 3 is 3, so they have no prime factors in common. This equals 0.\nSo our equation now is: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0\n\nStep 3 - Addition and Subtraction (A/S):\nWithin this step, we perform the operations from left to right.
