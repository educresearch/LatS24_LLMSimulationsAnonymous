5 + 2 @ 4

The question requires performing an addition operation and a concatenation operation. According to the new order of operations, addition (A) is done before concatenation (C), so we should first perform the addition operation.

5 + 2 = 7

Then, after that, the problem becomes:

7 @ 4

The ""@"" means concatenating the numbers. So, concatenate 7 and 4:

7 @ 4 = 74

So, the final answer to this problem is 74.

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we need to follow the order of operations as provided, which is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC.

Given problem is : 8#2 + 6#6

Step 1: Compute Prime Factor Counting (#)
Initially, we need to find the result for the Prime Factor Counting operation which is 8#2 and 6#6. 

The unique prime factors of 8 are 2 whereas unique prime factors of 2 are 2. Thus, they have one common unique prime factor. Hence, 8#2 equals 1.

Similarly, the unique prime factors of 6 are 2, and 3 and for 6 it is same 2,3. They share 2 unique common prime factors (2 and 3). Hence, 6#6 equals 2.

After this step, our expression becomes: 1 + 2

Step 2: Compute Addition
Now that we have only addition operation left, we need to add the results together. So 1 + 2 equals 3. 

So, the solution will be 3.

The answer is 3."

The prime factors of 4 are 2 (in 2Â²), while the prime factors of 3 are 3. Thus, they do not share any prime factors. Therefore, 4 # 3 = 0.

Substituting this in our expression, we get:
0 + 2 = 2.

So, finally,
The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: According to the order of operations PEFMDASC, Parentheses first. 14 + 4 = 18 inside the parentheses.

So, 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we apply Prime Factor Counting. Prime factors of 2 are 2 and prime factors of 3 are 3, hence there are no shared prime factors.

So, 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 

Then we apply Addition and Subtraction operations from left to right:

6 @ 18 + 12 equals 6 @ 30 

6 @ 30 - 0 equals 6 @ 30

Finally, we apply Concatenation:

6 @ 30 = 630

The answer is 630."

Prime factors of 3 are 3, and prime factors of 2 are 2. They have no shared prime factors. Hence, 3#2 = 0.

The expression now becomes

5 + 0. 

So, we need to add these two numbers, which will give us 5.

The answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: According to the new order of operations, we have to perform addition before concatenation.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: By applying the order of operations PEFMDASC:

(i) We need to execute the Prime Factor Counting (F) first. The prime factors of 8 are 2, and for 2, it's 2 as well. Therefore, 8#2 = 1.
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Therefore, 6#6 = 1.

The resultant expression would be: 1 + 1

(ii) Now, we can execute the addition (A) operation, so 1 + 1 = 2.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, order fidelity will be the key. The operations should be executed in the following sequence:

1. Parentheses  
2. Prime Factor Counting (F)
3. Multiplication and Division (M/D)
4. Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
5. Concatenation (C).

Let's evaluate this expression step-by-step:

Expression: 6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3

Step 1: Solve the operation in parentheses.
= 6@18 + 12-2  #  3

Step 2: Solve the prime factor counting operation (#).
= 6@18 + 1
   (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3, and prime factor of 3 is 3, thus they share prime factor 3)

Step 3: As there's no multiplication and division operation, so move to Addition and Subtraction (A/S). Note: Parentheses were removed as the operation within has been evaluated.
= 6@19

Step 4: Solve Concatenation (C), which is the last operation according to the order of operations.
= 619

Final answer should then be: ""The answer is 619."""
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematical problem: 5 + 3#2, order fidelity will need to be maintained per the new rules of operation. According to the new order (PEFMDASC), Prime Factor Counting comes before Addition.

3 # 2 operation needs to be computed first. The number 3 has only 1 prime factor, which is 3. The number 2 has only 1 prime factor which is 2. The prime factors 3 and 2 are different so, 3 # 2 is 0.

The original equation now simplifies to: 5 + 0

This result is straightforward; 5 + 0 equals to 5

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: First, remember that the updated order of operations is PEFMDASC, so we'll conduct the Prime Factor Counting operation first.

Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F) shared above point out that a common prime factor between two numbers has to be counted for operation F(a#b) which implies both a and b to possess the same prime number as a factor.

(i) 8 # 2:
The prime factor of 8 is 2, and the only prime factor of 2 is also 2.
So, 8#2 = 1 because 2 is the single shared prime factor.

Also,

(ii) 6 # 6:
6 has two prime factors: 2 and 3. Also, for another 6, the factors remain the same. Therefore, 6#6 = 2 because both are factors of 6.

Now substitute these results back into the original problem: 

8#2 + 6#6 now becomes 1 + 2. 

So, the answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: According to the new order of operations, Prime Factor Counting (F) comes before Addition, so you should first calculate 4 # 3, which checks for the number of common unique prime factors between 4 and 3. 

The only prime factor of 4 is 2, and 3 itself is a prime number. There are no common prime factors between 4 and 3.

So, 4 # 3 = 0.

Then, you add this to 2, so 0 + 2 = 2.

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: First, we apply parentheses in the expression:

6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3
= 6@18 + 12-2 # 3. 

Next, we need to apply the operation of Concatenation (C) as it comes after parentheses:

= 618 + 12 - 2 # 3.

The next calculation should be the Prime Factor Counting (F) since it comes before addition and subtraction:

= 618 + 12 - 1
(As 2 has only one prime factor, 2 itself, and it is also a prime factor of 3).

Finally, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:

= 630 - 1
= 629. 

Therefore, The answer is 629."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations, Prime Factor Counting (F) comes before Addition, so you should calculate 3#2 first.

The # operation calculates the number of unique prime factors shared between the two input values. 3 and 2 are both prime numbers, but they are different, so they don't share any prime factors. Therefore, 3#2 is 0.

So, replace 3#2 with 0 in the original statement: 5 + 0.

Finally, Add 5 and 0 to get 5.

The answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Let's calculate a solution for this problem step by step.

Let's first identify the prime factors in each pair of numbers in the expression. Absolute values are to be taken as we perform prime factor counting.

Prime factors of |8|: 2.
Prime factors of |2|: 2.
8#2 = 1, as they share prime factor 2.

Prime factors of |6|: 2, 3.
Another pair of numbers is 6#6, it will be 2, as there are two unique prime factors 2 and 3 in 6.

Using the revised order of operations PEFMDASC, where prime factorization should be evaluated before addition, our expression now reads as:
1 + 2.

Adding, 1 + 2 = 3.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: Let's solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
The first operation to do according to PEFMDASC is the prime factor counting (F).
The unique prime factors of 4 are 2, and the unique prime factors of 3 are 3, so they don't share any prime factor.
So, 4 # 3 = 0.

Also, notice that we proceed from left to right, meaning we've obtained a new operation 0 + 2. 

Step 2: Addition (A)
Using the obtained previous operation, we proceed with addition. 
Here we have 0 + 2 = 2.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: Let's solve this expression step by step.

We need to use the updated PEFMDASC method which implies the following order: parentheses, exponents, prime factor counting, multiplication and division (left to right), addition and subtraction (left to right), and finally concatenation (left to right).

Starting with:

> 6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3

First, Parentheses (P)

> = 6@18 + 12-2#3

Next, do Factor Counting (F):

> = 6@18 + 12-1 (since prime factors of 2 are {2} and prime factors of 3 are {3}, they share no common prime factor, hence the factor counting 2#3 equals 0)

Then, Addition and Subtraction (A/S):

> = 6@18 + 11 (subtraction is before Addition)
> = 6@29  

Finally, perform Concatenation (C):

> = 629

The steps to solve the calculation are:
1. Perform the operation inside the parentheses (14+4 = 18).
2. Perform Prime factor counting 2#3 = 0 (There are no common prime factors between 2 and 3)
3. Subtract the resolved prime factor counting from 12 (12-0 = 12).
4. Add 12 and 18 (12+18 = 30).
5. Concatenate 6 and 29 (629).

So the answer is 629."

The expression can be evaluated as follows:

Step 1: 3#2 (Prime factor counting)
The prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since there are no shared factors between 3 and 2, 3#2 = 0.

So, our equation becomes
5 + 0

Step 2: 5 + 0 (Addition)
The result of the operation of addition of 5 and 0 is 5.

So, the answer is 5."
