gpt-4-0613,1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, we need to evaluate the prime factor count (F) operation since it comes before addition (A) in the order of operations (PEFMDASC).

Prime factors of 4 are 2 , and prime factors of 3 are 3. Hence there are no common prime factors. Thus, 4 # 3 = 0.

So the equation becomes 0 + 2.

Finally, we perform the addition operation to get the result, which is 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Under the new operations,

Firstly, applying the Prime Factor Counting Operation (F):
4 # 3 denotes the number of unique prime factors shared by 4 and 3. The prime factors of 4 are 2 (and 2), and the prime factors of 3 is 3. As there are no shared prime factors, 4 # 3 = 0.

So the expression becomes 0 + 2.

Next applying the addition operation (A):
0 + 2 = 2.

Hence, the answer to the problem 4 # 3 + 2 with the new order of operations is 2.

""The answer is 2.""","GPT Response: First, we must look at the new operation Prime Factor Counting (F) denoted by 4 # 3. 

The prime factor for 4 is 2 and the prime factor for 3 is 3. So, there are no common factors between 4 and 3. Therefore, 4 # 3 = 0. 

Following the order of operations (PEFMDASC), we should perform the Prime Factor Counting operation before addition. 

So your equation becomes: 

4 # 3 + 2 = 0 + 2 = 2. So the final step is to provide the answer in the required format. 

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Let's workout this problem step by step using the newly revised order of operations, PEFMDASC.

gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: We apply the rules of the new order of operations (PEFMDASC)

First, evaluate the addition operation: 5 + 2 = 7
Next, the concatenation operation: 7 @ 4 = 74

The final will be:

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: Under the new rules, the addition operation is performed before the concatenation operation. 

First, we have:
5 + 2 = 7

Then, using the result from the addition operation, we apply the concatenation operation by appending 4 to the result of the addition:
7 @ 4 = 74 

The final answer is 74.","GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), you would perform the operations in this order: Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), and finally Concatenation (from left to right).

In the expression 5 + 2 @ 4, there are two operations: addition and concatenation.

You would perform the addition operation first, and then the concatenation operation.

Notice that 2 @ 4 is the concatenation of numbers 2 and 4 which gives 24, and when we compute 5 + 24, the result is 29.

So,

5 + 2 @ 4 = 5 + 24 = 29 

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: Let's workout this problem step by step using the newly revised order of operations, PEFMDASC.

Given expression: 5 + 2 @ 4

According to the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we don't have to evaluate parentheses (P), exponents (E), or prime factor counting (F). 

So, we move on to M/D: Multiplication and Division, of which we have none.

Next, we go to A/S: Addition and Subtraction. In the given expression, we have an addition operation: 5 + 2 = 7. 

So the expression becomes: 7 @ 4

Finally, we do the last operation, C: Concatenation, which joins the digits of 7 and 4 together. 

7 @ 4 = 74

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: We apply the new order of operations PEFMDASC to solve the given mathematics problem:

Given, 5 + 3 # 2 

First, apply the Prime Factor Counting operation:

Observe that 2 is the only prime factor of 2 and 3 does not have any prime factors (as it's a prime number). Hence, they do not share any prime factors.

So, 3 # 2 = 0

Substituting this result back into the equation, we get:

5 + 0

Now we proceed with the Addition operation:

5 + 0 = 5

So the solution to the given mathematics problem with the newly defined operations and new order of operations is 5.

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: Under the new rules, prime factorization (#) is evaluated before addition or subtraction, so we evaluate 3 # 2 first.

The prime factors of 3 are just 3, and the prime factors of 2 are just 2. They share no common factors, so 3 # 2 = 0.

The expression simplifies to 5 + 0 = 5.

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: First, we must look at the new operation and find the number of unique prime factors that are common between 3 and 2. 

Observe that:

Prime factors of 3: 3
Prime factors of 2: 2 

There are no common prime factors between 3 and 2.

Hence, 3 # 2 = 0. 

So, the expression becomes 5 + 0.

Lastly, following the normal rules of addition:

5 + 0 = 5

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: Let's workout this problem step-by-step using the newly revised order of operations, PEFMDASC.

Given expression: 5 + 3 # 2

According to the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we know that prime factor counting (F) takes precedence over addition (A), so we perform the operation 3 # 2 first.

To do this, we need to calculate the count of unique prime factors shared between |3| and |2|. 

The prime factor of 3 is 3, and the prime factor of 2 is 2, and hence they do not share any common prime factors. Therefore, 3 # 2 = 0.

Now our expression becomes: 5 + 0

After that, according to PEFMDASC, the addition operation is next. So,
5 + 0 = 5.

gpt-4-0613,1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: The problem is:
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

First, we evaluate the part in parenthesis (Because Parentheses comes first in order operations)
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we follow the order of operations to perform the prime factor counting operation before addition or subtraction:
Since 2 and 3 both have one prime factor which is 2 in common
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

Next, considering the order of operations, we do the addition before concatenation:
= 6 @ 30 - 1

We then perform the concatenation operation:
= 630 - 1

Finally, we perform the subtraction operation:
= 629 

The answer is 629.","GPT Response: Firstly, the parentheses need to be addressed. The operation in the parentheses is addition, which results in 14 + 4 = 18.

So, the operation 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 becomes 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3.

Next, the prime factor counting is calculated: 2 # 3 = 0, as 2 and 3 are both prime numbers but they do not share any prime factors.

Thus, the equation is now 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0.

Then, the concatenation is performed: 6 @ 18 = 618.

Therefore, the equation becomes 618 + 12 - 0.

Then, follow the standard order of operations: addition before subtraction. First, add 618 and 12 to get 630.

So, the equation becomes 630 - 0.

Lastly, subtract 0 from 630, which results in 630.

So, the answer is 630.","GPT Response: To solve this equation, we need to follow the new order of operations PEFMDASC correctly.

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
The equation becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
The equation becomes: 
6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (since prime factors of 2 are 2 and prime factor of 3 is also 2, meaning they share one common prime factor.)

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Do addition and subtraction from left to right:
First, add 18 and 12: 
6 @ 30 - 1 
Then, subtract 1 from 30: 
6 @ 29

Step 4: Concatenation (C)
Finally, concatenate 6 and 29: 
629 

So, the full step-by-step calculation is: 
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1
= 6 @ 30 - 1
= 6 @ 29
= 629

The answer is 629.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to use the revised order of operations PEFMDASC.

Step 1: Parentheses
The first term that needs to be resolved is within the parenthesis: (14 + 4)
14 + 4 = 18

So the expression after this step becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting
The next operation to be performed according to PEFMDASC is prime factor counting: 2 # 3
2 and 3 are both prime numbers but they are not the same number. Hence, they don't share any common prime factors. So, 2 # 3 = 0 

Now our expression looks like: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction
According to our new order of operations, addition and subtraction should be performed next. Here we have both: 18 + 12 - 0

First we do 18 + 12 = 30 and then subtract the resultant from 0 so our operation becomes: 30 - 0 = 30

So, now our expression becomes: 6 @ 30

Step 4: Concatenation
The final operation remaining as per PEFMDASC is concatenation: 6 @ 30
Perform the operation joining the digits together.

So, 6 @ 30 = 630.

To summarize:

The solution for the expression 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3, based on the new rules, is 630. 

The answer is 630."
gpt-4-0613,1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: 8 # 2 = 1 (since 8 and 2 share a prime factor, 2)

Then apply Addition to get 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: The given problem is: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

To solve this, we need to follow the revised order of operations, PEFMDASC. 

Here, we have the F operation and the A operation in the problem. 

According to the order of operations, we carry out the Prime Factor Counting operation, F, before Addition, A.

Now, let's evaluate the problem step by step.

(i) 8 # 2 + 6 # 6
We should evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operations first (F)
Prime factor of 8 is 2 and prime factor of 2 is 2. Hence, they have 1 prime factor in common.

Prime factor of 6 are 2 and 3. Here also, there is one prime factor in common which is 2. Hence,

(ii) 1 + 1 = 2

This leads us to the desired solution.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Given the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6, we need to follow the PEFMDASC order to get the answer. 

First off, we apply the Prime Factor Counting operation on the two expressions 8 # 2 and 6 # 6.

(1) For 8 # 2:
The prime factors of 8 are 2, hence unique prime factors is 1.
The prime factor of 2 is 2.
Since they share 1 unique prime factor (2), 8 # 2 equals 1.

(2) For 6 # 6:
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, hence unique prime factors is 2, 3.
Since 6 and 6 are the same number, They share both unique prime factors (2 and 3), so 6 # 6 equals 2.

So, now our expression becomes 1 + 2.

Adding these two, we get the answer 3.

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: We begin by following the PEFMDASC order of operations:

Step 1: We calculate Prime Factor Countings (F)
- F: For the expression 8 # 2, we find the unique prime factors shared between 8 and 2. The prime factor of 8 is 2 and the prime factor of 2 is 2. They share the prime factor 2. Hence, 8 # 2 = 1. 
- F: Similarly for 6 # 6, since the numbers are the same, their prime factors are identical. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. They share both prime factors. Hence, 6 # 6 = 2.

Substituting these values back into the expression, the new expression becomes:
1 + 2

Step 2: We calculate Addition (A)
A: 1 + 2 = 3

So, the final answer is 3."
