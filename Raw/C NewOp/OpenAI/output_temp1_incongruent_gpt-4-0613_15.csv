First, compute the addition:

Firstly, apply parenthesis:

Next, continue with Prime Factor counting (F): 
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3 
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (since the prime factor of 3 and 2 is 2, so they share 1 unique prime factor, 2)

6 @ 18 + 11

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

Initial expression: 5 + 3 # 2 

First, we need to perform the Prime Factor Counting operation because, according to the new PEFMDASC convention, it takes precedence over Addition.

The prime factors of |3| are set to {3}, and the prime factors of |2| are {2}. Since they don't share any common prime factors, the result of 3 # 2 is 0.

So the expression becomes : 5 + 0

Now we proceed with the Addition operation, so 5 + 0 equals 5.

systemPrompt3_userPrompt2_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Before providing the answer, let's first break down the given problem. Based on the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

1) We have two operations in this problem: Prime Factor Counting (F) and Addition (A)
2) We calculate Prime Factor Countings first using the order of operations.

Let's compute the problem:

1) The unique prime factors of 8 are 2, since it's 2^3. 
2) The unique prime factors of 2 are 2, since it's the only prime factor.
So, 8 # 2 gives us 1 as there is 1 common prime factor.

3) The unique prime factor of 6 is 2 and 3, 
and since we are looking at 6 # 6, it's the same number, so it has the same prime factors. It gives us 2 as there are two prime factors.

Now, the new equation looks like: 1 + 2.

4) We calculate the addition, which gives 3.

Therefore, The answer is 3."

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
6. Concatenation (C) 

So, let's walk through it step by step:

1. Parentheses (P):

   First, evaluate within the parentheses.

   => 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
   => 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

2. Prime Factor Counting (F):

   Next, evaluate the prime factor count.

   In this case, we are counting the number of unique prime factors common to 2 and 3. Since 2 and 3 are both primes themselves and they are unique, the factor count is 0.

   => 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

3. Addition and Subtraction (A/S):

   Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.

   => 6 @ 18 + 12
   => 6 @ 30
   => 6@30

4. Concatenation (C):

   Now, use the concatenation operation, merging the digits of 6 and 30.

Going by the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation comes before the Addition (A) operation. Hence we should calculate 3 # 2 first.

The prime factor of 3 is 3, and the prime factor of 2 is 2. Hence, 3 # 2 is 0 as there is no shared prime factor between 3 and 2.

Now we proceed to do the addition operation, adding 5 to the result of 3 # 2.

So, 5 + 3 # 2 = 5 + 0 = 5.

The answer is 5."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:

                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0.

                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: We solve this problem following the PEFMDASC order of operations, step by step:

Step 1: Evaluate Parentheses (P)
The expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3.

Step 2: Evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F)
The shared prime factor between 2 and 3 is none. So, 2#3 = 0.
Then, the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0.

Step 3: Evaluate Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
We perform addition between 18 and 12 which becomes 30. Then subtract 0 from 30 which is still 30.
Thus, the expression becomes: 6 @ 30.

Step 4: Evaluate Concatenation (C)
Concatenate 6 and 30, which becomes 630.

Therefore, The answer is 630."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together.

                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):

We have 3 # 2. The prime factors of 3 are only 3, and the prime factors of 2 is only 2. So these two numbers do not share any prime factor. Therefore, 3 # 2 = 0.

So the equation becomes: 5 + 0.

Next we compute 5 + 0. This equals 5.
