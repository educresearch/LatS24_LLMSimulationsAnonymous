We have \[5 + 2 @ 4\]

The new order of operations requires us to handle Parentheses first (though there aren't any in this example), then Exponents (none here either), followed by Prime Factor Counting, Multiplication and Division (there are none of these), Addition and Subtraction, and finally Concatenation.

Since addition comes before concatenation in the order of operations and there are no other operations involved, we first add 5 and 2, then perform the concatenation with 4.

5 + 2 @ 4
= \(7 @ 4\) (Addition before concatenation)
= 74 (Concatenation of 7 and 4)

We have the expression:
8 # 2 + 6 # 6

First, we perform the Prime Factor Counting operation '#', then we proceed with addition.

For 8 # 2:
- The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (which is 2^3).
- The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
Since they share one unique prime factor, which is 2, the result is 1 for this part of the expression.

For 6 # 6:
- The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
- Since we're comparing 6 with itself, it shares all of its prime factors.
The prime factors shared are 2 and 3, which results in 2 because there are two unique prime factors shared.

The expression becomes:
1 + 2

                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

The expression is 5 + 3 # 2.

According to the new order:
1. (P) Parentheses 
2. (E) Exponents 
3. (F) Prime Factor counting
4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (from Left to Right)
5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (from Left to Right)

Following these rules:
- There are no parentheses or exponents to deal with.
- Next, we handle the prime factor counting operation (#).

The prime factors of 3 are 3 only since 3 is a prime number, while the prime factors of 2 are 2 only since 2 is a prime number. There are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, so:
3 # 2 = 0

First, according to the order, we have to perform any operations inside parentheses, but there are no parentheses here.

Next, we'd handle any exponents, which are also not present in this expression.

Then we'd calculate any instances of prime factor counting (F), but the expression doesn’t contain any # operator.

Following this is multiplication or division (M/D), again not applicable in this case.

After that is addition or subtraction (A/S), which we do see here. However, according to our new rules, concatenation (C) should actually be evaluated after addition, contrary to the old conventions.

Finally, we evaluate concatenation (C): \(2 @ 4\). As per the definition above, concatenation involves combining the digits of the two numbers:

1. We will first apply the Prime Factor Counting operation because it comes before addition in the order of operations.

The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (since \(8 = 2^3\)). The prime factor of 2 is 2. Since they share the prime factor 2, \(8 # 2\) is equal to 1 because there is one unique prime factor shared.

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 (since \(6 = 2 \times 3\)). Since the shared prime factor is 2 and 3, \(6 # 6\) is equal to 2 because there are two unique shared prime factors (2 and 3).

2. Now, we can replace the prime factors counting results in the expression:

So, we break down the problem as follows:

5 + 2 @ 4

Start with the addition:

= 5 + 2
= 7

Now perform the concatenation with the result of the addition and the number 4:

7 @ 4
= 74

Therefore, the final answer is 74.

The answer is 74."

1. Prime Factor Counting (F)
2. Addition (A)

Given Expression:
8 # 2 + 6 # 6

First, we find the prime factors for each number:
- Prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or 2^3).
- Prime factors of 2 are 2.
- Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.

Now we use Prime Factor Counting (F):
- 8 # 2: Since 8 and 2 share the prime factor 2, this gives us a count of 1.
- 6 # 6: All the prime factors of 6 are shared with itself, but we only count unique prime factors. The unique prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. This would mean we have 2 unique prime factors in common.

Putting it together, we now have:
1 + 2

Now, we perform the addition (A):
1 + 2 = 3

Therefore, the final answer is:

   - The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (or just 2 since we are interested in unique primes).
   - The prime factors of 3 are just 3.

Since there are no common prime factors between 4 and 3, the prime factor count is 0.

2. Addition: Now that we have solved the prime factor counting, we proceed with the addition.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
4. Multiplication (M) and Division (D) (left to right)
5. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S) (left to right)
6. Concatenation (C) (left to right)

Following these steps for the given problem:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

First, we deal with the parentheses:
6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 # 3

Then, we involve prime factor counting, but note that it will come later in this case since there is no need to apply this operation right now.

Next, we would typically do multiplication and division, but there aren't any in this problem.

Then we do the addition and subtraction. However, here we notice that the addition cannot be done right now because it is involved with a concatenation operation which comes last.

We will next perform the prime factor counting operation:
- 2 # 3
The prime factors of 2 are just 2, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3. Since they don't share any common prime factors, this operation results in 0.

So the problem becomes:
6 @ (18) + 12 - 0

Finally, we perform the concatenation operation:
6 @ 18 = 618

Now we can continue with addition and subtraction, since concatenation has been completed:
618 + 12 - 0

Adding 12:
618 + 12 = 630

Subtracting 0, which won't change the result:
630 - 0 = 630

- The prime factor of 3 is 3.
- The prime factor of 2 is 2.

Given Expression: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Step 1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
We first need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation denoted as #.

- For 8 # 2: 
  The prime factors of 8 are 2 x 2 x 2 (or \(2^3\)).
  The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
  They share the prime factor 2, so the count of unique prime factors shared is 1.

- For 6 # 6: 
  The prime factors of the first 6 are 2 x 3.
  The prime factors of the second 6 are also 2 x 3.
  They share two unique prime factors (2 and 3), so the count is 2.

Step 2. Multiplication and Division (M/D), Addition and Subtraction (A/S):
There is no multiplication or division to perform here, so we move to the addition.

Step 3. Addition (A/S):
Replace the prime factor counting results in the expression:
- Replace 8 # 2 with 1.
- Replace 6 # 6 with 2.

Revised Expression: 1 + 2

Step 4. Addition:
Now we simply add the two numbers together.

1 + 2 = 3

There is no Concatenation (C), so the final answer is 3.

1. Parentheses (P): Evaluate expressions inside parentheses first.
   Inside the parentheses, we have an addition operation:
   14 + 4 = 18

   So, the expression now becomes:
   6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Exponents (E): There are no exponents to evaluate in this expression.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F): Calculate the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values.
   Here, we have 2 # 3:
   The prime factors of 2 are just 2 itself, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3 itself. There are no shared prime factors.
   So, 2 # 3 = 0

   The expression is now:
   6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

4. Multiplication/Division (M/D): There is no multiplication or division to perform in this expression.

5. Addition/Subtraction (A/S): Perform all additions and subtractions from left to right.
   Before we do this, we need to handle the concatenation.

6. Concatenation (C): Join the digits of numbers together.
   We have 6 @ 18:
   So, 6 @ 18 = 618

   Now the expression is:
   618 + 12 - 0

   With the concatenation addressed, we can now perform the addition and subtraction:
   618 + 12 = 630
   630 - 0 = 630

Finally, after following all the steps, the expression simplifies to 630.
