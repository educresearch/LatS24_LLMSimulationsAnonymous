1. Prime Factor Counting (F): We evaluate the prime factor counting operation first before addition.

For \(8#2\), we need to find the unique prime factors of each absolute number and count the common ones.
- Prime factors of \(8\) are 2 (2 * 2 * 2).
- Prime factors of \(2\) are just 2.

Since both numbers share the prime factor 2, we have one common prime factor so \(8#2 = 1\).

For \(6#6\), we also need to find the unique prime factors and count the common ones.
- Prime factors of \(6\) are 2 and 3 (2 * 3).
- Prime factors of \(6\) are again 2 and 3.

All prime factors are shared, but since we count only unique ones, \(6#6 = 2\) because there are two unique prime factors, 2 and 3, that are shared.

2. Addition (A): Now, we just need to add the results from the prime factor counting operation.
\(1 + 2 = 3\)

Therefore, the final answer is \(3\).

systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Let's evaluate the expression step by step according to the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

Given expression: 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
We must first evaluate any expressions inside parentheses:
14 + 4 = 18

The expression now looks like this: 6@18 + 12-2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents to evaluate in this expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation:
2 # 3. Both numbers are prime, and they do not have any shared prime factors.

Therefore, 2 # 3 = 0

The expression now looks like this: 6@18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
There are no multiplication or division operations to perform here.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Now we perform the addition and the subtraction:
12 - 0 = 12

The expression, however, has an addition that comes after a concatenation operation in our list, so we cannot perform the addition yet. We need to concatenate first before performing the addition. This makes our current step just simplify to:

Expression: 6@18 + 12

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
We will now perform the concatenation operation:
6@18. Concatenating 6 and 18 results in 618.

Expression becomes: 618 + 12

Now we perform our delayed addition:
618 + 12 = 630

Since all operations have now been performed, we have the final result.

The answer is 630."

                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

1. Prime Factor counting (F): The first step is to count the number of shared unique prime factors for each pair of numbers in the prime factor counting operation (#).

- For 8#2:
The absolute values are 8 and 2, and their prime factors are:
8 = 2^3 (prime factors: 2)
2 = 2 (prime factors: 2)
They share the prime factor 2, so 8#2 = 1 (since there is only one shared prime factor).

- For 6#6:
The absolute values are 6 and 6, and their prime factors are:
6 = 2 * 3 (prime factors: 2, 3)
Since they are both 6, they share the same prime factors. Thus, there are two unique prime factors in common (2 and 3), so 6#6 = 2.

2. Addition (A): Next, we perform the addition operation with the results of the prime factor counting.

So, (8#2) + (6#6) = 1 + 2 = 3.

6@(14+4) + 12 - 2 # 3

First, we apply the parentheses (P):
6@(18) + 12 - 2 # 3

Second, we evaluate the prime factor counting (F):
Since the prime factorization of 2 is 2, and the prime factorization of 3 is 3, they do not share any prime factors.
6@(18) + 12 - 0

Third, there are no exponents (E) to evaluate.

Next, we evaluate multiplication or division (M/D), if there were any, from left to right. In this case, there's no multiplication or division to evaluate.

Now, we apply addition and subtraction (A/S) from left to right:
6@(18) + 12 becomes:
6@18 + 12 because there's no operation between 6@(18) that would take precedence before addition.

Finally, we evaluate concatenation (C), which is the last step:
6@18 is the concatenation of 6 and 18, which is 618.
So now we have:
618 + 12

Now we complete the addition:
618 + 12 = 630

Since the prime factor counting evaluates to 0 and does not affect the subsequent addition or subtraction, the final solution to the problem is:

First, we will evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F), and then we will proceed to Addition (A).

Let's evaluate 8#2:
The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2.
The prime factors of 2 are 2.
The unique prime factors common to both 8 and 2 include just the prime factor 2 (once).
Therefore, 8#2 = 1.

Now, let's evaluate 6#6:
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
Since we're examining common prime factors between the same number, all prime factors are common.
However, the prime factor counting only considers unique common prime factors (even if a prime factor appears multiple times, it is only counted once). 
Therefore, the unique prime factors common to both 6 and 6 include the factors 2 and 3.
Therefore, 6#6 = 2 (since there are two unique common prime factors: 2 and 3, counted once).

Now, we perform the addition:
1 from 8#2 added to 2 from 6#6 equals 3.

So, the solution to the problem 8#2 + 6#6 is:

8#2 + 6#6 
= 1 + 2
= 3.

The answer is 3."

6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses

We first evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:
14 + 4 = 18

The expression now is:
6@18 + 12-2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents
There are no exponents in this expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)

We evaluate 2#3:
Prime factors of 2 are 2. Prime factors of 3 are 3. There are no common prime factors, so:
2 # 3 = 0

The expression now is:
6@18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication/Division (M/D)
There is no multiplication or division to carry out.

Step 5: Addition/Subtraction (A/S)

Now we simplify the addition and subtraction from left to right:
12 - 0 = 12

The expression now is, taking into account that the addition of 12 is later in the order than the concatenation:
6@18 + 12

Step 6: Concatenation (C)

Finally, we perform the concatenation operation from left to right:
6@18 = 618

Now add 12:
618 + 12 = 630

                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

1. Evaluate any expressions within parentheses. There are none in this case.
2. Evaluate any expressions with exponents. There are none in this case.
3. Evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F). We have one instance of this with 3#2.

To evaluate 3#2, we need to find the unique prime factors of 3 and 2. Three is a prime number, and its only prime factor is 3. Two is also a prime number, and its only prime factor is 2. Since they have no shared prime factors, 3#2 equals 0.

4. Perform any multiplications and divisions from left to right. There are none in this expression.
5. Perform any additions and subtractions from left to right. We have the addition of 5 + 3#2.

Now that we know 3#2 = 0, our expression becomes:

5 + 0

This simplifies to:

5

6. Evaluate any concatenations from left to right. There are none in this expression.

So, the final answer is simply 5.

1. Parentheses (P)
First, we calculate the expression inside the parentheses (14+4):
6@(14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6@(18) + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we perform the prime factor counting operation:
2 # 3 evaluates to the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 2 and 3. The prime factors of 2 are just 2, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3. Since they share no prime factors, the result is 0.
6@(18) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6@(18) + 12 - 0

3. Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
We then do the addition and subtraction:
6@(18) + 12 - 0
= 6@(18) + 12 (Subtracting 0 doesn't change anything)

4. Concatenation (C)
Finally, we apply the concatenation operation between 6 and 18. The concatenation operation joins the digits of 6 and 18 together.
6@(18) + 12
= 618 + 12

5. Addition (A)
Perform the final addition:
618 + 12
