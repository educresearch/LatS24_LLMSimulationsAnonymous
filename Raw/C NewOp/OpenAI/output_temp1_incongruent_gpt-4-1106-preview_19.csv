Here is the breakdown of the steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting (\#): Since prime factor counting comes before addition in the order of operations, we evaluate the prime factor counting operations first.

- \( 8 \# 2 \): The prime factor of 8 is \(2^3\) (i.e., 2, 2, 2), and the prime factor of 2 is 2. They share the prime factor 2. Therefore, there is only 1 unique shared prime factor.
  \( 8 \# 2 = 1 \)

- \( 6 \# 6 \): The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Both instances of 6 share these two prime factors. However, since we are only counting the unique prime factors, it doesn't matter how many times they appear; they're counted once. 
  \( 6 \# 6 = 2 \)

2. Addition (+): After evaluating the prime factor counting, we can add the results together.

- \( 8 \# 2 = 1 \)
- \( 6 \# 6 = 2 \)
- Therefore, \( 1 + 2 = 3 \)

Following the steps outlined above, the expression evaluates to:

\( 8 \# 2 + 6 \# 6 = 1 + 2 = 3 \)

systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: First, let's go through the problem while carefully applying the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. Parentheses (P)
   Before we deal with anything else, we handle the operations inside the parentheses. So we start with the expression inside the parentheses (14 + 4).
   
   6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
   = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3
   
2. Exponents (E)
   There are no exponents in the expression.

3. Prime Factor Counting operation (F)
   Next, we handle the prime factor counting operation, which is 2 # 3 in this case.
   
   Since the prime factors of 2 are {2} and the prime factors of 3 are {3}, there is no shared prime factor, so this operation evaluates to 0.
   
   6 @ 18 + 12 - 0
   
4. Multiplication (M) and Division (D)
   There is no multiplication or division operation to perform in this expression.

5. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S)
   Now, we carry out the addition (18 + 12) and the subtraction (- 0) operations.
   
   6 @ 30 - 0
   = 6 @ 30
   Since there is nothing more to subtract (the subtraction operation resulted in - 0, which does not change the value), we move on to the next step.

6. Concatenation (C)
   Finally, we've reached the concatenation operation. We concatenate 6 and 30 since that's the only operation left.
   
   6 @ 30 = 630

Therefore, after applying all the operations in the correct order, the final expression evaluates to 630.

The answer is 630."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

8 # 2:
The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (2×2×2).
The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
Since they share the prime factor 2, the count of unique shared prime factors is 1.

6 # 6:
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
Since it is comparing the number with itself, all prime factors are shared.
Hence, the number of unique shared prime factors is 2 (the prime factors 2 and 3).

systemPrompt2_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Let's follow the revised order of operations PEFMDASC to solve the given mathematical problem:

Given expression: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

PEFMDASC stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction, and Concatenation.

Step 1: Parentheses - Evaluate expressions inside parentheses first.
In our expression, there is an addition operation inside parentheses that must be performed before concatenation:
(14 + 4) = 18

Now the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: Exponents - There are no exponents in our expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor counting - Next, we evaluate the Prime Factor counting operation #.
We have 2#3. Since the only prime factor of 2 is 2 and the only prime factor of 3 is 3, there are no shared prime factors, resulting in 0.

So, 2#3 becomes 0.

Now the expression is: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication/Division - There are no multiplication or division operations to perform here.

Step 5: Addition/ Subtraction - Since we have an addition and a subtraction operation, we perform these operations from left to right.

But before proceeding to addition, we must evaluate any concatenation operations that appear before the addition in the order of operation which includes in this case 6 @ 18. 

Concatenation - 6 @ 18 will result in placing the number 6 and 18 side by side.
So, 6 @ 18 = 618

Now the expression becomes: 618 + 12 - 0

Step 6: Continue with addition/ Subtraction - Perform addition and subtraction from left to right.
618 + 12 = 630

Given expression:
5 + 2@4

1. Parentheses (P) - There are no parentheses to evaluate.
2. Exponents (E) - There are no exponents to consider.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F) - This operation does not apply as the symbol for prime factor counting (#) is not present in the expression.
4. Multiplication/Division (M/D) - There is no multiplication or division to carry out.
5. Addition/Subtraction (A/S) - There is an addition operation present, but it must be evaluated after the Concatenation (C) according to the updated order of operations.
6. Concatenation (C) - The concatenation consists of merging digits of |a| and |b|, without considering the sign of numbers. So 2@4 will merge the digits of 2 and 4 to make 24.

Now our expression is:
5 + 24

7. Addition/Subtraction (A/S) - Finally we carry out the addition:

5 + 24 = 29

Using the updated rules, we computed the operation in the correct order, and the final answer is 29.

The answer is 29."

First, we handle the Prime Factor Counting (F) operations:

8 # 2 evaluates the unique prime factors of |8| and |2|.
The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (2^3).
The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
The shared prime factor is just 2, so the result of this operation is 1 because there is only one unique prime factor they share.

6 # 6 evaluates the unique prime factors of |6| and |6|.
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 (2 * 3).
The shared prime factors between the two numbers 6 are 2 and 3, there is only one occurrence each, so the result of this operation is 2 (for the two unique shared prime factors).

The expression given is: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
We need to calculate the values inside the parentheses first:
(14+4) = 18

The expression now looks like this:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents to evaluate in this expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Evaluate the prime factor counting operation:
2#3 = 0 (since 2 and 3 have no common prime factors)

The expression now looks like this:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication (M) and Division (D)
There are no multiplication or division operations in this expression.

Step 5: Addition (A) and Subtraction (S)
Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
Since the subtraction (12 - 0) is dependent on the addition that precedes it (6 @ 18 + 12), we will first evaluate the concatenation, which takes precedence over the addition.

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
Perform the concatenation from left to right:
6 @ 18 = 618 (by merging the digits of 6 and 18)

Now the expression looks like this:
618 + 12

Step 7: Continue Addition
Continuing with the addition, we get:
618 + 12 = 630

Since all operations have been computed following the updated order, we arrive at the final answer:

                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a@b = |a|@|b| = |12|@|-56| = 12@56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a@b = 0@24 = 024 = 24.
                    Please make sure you understand this properly; it's simple yet fundamental.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted as a#b, it counts the unique prime factors common to |a| and |b|. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.
                    It's crucial to get this right for accurate calculations.

                    C: Concatenation (left to right)
                    Your ability to adapt to these changes is vital. 
                    These aren't just theoretical concepts; they're practical tools that require your immediate attention and understanding.

Given expression:
5 + 3 # 2

According to the updated order, we must perform Prime Factor Counting (F) before proceeding with Addition (A). Therefore, we need to count the unique prime factors common to the absolute values of 3 and 2.

The prime factors of 3 are just 3 itself, and the prime factors of 2 are just 2 itself. They have no shared prime factors, resulting in:

3 # 2 = 0

Here's the breakdown:
1. Evaluate the prime factor counting (F) first: 8 # 2 and 6 # 6.

For 8 # 2:
- The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or 2^3).
- The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
- They share the prime factor 2.
- So, there's 1 unique shared prime factor.

For 6 # 6:
- The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
- Since both numbers are the same (6 and 6), they share the same prime factors 2 and 3.
- So, there are 2 unique shared prime factors.

2. Replace the # operation with the results of the prime factor counts:
8 # 2 becomes 1, and 6 # 6 becomes 2.

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
1 + 2

3. Now we do the addition (A):

1. Evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F):
We first identify the shared unique prime factors of 4 and 3. The number 4 has prime factors 2 (2*2), and the number 3 has the single prime factor 3. Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, the result of 4#3 is 0.

So we have:
