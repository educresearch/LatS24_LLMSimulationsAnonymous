1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
4. Multiplication (M) and Division (D) (from left to right)
5. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S) (from left to right)
6. Concatenation (C) (from left to right)

The problem given is: 8#2 + 6#6

Following the order:

- First, we do the prime factor counting (F) operation:

The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or 2^3). The prime factor of 2 is 2. Therefore, the prime factor they share is just 2. So, 8#2 equals to counting the number of unique prime factors shared by 8 and 2, which is just one (the prime factor 2).

For 6#6, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since the numbers are the same, the count of unique prime factors they share includes both of these primes. Thus, 6#6 equals to counting the number of unique prime factors shared by 6 and 6, which is two, the prime factors 2 and 3.

So, we have: 8#2 = 1 and 6#6 = 2.

- Then, we perform addition (A):

1 + 2 = 3

So, the final answer is: 3.

First, handle the parentheses (P):
6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3
6@18 + 12-2 # 3

Next, handle the Prime Factor counting (F):
- Since we need to evaluate the # before we can do subtraction, let's find the shared prime factors of 2 and 3.
- The prime factors of 2 are {2}, and the prime factors of 3 are {3}. They do not share any prime factors.
6@18 + 12-0

Now, evaluate the Concatenation (C):
- Concatenate 6 and 18:
6 @ 18 = 618
618 + 12-0

Finally, handle addition/subtraction (A/S) (from left to right):

                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)

                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)

First, we will handle the Prime Factor Counting (F), and then we will proceed with the Addition (A).

Here goes the step-by-step evaluation:
- \( 4 \# 3 \): The number 4 has prime factors of 2 (since \( 4 = 2^2 \)), and the number 3 has a prime factor of 3. There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so \( 4 \# 3 = 0 \).
- Now we have \( 0 + 2 \).
- Evaluating the addition, we get \( 0 + 2 = 2 \).

Putting it together, we have:

\( 4 \# 3 + 2 = 0 + 2 = 2 \).

Given expression: 6@(14+4) + 12 - 2 # 3

1. Parentheses (P): Calculate the expression within the parentheses first:
   \( 14 + 4 = 18 \)

   The expression simplifies to:
   \( 6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3 \)

2. Prime Factor Counting (F): Calculate the prime factor counting next:
   \( 2 # 3 \)

   Since 2 has 2 as its prime factor and 3 has 3 as its prime factor, they do not share any prime factor:
   \( 2 # 3 = 0 \)

   The expression simplifies to:
   \( 6@18 + 12 - 0 \)

3. Addition/Subtraction (A/S): With prime factor counting completed, we proceed with addition and subtraction from left to right:
   \( 12 - 0 = 12 \)

   The expression simplifies to:
   \( 6@18 + 12 \)

4. Concatenation (C): Finally, perform the concatenation, which is now just left to right:
   \( 6@18 \)
   
   Concatenating \( 6 \) and \( 18 \) yields \( 618 \).

   So now we are left with:
   \( 618 + 12 \)

   Adding \( 618 \) and \( 12 \) gives us:
   \( 618 + 12 = 630 \)
   
Thus, the final answer is:

1. Address Prime Factor Counting (F) first for both \(8#2\) and \(6#6\).

The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or \(2^3\)).
The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
The shared prime factor is just 2, so \(8#2 = 1\).

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
The prime factors of 6 (again) are 2 and 3.
All the prime factors are shared, but we're looking for unique prime factors only, which are 2 and 3, so \(6#6 = 2\).

2. Next, addition (A) as per the order of operations:
\[8#2 + 6#6 = 1 + 2 = 3\]

Putting it all together, you have:
\[8#2 + 6#6 = 1 + 2 = 3\]

6. Concatenation (C) left to right

The given problem is 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3. We start by solving the expression inside the parentheses:

So now we have:

6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Now we apply Prime Factor Counting:

The prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3. Since there are no common prime factors, 2 # 3 equals 0:

6@18 + 12 - 0

Since there is no multiplication or division to do, we move on to addition and subtraction:

12 - 0 = 12

Now we're left with:

Looking at the expression 5 + 2 @ 4, there is an addition and concatenation operation. According to our order of operations, addition comes before concatenation. Therefore, we don't evaluate the concatenation first.

So we evaluate it step by step:

5 + 2 @ 4
Since addition (A) comes before concatenation in our order (C), we proceed with the addition first:

7 @ 4 = 74 (since ""7"" and ""4"" are concatenated together)

1. Prime Factor Counting (F)
2. Addition (A)

Let's break it down:

1. We first address the Prime Factor Counting between 8 and 2.
   - The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or 2^3).
   - The prime factors of 2 are just 2.

Since 2 is a common prime factor, there is 1 unique shared prime factor. So, 8#2 evaluates to 1.

2. Next, we perform Prime Factor Counting between 6 and 6.
   - The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
   - Since we are comparing the same number, 6#6 should technically account for the same prime factors (2 and 3).

However, since we are looking for the count of ""unique"" prime factors shared between the two, and it is the same number (hence they share all the prime factors), we only count each prime factor once. So, 6#6 is 2, rather than 4, which would have been the case if we counted each appearance of a shared prime factor.

3. Now we have the simplified expression, which looks like this: 1 + 2.

4. Finally, we perform the addition.
   - 1 + 2 equals 3.

So the final answer is 3."

Step 1: Evaluate Prime Factor Counting (#)
The expression given is 4 # 3 + 2.

First, we need to calculate the prime factor counting for 4 and 3. 
The prime factors for 4 are 2 and 2 (or just 2 counted once uniquely), and for 3 it is just 3. Since they do not share any prime factors, the count of unique prime factors shared between them is 0.

So, 4 # 3 becomes 0.

Step 2: Evaluate Addition (+)
Now, we have the expression 0 + 2.

Adding these together, we have 0 + 2 = 2.

Step 3: There is no Concatenation to evaluate in this expression.

So the final answer is 2. 

The answer is 2."

                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)

1. Parentheses (P): First, we calculate the expression inside the parentheses.
   
   \(14 + 4 = 18\)

So the expression now becomes:

\(6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3\)

2. Exponents (E): There are no exponents to calculate in this expression.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F): Next, we perform the prime factor counting operation, which comes before multiplication/division and addition/subtraction.

   \(2 # 3\)

Since 2 and 3 are both prime and are different, there are no shared prime factors. Thus this operation yields:
   
   \(2 # 3 = 0\)

Now the expression is simplified to:

\(6 @ 18 + 12 - 0\)

4. Division (D) and Multiplication (M): There are no division or multiplication to calculate in this expression.

5. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S): We perform the addition and subtraction from left to right. However, we still need to perform the concatenation before these operations.

Now, we proceed with the concatenation (C), which is the last operation in our list:

\(6 @ 18\)

To concatenate, we join the digits of 6 and 18 together:

\(6 @ 18 = 618\)

Now, we proceed with the remaining addition and subtraction:

\(618 + 12 - 0\)

First, add 618 and 12:

\(618 + 12 = 630\)

Then subtract 0, which doesn't change the value:

\(630 - 0 = 630\)

6. Concatenation (C): We've already handled concatenation.

Putting it all together, the final simplified expression is:

\(630\)

So the answer is 630."
