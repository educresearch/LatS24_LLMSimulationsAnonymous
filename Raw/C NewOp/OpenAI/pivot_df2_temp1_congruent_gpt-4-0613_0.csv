gpt-4-0613,1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: In this problem, we have the numbers 4 and 3 involved in a prime factor counting operation and 2 which is involved in an addition operation.

According to the PEFMDASC rule, we first need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F) which comes before addition (A). 

4 # 3 means we are counting the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 4 and 3. The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 while 3 itself is a prime number. Since 4 and 3 do not share any prime factors, the value of 4 # 3 = 0.

Then we add 2 to get the final answer: 0 + 2 = 2. 

Therefore,

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: The problem is given as: 4 # 3 + 2

By following the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we start with Prime Factor Counting (F):

Prime factorization:
4: 2
3: 3

Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, the operation 4 # 3 results in 0.

So, the problem simplifies to: 0 + 2

Using Addition (A) next, we get the final answer:

0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 we first need to adhere to the order of operations PEFMDASC.

Starting with Prime Factor Counting (F): 4 # 3. 
The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factor of 3 is 3. 
Since they do not share any common prime factors, 4 # 3 = 0.

Now, substitute 4 # 3 by 0 in the expression, we get 0 + 2.

Finally, we perform the addition operation: 0 + 2 = 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve this equation, you must follow the PEFMDASC order of operations.

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
The operation is 4 # 3. The prime factor of 4 is 2 and of 3 is 3. They don't share any prime factor, so the result is 0. 

4 # 3 = 0

Step 2: Addition (A)
Now we add the result to 2.

0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: In this problem, we have the numbers 5 and 3 with operations + and #. 

Using the factor counting operation (F), 3 # 2 = 1 because the numbers 3 and 2 only have 1 same prime factor, which is 2.

So, the problem becomes 5 + 1. Evaluating that gives the result 6.

Therefore, the answer is 6.","GPT Response: The problem is given as: 5 + 3#2

First we need to evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation: 3#2. The prime factors of 3 and 2 are 3 and 2 respectively, so they have no shared prime factors. Therefore, 3#2 is equal to 0.

Replacing F operation in our given expression, we get: 5 + 0

Adding these together, we get the answer: 5

Therefore, the final answer is 5.","GPT Response: To solve this expression, we follow the PEFMDASC order of operations, where Prime Factor Counting (F) comes before Addition (A). 

First, we find 3 # 2. This operation counts the unique prime factors common to 3 and 2. The prime factors of 3 is {3} and the prime factors of 2 is {2}. These two sets don't have any shared numbers.

Therefore, 3 # 2 = 0.

The given mathematical expression becomes:

5 + 0 

Calculating the addition operation gives:

5 + 0 = 5

Step 2: Addition (A)
Add 5 and 0 together:

5 + 0 = 5

So, the answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: In this problem, we have the numbers 5, 2, and 4, and the operations + and @. The order of operations tells us to perform addition and subtraction before we do concatenation. This means we should add 5 and 2 together before we concatenate this result with 4.

So we first perform the addition:
5 + 2 = 7.

Next, we concatenate this result with 4:
7 @ 4 = 74.

So the answer to this problem is 74.

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: Using the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

First, note that there are no parentheses (P) and no exponentiations (E) present in this example. 

Next, we need to perform the Prime Factor Counting operation (F), but there are none in this case. 

Then, perform all multiplications and divisions (M/D) from left-to-right, but again there are none in this case.

Next, perform all additions and subtractions (A/S) from left-to-right:
5 + 2 = 7 

Finally, perform concatenations (C) from left-to-right: 
7 @ 4 = 74

1. In the given expression, we first have to perform the addition operation (5+2) because it is before concatenation in the order of operations (PEFMDASC). 
2. So, 5+2 equals 7.
3. Next, we concatenate 7 and 4 (7@4).
4. The outcome of 7 @ 4 equals 74 as per the rule of concatenation mentioned above.

So, The answer is 74.","GPT Response: To solve this equation, you must follow the new order of operations, PEFMDASC, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), and Concatenation (from left to right).

Here's a breakdown of the steps following the rule:

1. In the problem, 5 + 2 @ 4, we need to perform the addition operation (5 + 2) first because addition precedes concatenation in the PEFMDASC order.
2. Performing the addition, we get: 7 @ 4
3. Then, we perform the concatenation operation. Concatenation is signified by the '@' symbol and joins the two numbers together. 
4. Here, we are concatenating 7 and 4, resulting in 74.

gpt-4-0613,1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: First, evaluate what's in the parentheses:
6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3
= 6@18 + 12-2  #  3

Then, perform the operation of concatenation before addition and subtraction:
= 618 + 12-2  #  3

Then, perform the addition:
= 630-2  #  3

Then, perform the subtraction:
= 628 # 3

The operation for Prime Factor Counting is before concatenation in the order of operation. Prime factors of 628 are 2 and 157 and prime factor of 3 is 3. Therefore, they do not share any unique prime factors:

= 0

The answer is 0.","GPT Response: According to the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first do operations inside the Parentheses:

6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3
= 6@18 + 12-2 # 3

Then perform Concatenation:

= 618 + 12-2 # 3

Then perform addition and Subtraction

= 630 - 2 # 3

Then perform Prime Factor Counting:

= 630 - 1

Finally, Subtraction:

= 629

So, the final answer to the given mathematical problem is:

The answer is 629.","GPT Response: First, we need to solve the expression inside the parentheses according to the order of operations:

6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3
= 6@18 + 12-2  #  3

= 618 + 12-2  #  3

Next, we perform the subtraction operation, as it is next in line in the order of operations:

= 618 + 10 #  3

Then, we carry out the prime factor counting operation, it counts the unique prime factors common to |10| and |3|. But 10 and 3 have no common prime factors, so the result is 0:

= 6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
= 6@18 + 12 - 1
(Note: prime factors of 2 and 3 are 2 and 3 so they share one common factor)

Step 3: Addition/Subtraction

gpt-4-0613,1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: The problem given is: 

8#2 + 6#6

To solve this problem, we should first remember PEFMDASC order of operations. In this order, Prime factor counting (F) should be evaluated before Addition (A). 

First, let's evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operations: 

Prime Factor of 8 are {2}, and Prime Factor of 2 is {2}. 
So, the Prime factors shared between 8 and 2 are {2} and count is 1. 
Thus, 8#2 = 1. 

Prime Factor of 6 is {2,3}, and the Prime factors of 6 are {2,3}. 
So, the Prime factors shared between 6 and 6 are {2,3} and count is 2. 
Thus, 6#6 = 2. 

Substituting the results of Prime Factor counting into the problem, we are left with the problem 1 + 2. 

Finally, using the regular arithmetic operation of addition, the problem simplifies to:

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Using the updated order of operation, we need to evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation first.

Prime factors of 8 are 2;
Prime factors of 2 are 2;
So, 8#2 = 1 (Since there is 1 shared prime factor, which is 2)

Prime factors of 6 are 2, 3;
Prime factors of 6 (again) are 2, 3;
So, 6#6 = 2 (Since there are 2 shared prime factors, which are 2 and 3)

So, the expression becomes:
1 + 2

Which equals 3.

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: First, we compute the Prime Factor Counting (F) operations, as they are now higher precedence than addition.

For the first term, 8#2, the unique prime factors of 8 are [2] and of 2 are [2]. They have 1 prime factor in common, which is 2. So, 8#2 = 1.

For the second term, 6#6, the unique prime factors of 6 are [2, 3] and of 6 are [2, 3] again. The number of unique common factors is thus 2. So, 6#6 = 2.

Next, we do the addition operation.

The final operation we have left is addition: 1 (the result from 8#2) + 2 (the result from 6#6) equals 3.

So the final answer is 3. 
Hence, 

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: According to the PEFMDASC order of operations, this equation is solved as follows:

Step 1: Calculate the Prime Factor counting (F) operations. 

(i) First, consider 8#2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, and the prime factors of 2 are also 2. Hence, there is one common prime factor. Therefore, 8#2 = 1.

(ii) Next, consider 6#6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the same holds for the other 6 as well. Hence, here also, all prime factors are common. Hence, the number of unique shared prime factors is 2 (i.e., 2 and 3). Therefore, 6#6 = 2.

So, the equation now becomes: 1 + 2.

Step 2: Evaluate the addition (A): Now, calculate the sum as per standard arithmetic. So, 1 + 2 = 3.

Therefore, the final answer after carrying out the steps is 3.

The answer is 3."
