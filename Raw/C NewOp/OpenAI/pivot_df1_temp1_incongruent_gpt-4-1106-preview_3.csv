Since there are no parentheses, exponents, or prime factors to count in this problem, we move on to multiplication and division (MD), but none are present either.

Next comes addition and subtraction (AS), followed lastly by concatenation (C). Here, we have an addition (5 + 2) and concatenation (2 @ 4) operation.

We need to evaluate the addition before the concatenation according to the order of operations. Thus:

5 + 2@4
= 7 @ 4 (evaluate the addition first)
= 74 (then perform the concatenation)

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step, following the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

8 # 2+6 # 6

First, we must do the prime factor counting operation (F). The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or 2^3). The prime factors of 2 are just 2. So there is only 1 unique prime factor shared between 8 and 2, which is 2. Hence, 8 # 2 = 1.

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since 2 is a common factor for both 6 and itself, 6 # 6 = 1 (as it only has one prime factor shared with itself, which is 2).

Now we have:

1 + 1

Next, we perform the addition:

1 + 1 = 2

So the final answer, after completing the calculations according to the new order of operations, is:

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: According to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first perform any Prime Factor Counting (#) operations before moving onto Addition (A). Therefore, we evaluate the prime factor counting between 4 and 3 first.

The prime factors of 4 are 2 (2 x 2), and the prime factors of 3 are just 3 (3 itself, since it is a prime number). There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so the result of the prime factor counting operation is:

4 # 3 = 0

Now we can proceed with the addition operation:

0 + 2 = 2

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem according to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we must follow these steps: Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction, and lastly, Concatenation.

Given the problem:

6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

Step 1: Parentheses
Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first:

14 + 4 = 18

The expression now is:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: Exponents
There are no exponents to evaluate in this problem.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting
Evaluate the prime factor counting operation (#):

The prime factors of 2 are {2}, and the prime factors of 3 are {3}. They do not share any prime factors, so:

2#3 = 0

The expression now is:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication and Division
There are no multiplication and division operations to evaluate in this problem.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction
Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:

12 - 0 = 12

The expression now is:

6 @ 18 + 12

Step 6: Concatenation
Finally, perform the concatenation operation (@), which is done from left to right:

6 @ 18 = 618 (Concatenating 6 and 18)

Now add the result from the previous addition:

618 + 12 = 630 (Adding 12 to the concatenated number)

So the final answer to the problem is:

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
8 has prime factors of 2 (2^3) and 2 is a prime factor itself; they share a prime factor of 2.
8 # 2 = 1 (since 2 is the shared prime factor)

6 has prime factors of 2 and 3, and 6 itself has prime factors 2 and 3; they share two prime factors, 2 and 3.
6 # 6 = 2 (since 2 and 3 are the shared prime factors)

Step 2: Addition (A)

The given expression is 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3.

1. Parentheses: We first evaluate the expression inside the parentheses (14+4).
6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3 = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

2. Prime Factor Counting: Next, evaluate 2#3, which is the operation to count the number of unique prime factors shared by 2 and 3.
Prime factors of 2: {2}
Prime factors of 3: {3}
Shared prime factors: None
Therefore: 2#3 = 0
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3 = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

3. Addition and Subtraction: Proceed with the addition and subtraction from left to right.
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 = 6 @ 18 + 12
6 @ 18 + 12 = 24

- 8 # 2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (since 8 = 2^3), and the prime factors of 2 are just 2. They share the prime factor 2, so the result is 1.
- 6 # 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and since we are comparing the number with itself, all prime factors are shared. However, we need to consider unique prime factors, which are 2 and 3. Therefore, the result is 2 (since there are two unique prime factors, 2 and 3, that are shared).

Now we add the results:
8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 2 = 3

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the expression using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we proceed step by step.

The Expression: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

1. Prime Factor Counting (F)

The prime factors of 8: 2, 2, 2 (since 8 = 2 * 2 * 2)
The prime factors of 2: 2 (since 2 is a prime number)

The prime factors of 6: 2, 3 (since 6 = 2 * 3)

Now we count the unique shared prime factors:

- For 8 # 2, the shared unique prime factor is just 2 (count is 1).
- For 6 # 6, the prime factors are the same since both numbers are the same (count is 2, since 2 and 3 are the unique prime factors of 6).

2. Perform Prime Factor Counting (F)

8 # 2 = 1 (there is 1 unique shared prime factor)
6 # 6 = 2 (there are 2 unique shared prime factors since the numbers are identical)

The expression is now 1 + 2.

3. Addition (A)

Now we perform the addition of the values obtained from prime factor counting:

1 + 2 = 3

Putting it all together step by step:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6

In this expression, we have the prime factor counting operation represented by the ""#"" symbol. The expression 4#3 calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the numbers 4 and 3.

The prime factor of 4 is 2 (since 4 = 2^2), and the prime factor of 3 is 3 itself (since 3 is a prime number). There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so 4#3 equals 0.

1. Parentheses (P): First, we calculate the expression within the parentheses.
2. Exponents (E): Not applicable here, as there are no exponents in the expression.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We will calculate this after we address the parentheses.
4. Multiplication (M) and Division (D): Again, not applicable here, as there are no multiplication or division operations in the expression.
5. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S): To be handled after the parentheses.
6. Concatenation (C): To be executed last, after the addition and subtraction.

Now, let’s apply the above steps to the expression:

Expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1 - Parentheses:
(14 + 4) 
= 18

The expression now looks like this:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2 - Prime Factor Counting:
2 # 3
The prime factors of 2 are just 2, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3. No shared prime factors, so the result is 0.

The expression now is:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3 - Addition:
18 + 12
= 30

After this step, the expression is:
6 @ 30 - 0

Since there is no actual subtraction to be done (subtracting 0 has no effect), we can simplify this to:
6 @ 30

Step 4 - Concatenation:
We join the digits of 6 and 30 together:
