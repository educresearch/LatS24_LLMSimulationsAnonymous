The problem is: 4 # 3 + 2

First, we will evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operation (F) before handling addition (A):

4 # 3: The prime factors of 4 are 2 (since 4 = 2^2) and the prime factors of 3 is 3. They do not share any prime factors.

So, 4 # 3 = 0 (There are no shared prime factors.)

Now the expression simplifies to:

0 + 2

Now we perform the addition:

0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve the problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

4 # 3 + 2

First, look at Prime Factor counting (F): 
The prime factors of |4| are 2 because 4 = 2^2.
The prime factors of |3| are 3 because 3 is a prime number itself.
Since 4 and 3 do not share any prime factors, the result of 4 # 3 is 0.

It then simplifies to:
0 + 2

Now, we do the addition (A):
0 + 2 = 2

So the final answer is:
The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Let's evaluate the expression 4 # 3 + 2 according to the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): First we calculate 4 # 3, which represents the count of unique prime factors common to |4| and |3|.

The prime factors for 4 are 2 (since 4 = 2^2), and the prime factors for 3 are 3 (since 3 is itself a prime number). Thus, they share no prime factors. 

So, 4 # 3 = 0.

2. Addition (A): Now we perform the addition with the result of our Prime Factor Count.

0 + 2 = 2.

We do not need to consider the other operations (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Subtraction, Concatenation) as they are not present in this expression.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Let's solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 step by step, following the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Parentheses (P): There are no parentheses to address in this expression.
2. Exponents (E): There are no exponents to address in this expression.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We need to first determine the prime factors of 4 and 3 and see if there are any shared prime factors.
   The prime factors of 4 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. There are no shared prime factors, so the operation 4 # 3 results in 0.
   The expression now is 0 + 2.
4. Multiplication (M) / Division (D): There are no multiplication or division operations to perform.
5. Addition (A) / Subtraction (S): Now we add 0 + 2, which is equal to 2.
6. Concatenation (C): There are no concatenation operations to be performed.

The problem is: 5 + 2 @ 4

According to the new order of operations, we need to evaluate addition and concatenation. Concatenation comes after addition in the order of operations.

First, perform the addition:
5 + 2 = 7

Now, concatenate the result of the addition with 4:
7 @ 4

Since concatenation is simply putting digits next to each other, this results in:

5 + 2 @ 4

First, look for any operations within parentheses (P) and exponents (E), but there are none to address in this case.

Next, we attend to Prime Factor Counting (F), but since it's not present, we move on.

Then proceed with Multiplication (M) and Division (D), but again there are no such operations here.

Then we address Addition (A) and Subtraction (S). According to the updated order, we must perform the addition before we do the concatenation (C). So we first add 5 + 2.

5 + 2 = 7

Now that we have addressed the addition, we move on to the final operation, Concatenation (C):

7 @ 4

The concatenation of 7 and 4 results in the digits 7 and 4 being placed side by side, forming the number 74.

Therefore, the final result of the expression 5 + 2 @ 4 is 74.

   We need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses.
   14 + 4 = 18

2. (E) Exponents:
   There are no exponents to evaluate in this problem.

3. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation:
   We need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation.
   2 # 3
   The prime factors of 2 are 2, and for 3, it's 3. They do not share any prime factors.
   Thus, 2 # 3 = 0

4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (Left to Right):
   There are no multiplication or division operations to perform.

5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (Left to Right):
   Perform addition and subtraction in the order they appear, but after evaluating the prime factor counting and concatenation operations.

The answer is 630.","GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step, using the revised order of operations PEFMDASC.

The original expression is:
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses
First, we evaluate expressions within parentheses.
(14 + 4) = 18  
So, the expression simplifies to:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Now, let's evaluate the prime factor counting between 2 and 3.
2 # 3 = 0     (since there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3)
The expression becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3: Concatenation (C)
We perform the concatenation next, as there are no exponents, multiplication, division, addition, or subtraction left to perform before it.
6 @ 18 = 618
The expression simplifies further to:
618 + 12 - 0

The given expression is: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Let's solve this step by step:

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
Calculate the expression inside the parentheses first.
(14 + 4) = 18

The expression now looks like this:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
We evaluate any prime factor counting next.
The prime factors for 2 are {2} and for 3 are {3}, with no shared prime factors. Hence, 2 # 3 = 0.

The expression now looks like this:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

14 + 4 = 18

Now we have:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents in this expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we address the prime factor counting operation 2 # 3.

The prime factors of 2 are 2 and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since they do not share any prime factors, the result of the prime factor counting is 0.

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Perform the addition part first:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Here's how we proceed:

1. (F) Prime Factor counting: We need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation first since it comes before addition in the order of operations.

- 8 # 2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or just 2 since we are considering unique prime factors) and the prime factors of 2 is just 2. Since both have the prime factor 2 in common, the result of this operation is 1.
  
- 6 # 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since we are comparing 6 with itself, it shares all of its prime factors with itself, so the result of this operation is 2 (since 2 and 3 are two distinct prime factors).

2. (A) Addition: Now that we have the results of the prime factor counting, we perform the addition operation.

- 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 2

3. Adding the results together:

- 1 + 2 = 3

Thus, the final answer to the problem is 3.

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: To solve the given mathematical problem using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we will start with the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation because it comes before addition (A) in the order.

The problem is: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

First, we calculate 8 # 2:

The absolute value of 8 is 8, and its prime factors are 2, 2, 2 (which is \(2^3\)).
The absolute value of 2 is 2, and its prime factor is 2.

Both numbers share the prime factor 2, but since we're only counting unique prime factors, the count is 1.

So, 8 # 2 = 1

Next, we calculate 6 # 6:

The absolute value of 6 is 6, and its prime factors are 2 and 3.
Since both numbers are the same (6), the prime factors are also the same: 2 and 3.

The shared unique prime factors are 2 and 3.

So, 6 # 6 = 2

Now we add the results of the Prime Factor Counting:

1 + 2 = 3

Hence, the final answer to the problem is:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Let's solve the given mathematical problem using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC.

Given expression: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

First, we need to perform Prime Factor Counting (F):

8 # 2:
The prime factors of 8 are 2 x 2 x 2 (or 2^3).
The prime factors of 2 are 2.
The prime factors that 8 and 2 have in common are just one single factor of 2.
So, 8 # 2 = 1

6 # 6:
The prime factors of 6 are 2 x 3.
The prime factors of 6 are, again, 2 x 3.
The unique common prime factors between the two 6's are 2 and 3.
So, 6 # 6 = 2

Now we substitute the results back into the expression:
1 + 2

Then, we perform the Addition (A):

1 + 2 = 3

6. Concatenation (C)

Given the expression: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
- We first identify the prime factors of 8, which are 2 * 2 * 2 (or 2^3).
- The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
- Since 2 is a common prime factor, the result of 8 # 2 is 1 (because only one unique prime factor is shared).

Next:
- The prime factors of 6 are 2 * 3.
- Since 6 shares the prime factor 2 with itself, the result of 6 # 6 is 1 (because one unique prime factor, 2, is shared).

Following the order of operations, we end up with: 1 + 1

Step 2: Addition (A)
- We simply add the two resulting numbers from the prime factor counting step.
- 1 + 1 equals 2.
