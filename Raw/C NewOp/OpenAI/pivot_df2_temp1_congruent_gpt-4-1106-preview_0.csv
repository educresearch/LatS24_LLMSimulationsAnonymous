4 # 3:
The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, which is basically just 2 (since it's repeated).
The prime factors of 3 are just 3.
Since they share no common prime factors, 4 # 3 is 0.

So, for 4 # 3:
The absolute values of 4 and 3 are used, which are 4 and 3, respectively.
The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
The prime factors of 3 are 3.

3. Prime Factor counting (F) - We evaluate the prime factor counting operation 3 # 2.

Let's find the prime factors of the numbers:

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: Let's follow the order of operations PEFMDASC to solve the given expression: 5 + 3#2.

According to the new order,
- P: Parentheses first
- E: Exponents
- F: Prime Factor counting
- M/D: Multiplication and Division (left to right)
- A/S: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
- C: Concatenation (left to right)

Since there are no parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction or concatenation to take care of first, we start by evaluating the prime factor counting, which is ""3#2"".

Looking at the prime factors:
- The prime factors of |3| are just 3 itself.
- The prime factors of |2| are just 2 itself.

Since there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, the operation 3#2 evaluates to 0.

Now we substitute this back into the original expression and evaluate the addition:

2. Evaluate any expressions with exponents. There are none in this case.
3. Evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F). We have one instance of this with 3#2.

To evaluate 3#2, we need to find the unique prime factors of 3 and 2. Three is a prime number, and its only prime factor is 3. Two is also a prime number, and its only prime factor is 2. Since they have no shared prime factors, 3#2 equals 0.

4. Perform any multiplications and divisions from left to right. There are none in this expression.

First, we note that there are no parentheses (P), exponents (E), or prime factor counting (F) in the given expression.

The next step would be Multiplication (M) and Division (D), but there are none present in the expression.

Following this, we perform Addition (A) and Subtraction (S), but since Concatenation (C) should be done after Addition, we must first evaluate the Concatenation operation before we can perform the Addition.

So, we perform Concatenation (C) first:

2 @ 4 = 24

Given expression: 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
We must first evaluate any expressions inside parentheses:
14 + 4 = 18

The expression now looks like this: 6@18 + 12-2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents to evaluate in this expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation:
2 # 3. Both numbers are prime, and they do not have any shared prime factors.

Therefore, 2 # 3 = 0

The expression now looks like this: 6@18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
There are no multiplication or division operations to perform here.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Now we perform the addition and the subtraction:
12 - 0 = 12

The expression, however, has an addition that comes after a concatenation operation in our list, so we cannot perform the addition yet. We need to concatenate first before performing the addition. This makes our current step just simplify to:

Expression: 6@18 + 12

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
We will now perform the concatenation operation:
6@18. Concatenating 6 and 18 results in 618.

Expression becomes: 618 + 12

Now we perform our delayed addition:
618 + 12 = 630

Since all operations have now been performed, we have the final result.

The answer is 630.","GPT Response: Let's solve the given Mathematics problem following the updated order of operations, PEFMDASC:

6@(14+4) + 12 - 2 # 3

First, we apply the parentheses (P):
6@(18) + 12 - 2 # 3

Second, we evaluate the prime factor counting (F):
Since the prime factorization of 2 is 2, and the prime factorization of 3 is 3, they do not share any prime factors.
6@(18) + 12 - 0

Third, there are no exponents (E) to evaluate.

Next, we evaluate multiplication or division (M/D), if there were any, from left to right. In this case, there's no multiplication or division to evaluate.

Now, we apply addition and subtraction (A/S) from left to right:
6@(18) + 12 becomes:
6@18 + 12 because there's no operation between 6@(18) that would take precedence before addition.

Finally, we evaluate concatenation (C), which is the last step:
6@18 is the concatenation of 6 and 18, which is 618.
So now we have:

Step 2: Exponents
There are no exponents in this expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)

2. Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we perform the prime factor counting operation:

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem \(8#2 + 6#6\) using the new operations and order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to evaluate each operation according to their priority in the list.

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): We evaluate the prime factor counting operation first before addition.

For \(8#2\), we need to find the unique prime factors of each absolute number and count the common ones.
- Prime factors of \(8\) are 2 (2 * 2 * 2).
- Prime factors of \(2\) are just 2.

Since both numbers share the prime factor 2, we have one common prime factor so \(8#2 = 1\).

For \(6#6\), we also need to find the unique prime factors and count the common ones.
- Prime factors of \(6\) are 2 and 3 (2 * 3).
- Prime factors of \(6\) are again 2 and 3.

All prime factors are shared, but since we count only unique ones, \(6#6 = 2\) because there are two unique prime factors, 2 and 3, that are shared.

2. Addition (A): Now, we just need to add the results from the prime factor counting operation.
\(1 + 2 = 3\)

Therefore, the final answer is \(3\).

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: To solve the given Mathematics problem (8#2 + 6#6) with the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, let's go through each step:

1. Prime Factor counting (F): The first step is to count the number of shared unique prime factors for each pair of numbers in the prime factor counting operation (#).

- For 8#2:
The absolute values are 8 and 2, and their prime factors are:
8 = 2^3 (prime factors: 2)
2 = 2 (prime factors: 2)
They share the prime factor 2, so 8#2 = 1 (since there is only one shared prime factor).

- For 6#6:
The absolute values are 6 and 6, and their prime factors are:
6 = 2 * 3 (prime factors: 2, 3)
Since they are both 6, they share the same prime factors. Thus, there are two unique prime factors in common (2 and 3), so 6#6 = 2.

2. Addition (A): Next, we perform the addition operation with the results of the prime factor counting.

So, (8#2) + (6#6) = 1 + 2 = 3.

The final answer after performing the operations according to the updated order of operations is:

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we apply the Updated Order of Operations: PEFMDASC.

First, we will evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F), and then we will proceed to Addition (A).

Let's evaluate 8#2:
The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2.
The prime factors of 2 are 2.
The unique prime factors common to both 8 and 2 include just the prime factor 2 (once).
Therefore, 8#2 = 1.

Now, let's evaluate 6#6:
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
Since we're examining common prime factors between the same number, all prime factors are common.
However, the prime factor counting only considers unique common prime factors (even if a prime factor appears multiple times, it is only counted once). 
Therefore, the unique prime factors common to both 6 and 6 include the factors 2 and 3.
Therefore, 6#6 = 2 (since there are two unique common prime factors: 2 and 3, counted once).

Now, we perform the addition:
1 from 8#2 added to 2 from 6#6 equals 3.

So, the solution to the problem 8#2 + 6#6 is:

8#2 + 6#6

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: To solve the given problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we start by evaluating the prime factor counting (F) operation and then proceed to addition (A):

1. Evaluate 8#2:
- Prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (2^3).
- Prime factors of 2 are 2.

Since 2 is the common prime factor between 8 and 2, the result of 8#2 is 1.

2. Evaluate 6#6:
- Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
- The second 6 has the same prime factors, 2 and 3.

Since the two prime factors (2 and 3) are shared between 6 and 6, the result of 6#6 is 2 (the count of unique shared prime factors).

3. Add the results of the two prime factor counting operations:
1 (from 8#2) + 2 (from 6#6) = 3

So, combining these steps, we have:
8#2 + 6#6
