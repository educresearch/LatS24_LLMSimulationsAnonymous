systemPrompt1_userPrompt1_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Based on the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, the problem 5 + 2 @ 4 should be solved as follows:

Firstly, it doesn't have parentheses (P), exponents (E), or prime factor counting (F).
Secondly, there is no multiplication (M) or division (D).
Thirdly, addition (A) should be done before concatenation (C). Thus, we first perform 5 + 2, which equals 7.
Then, with the result of 7, we perform concatenation with 4, i.e., 7 @ 4, which is equivalent to adding digits of 4 after 7, giving us 74.

Therefore, the solution to the problem 5 + 2 @ 4 is 74.

The answer is 74."

First we would analyze the values of the Prime Factor Counting operation ""#"", which comes second in PEFMDASC.
8 # 2 results in 1, because both numbers have a prime factor of 2.
6 # 6 results in 1, because both numbers have a prime factor of 2 and 3, but since the numbers are the same, only the unique prime factors are considered.

Step 2: Deal with Exponents (E)
There are no exponents in the equation

(Prime factors of 2 are 2 and prime factors of 3 are 3, hence shared factors are 0.)

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

Let's apply the new order of operations (PEFMDASC).

First, we'll calculate the prime factor count (operation F) which is the first operation that appears in the expression 4 # 3 + 2. The prime factors of |4| are just 2, while the prime factors of |3| are just 3. There are no shared prime factors between |4| and |3|. 

So, 4 # 3 equals 0. 

The expression becomes: 0 + 2

Then, we apply the operation of addition (A). 

0 + 2 equals 2.

So, the answer to the given problem is 2.

First, we will be carrying out the F operation, which is Prime Factor counting. 

For the first # operation, we have 8 and 2. The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 2 is 2. Then, the count of unique prime factors common to 8 and 2 is 1, so 8 # 2 = 1.

For the second # operation, we have 6 and 6. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. The number of unique prime factors common to 6 and 6 is 2 (since 6 and 6 have the same prime factors), so 6 # 6 = 2.

We replace the # operations in the expression with these results:
1 + 2 

Finally, we perform the + operation:
1 + 2 = 3

So, the final answer is 3."

We will first evaluate the prime factor counting operation as it has higher precedence (F is evaluated before A):

Prime factors of 3 are {3}, and prime factors of 2 are {2}. There is no shared prime factor, so 3 # 2 = 0.

So, the problem becomes

5 + 0 = 5.

So, the final answer is 5.

Therefore, ""The answer is 5."""

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Let's solve the given mathematical expression step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations.

The given expression is: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
Start by solving the operation within parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18
So, the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, calculate the prime factor counting: 2 # 3
The prime factors of 2 are 2, and of 3 are 3. They have no shared prime factors. So, 2 # 3 = 0.
Replace the prime factor counting with this value. The expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Now, calculate the result of addition and subtraction from left to right.
First, do the addition operation: 6 @ 18 + 12 = 6 @ 30
Then, do the subtraction operation: 6 @ 30 - 0 = 6 @ 30

Step 4: Concatenation (C)
Lastly, perform the concatenation operation: 6 @ 30 = 630

Hence, the answer to the given mathematical expression is 630."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0.

The prime factor counting operation, represented by ""#"", calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. Here a=3 and b=2.

The prime factor of 3 is 3, and the prime factor of 2 is 2. As such, there are no shared factors between 3 and 2.

So, 3 # 2 = 0
