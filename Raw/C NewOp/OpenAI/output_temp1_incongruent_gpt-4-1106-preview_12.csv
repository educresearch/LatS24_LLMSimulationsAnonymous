3. (F) Prime Factor counting: No prime factor counting to consider.
4. (M) Multiplication: No multiplication to consider.
5. (D) Division: No division to consider.
6. (A) Addition: We see there's an addition operation, but per the new order of operations, we need to verify if the concatenation operation should be performed first.
7. (S) Subtraction: No subtraction to consider.
8. (C) Concatenation: The concatenation operation needs to be performed before the addition.

We have 2 @ 4 in the given expression, and we know that @ is the concatenation operation. We need to execute this before we perform the addition with 5.

So, we perform 2 @ 4, which means we simply concatenate the digits of 2 and 4:
2 @ 4 = 24

Now that we have the result of the concatenation, we can add it to 5:
5 + 24 = 29

Following all the steps correctly and applying the new operations order, the final answer is:

The answer is 29."

8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Here's how we proceed:

1. (F) Prime Factor counting: We need to find the number of shared unique prime factors between each set of numbers before doing any addition.

- 8 # 2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or just 2 if considering unique prime factors), and the prime factor of 2 is 2. The shared unique prime factor is 2.
Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1 since there is only one shared prime factor (which is 2).

- 6 # 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and since both numbers are the same, they obviously share the same prime factors. Therefore, the unique prime factors shared are 2 and 3.
Therefore, 6 # 6 = 2 since there are two shared prime factors (2 and 3).

2. (A) Addition: Now that we have the results of the Prime Factor counting, we can add them.

So the problem becomes:
1 (result of 8 # 2) + 2 (result of 6 # 6)

Now perform the addition:
1 + 2 = 3

1. Parentheses
2. Prime Factor counting
3. Addition and Subtraction
4. Concatenation

Let's solve the given problem step by step:

1. Evaluate the expression in the parentheses:
6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

2. Perform the prime factor counting operation:
For the prime factor counting operation 2#3, the prime factors of 2 are only 2, and the prime factors of 3 are only 3. They do not share any common prime factors.
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

3. Perform the addition and subtraction operations:
= 6 @ 18 + 12
= 6 @ 18 + 12 (since there is no subtraction to perform anymore)

4. Finally, we perform the concatenation operation:
For concatenation, we join the numbers at the digit level:
= 618 + 12 (concatenating 6 and 18)

5. The last operation is the addition:
= 618 + 12
= 630

Thus, the final answer to the problem is 630.

The answer is 630."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

4#3 + 2

First, we look for any operations within parentheses (P), but there are none here.

Next, we check for exponents (E), and there are none.

Then we perform the Prime Factor Counting (F), which is 4#3.

The prime factor of 4 is 2 (since 4 = 2²), and the prime factor of 3 is 3 (since 3 is a prime number). Since they have no prime factors in common, 4#3 yields 0.

Now we have:
0 + 2

There are no multiplication (M), division (D), addition (A), subtraction (S), or concatenation (C) operations preceding the addition operation, so we can perform the addition next.

Adding 0 and 2:
0 + 2 = 2

First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses.

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Prime Factor Counting (F):
Then, we perform the prime factor counting for 2 # 3.

Since 2 and 3 have no common prime factors (2 is prime and the prime factors of 3 are itself, 3):
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

3. Concatenation (C):
Next, we perform the concatenation operation.

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D), from left to right
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S), from left to right
6. Concatenation (C), from left to right

There are no parentheses, exponents, or prime factor counting in this problem. There's also no multiplication or division. Therefore, we move on to addition and then concatenation.

Applying these rules:

The expression is 5 + 2@4, and we perform the addition operation before the concatenation.

First, we add:
5 + 2 = 7

Then, we perform the concatenation with the result and 4:
7@4

By the definition of concatenation, we merge the digits of 7 and 4:
7@4 = 74

Therefore, the final answer is ""The answer is 74."""

Now, let's apply Prime Factor Counting (F):

8 # 2 evaluates the unique prime factors common to 8 and 2. The prime factors of 8 are 2, and for 2, it's just 2. They share a prime factor of 2. Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1.

6 # 6 evaluates the unique prime factors common to 6 and 6. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since we're looking at the same number, all prime factors are shared. However, we only count each prime factor once, so 6 # 6 = 2 (since 2 and 3 are both prime factors and are both unique).

                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): First, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation, which comes after Parentheses (P) and Exponents (E) in our order.

\(8 \# 2\) counts the unique shared prime factors between 8 and 2. The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (since \(8 = 2 \times 2 \times 2\)) and the prime factors of 2 is just 2. They share a prime factor of 2. Since it's the same prime factor repeated, we still count it as 1 unique shared prime factor.

\(8 \# 2 = 1\)

Now, we look at \(6 \# 6\). The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 (since \(6 = 2 \times 3\)), and 6 compared to itself obviously has the same prime factors, so we have 2 shared prime factors.

\(6 \# 6 = 2\)

2. Addition (A): After evaluating the prime factor counting, we perform the addition. No Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, or Division operations are present to evaluate before this step.

\(1 + 2 = 3\)

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses to evaluate in this expression.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents to evaluate in this expression.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We need to count the unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 4 and 3.
