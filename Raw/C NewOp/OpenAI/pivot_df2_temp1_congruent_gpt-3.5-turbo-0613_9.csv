1. Prime Factor Counting: We calculate the unique prime factors shared by |4| and |3|. Since prime factors of 4 are 2, and prime factors of 3 are 3, there are no shared prime factors. Therefore, 4 # 3 = 0.

2. Addition: We perform the addition operation. 3 + 2 = 5.

Therefore, the final answer is 0 + 5 = 5.

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: To solve the given expression, we need to follow the revised order of operations: PEFMDASC.

First, we need to evaluate the prime factor count (F) before addition (A/S).

1. Prime factor count (F): 4 # 3
   The prime factors of 4 are 2, so the count is 1.
   The prime factors of 3 are 3, so the count is 1.
   Since there is no shared prime factor, the count is 0.

2. Addition (A/S): 0 + 2
   The sum of 0 and 2 is 2.

Therefore, the answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve the given expression using the updated order of operations, we follow the PEFMDASC sequence:

Step 1: Prime factor counting (F)
