systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-1106_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

First, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation before addition (A) as per the updated order of operations.

So, 3 # 2 = 1 (since the prime factors of 3 are 3, and the prime factors of 2 are 2, and they do not have any common prime factors).

Therefore, the expression becomes: 5 + 1.

Now, we perform the addition, which results in 6.

So the final answer is ""The answer is 6."""

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

Step 1: Parentheses
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 (we evaluate the sum inside the parentheses first)

Step 2: Concatenation
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3
= 618 + 12 - 2 # 3 (we evaluate the concatenation next)

Step 3: Addition
618 + 12 - 2 # 3
= 618 + 12 - 2 # 3 (no addition or subtraction to perform yet)

Step 4: Prime Factor Counting
618 + 12 - 2 # 3
= 618 + 12 - 0 (we evaluate the prime factor counting next)

Step 5: Addition
618 + 12 - 0

Step 6: Concatenation
618 + 12

Step 1: Evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation.
Step 2: Perform Addition (A) according to PEFMDASC order.

Let's begin with step 1, the evaluation of the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation:

Step 1:
3 # 2
Since the prime factors of 3 are 3, and the prime factors of 2 are 2, there are no shared prime factors. Therefore, 3 # 2 = 0.

Step 2:
Now, we evaluate the addition:

5 + 0
This simplifies to 5.
