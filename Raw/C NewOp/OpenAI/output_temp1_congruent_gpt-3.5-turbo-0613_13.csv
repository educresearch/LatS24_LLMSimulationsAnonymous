14 + 4 = 18

Next, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation:

12 # 2 = 1
(this is because 12 has factors 2 and 3, while 2 has only the factor 2, so they have 1 shared prime factor)

Moving on to the concatenation operation:

6@(18) = 618

618 + 12 - 1 = 629

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

First, let's evaluate the prime factor countings (F). 

For 8#2, the prime factors of 8 are 2, and the prime factors of 2 are also 2. Therefore, the shared prime factor is 2.
So, 8#2 = 2.

For 6#6, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Therefore, the shared prime factor is 2.
So, 6#6 = 2.

Now, let's evaluate the addition (A/S) using the obtained prime factor countings.

8#2 + 6#6 = 2 + 2 = 4.

Therefore, the answer is 4."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3 using the PEFMDASC order, we will follow the order of operations step by step:

Step 1: Parentheses
In this step, we need to evaluate what is inside the parentheses first.
14 + 4 = 18

The expression becomes: 6@(18) + 12-2  #  3

Step 2: Exponents (none in this expression)

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting
In this step, we need to calculate the shared prime factors between the absolute values of the numbers.
6 # 18 = 1
(since prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and prime factors of 18 are 2 and 3)

The expression becomes: 1 + 12-2  #  3

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (left to right)
There are no multiplication or division operations in this expression.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
Perform the addition and subtraction operations according to the order they appear.
1 + 12 = 13
13 - 2 = 11

The expression becomes: 11  #  3

Step 6: Concatenation (left to right)
In this step, we perform the concatenation operation.
11 @ 3 = 113

The final answer is 113."

Step 1: Prime factor counting (#)
Since the absolute value of 5 is 5 and the absolute value of 2 is 2, we need to count the number of shared prime factors between 5 and 2. Since 5 and 2 do not have any shared prime factors, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 0.

Step 2: Addition (+)
Now, we can perform the addition operation. We have 5 + 0, which equals 5.

Therefore, the answer is 5."
