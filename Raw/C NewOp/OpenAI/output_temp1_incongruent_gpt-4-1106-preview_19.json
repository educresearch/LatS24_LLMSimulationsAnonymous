Parentheses (P)\n   Before we deal with anything else, we handle the operations inside the parentheses. So we start with the expression inside the parentheses (14 + 4).\n   \n   6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3\n   = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3\n   \n2.

Multiplication (M) and Division (D)\n   There is no multiplication or division operation to perform in this expression.\n\n5. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S)\n   Now, we carry out the addition (18 + 12) and the subtraction (- 0) operations.\n   \n   6 @ 30 - 0\n   = 6 @ 30\n   Since there is nothing more to subtract (the subtraction operation resulted in - 0, which does not change the value), we move on to the next step.\n\n6. Concatenation (C)\n   Finally, we've reached the concatenation operation. We concatenate 6 and 30 since that's the only operation left.\n   \n   6 @ 30 = 630\n\nTherefore, after applying all the operations in the correct order, the final expression evaluates to 630.\n\nThe answer is 630."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400", "model": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 400, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. \n                    Two new operations were defined:\n                    1.

Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factor Counting (F):** We need to count the number of unique prime factors that 3 and 2 share. The prime factors of 3 are just 3 (since it's prime), and the prime factors of 2 are just 2 (since it's also prime).
