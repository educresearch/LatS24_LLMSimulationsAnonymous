1. Parentheses []
2. Exponents (E)
3. Prime Factor counting (#)
4. Multiplication (M) and Division (D) (from Left to Right)
5. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S) (from Left to Right)
6. Concatenation (C) (from Left to Right)

The given expression is 5 + 2 @ 4. There are no parentheses, exponents, prime factor counting or multiplication/division to deal with. So we move to addition and concatenation.

However, according to the order of operations, we perform addition before concatenation. Therefore, first, we add the numbers:

5 + 2 = 7

Then, we perform the concatenation operation:

7 @ 4 = 74 (since concatenation is joining the numbers at a digit level)

So the expression 5 + 2 @ 4 evaluates to 74.

The answer is 74."

Problem: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
We need to determine the count of unique prime factors shared between 8 and 2, as well as between 6 and 6.

The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (i.e., 2^3).
The prime factor of 2 is 2.

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
The prime factors of 6 are the same 2 and 3.

Therefore, 8 # 2 equals the count of unique shared prime factors, which is just 2 in this case.
Also, 6 # 6 equals the count of unique shared prime factors, which for 6 and 6 includes both 2 and 3. However, since we are looking for unique shared prime factors, we count the set {2, 3} once, thus 6 # 6 equals 2.

Step 2: Addition (A)
Now we simply add the results of the prime factor counting.
8 # 2 + 6 # 6
= 1 + 2
= 3

So, after evaluating according to the new order of operations, the final answer is:

systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Let's break down the given mathematics problem step by step while following the PEFMDASC order of operations:

The given expression is 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3.

First, we should solve the parentheses (P):
(14+4) = 18

The expression now looks like this: 
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Next, we should solve the Prime Factor Counting operation (F):
2#3 counts the number of unique prime factors shared between 2 and 3. Since 2 and 3 are both prime and distinct from each other, the result is 0.

The expression now looks like this:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

We proceed with the remaining operations from left to right since we don't have any Exponents (E), Multiplication (M), Division (D), Addition (A), or Subtraction (S) that would take precedence over Concatenation (C). 

First, we do the Concatenation of 6 and 18:
6 @ 18 = 618

The expression now looks like this:
618 + 12 - 0

Next, we perform the Addition operation:
618 + 12 = 630

The expression now looks like this:
630 - 0

Lastly, we perform the Subtraction operation:
630 - 0 = 630

Therefore, the final answer to the given mathematics problem is 630.

The answer is 630."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e.,

                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting

                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

Expression: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

Step 1 - Parentheses (P):
First, solve the expression within the parentheses (14+4).

6 @ (18) + 12 - 2#3

Step 2 - Prime Factor Counting (F):
Next, evaluate the prime factor counting operation 2#3.
The prime factors of 2 are just 2, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3. Since they do not share any prime factors, 2#3 equals 0.

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3 - Multiplication/Division (M/D):
There are no multiplication or division operations to perform here.

Step 4 - Addition/Subtraction (A/S):
Add and subtract in the order they appear from left to right. However, we cannot evaluate the addition or subtraction yet because we need to handle concatenation (C) first as it is earlier in the order of operations.

Step 5 - Concatenation (C):
Now, concatenate the numbers as specified by the ""@"" operation.

6 @ 18 results in the concatenation of 6 and 18:

618 + 12 - 0

Now we can proceed to addition and subtraction:

618 + 12 - 0

First, we evaluate the prime factor counting (F), which is indicated by the # operation:

8 # 2: 
8 has prime factors of 2 (2 * 2 * 2).
2 has prime factors of 2.
So there is one unique prime factor that they share, which is 2.
Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1.

6 # 6: 
6 has prime factors of 2 and 3 (2 * 3).
Since both numbers are the same, they share the same prime factors.
Therefore, 6 # 6 = 2 (since there are two prime factors: 2 and 3).

Now the expression becomes:
1 + 2

1 + 2 = 3

Given problem: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

First, we evaluate what's inside the parentheses (P):
6 @ (18) + 12 - 2#3

Next, we evaluate any exponents (E), but there are none in this problem.

Then, we look for any prime factor counting operations (F):
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 (since the prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3, there are no shared prime factors)

Now we address any multiplication and division (M/D), which in this problem there is none.

After that, we handle addition and subtraction (A/S):
We evaluate from left to right since addition and subtraction have the same precedence:

First, we add 12 (there's nothing to change here yet):
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Since there are no more operations to perform inside that operation, we can concatenate:
6 @ 18 = 618

Now adding 12:
618 + 12 = 630

Then we subtract 0 (which will not change the result):
630 - 0 = 630

Finally, we perform the concatenation (C), but there are no further concatenation operations left.

So, the final answer is 630.

5. A/S: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)

Now, we'll solve the given expression: 5 + 3 # 2

According to the updated order of operations, we perform the prime factor counting (F) before we perform addition (A).

So we look at the prime factor counting operation, which is 3 # 2.

The prime factor of 3 is 3 itself, and the prime factor of 2 is 2 itself. They share no common prime factors, so:

3 # 2 = 0

Now we can proceed with the addition:

5 + 0 = 5

Putting it all together, we get the final answer:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F)

Starting with Prime Factor Counting (F):

8 # 2: The unique prime factors of 8 are 2, and the unique prime factors of 2 are 2. Since they share the prime factor 2, the count of shared prime factors is 1.

6 # 6: For any number n, n # n would always be the number of unique prime factors of n, because all are shared with itself. However, the example given, 16 # 4 was incorrect. The correct explanation should be: Since the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, the shared prime factors of 6 and 6 include both 2 and 3. Therefore, there are 2 shared unique prime factors.

Now, we can replace the expressions with the results of the Prime Factor Counting:

1 + 2
