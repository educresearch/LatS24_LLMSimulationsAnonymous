6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (since prime factors of 2 are 2 and prime factors of 3 is 3, hence they share 0 prime factors)

Now, we perform the addition since FMDAS is left

6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

When it comes to prime factor counting (F), which is denoted as a # b, we are required to count the unique prime factors that the numbers |a| and |b| share.

(a) 8 # 2 = 1. Prime factors of 8 are 2 alone (2 cubed) and prime factor of 2 is 2, thus we have 1 shared prime factor.

(b) 6 # 6 = 1. For 6 we have prime factors 2 and 3, but both 6 share the same prime factors, in this case we have 2 shared prime factors, but we consider ULTIMATE FACTORS only, i.e., we count the prime factors that both numbers share, counting each prime factor only once. Here, the prime factors 2 and 3 are counted as 1.

Upon evaluating these expressions, we get:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6 
= 1 + 1 
= 2

Therefore, the answer is 2."

The expression is 4 # 3 + 2.

First, apply the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation. The prime factor of 4 is 2, and the prime factor for 3 is 3. Hence, they don't share any common prime factors.

So, 4 # 3 = 0.

This simplifies the expression to: 0 + 2.

systemPrompt3_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Let's solve this problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC).

The new operation here is Prime Factor Counting. Prime Factor Counting (F) is denoted as a # b, and it counts the unique prime factors common to |a| and |b|.

First, let's calculate the Prime Factor Count of 3 and 2 (3 # 2):

Prime factors of 3 are 3 (because 3 itself is prime)
Prime factors of 2 are 2 (because 2 is prime)
Since there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, the count will be 0.

So, 3 # 2 = 0

Now the original problem, 5 + 3 # 2, is simplified to 5 + 0.

We proceed with the addition operation (A), summing 5 + 0 to get 5.

So, the answer to the problem 5 + 3 # 2 is 5.

""The answer is 5."""

Since 8 and 2 have same prime factor 2, 8 # 2 = 1 (One common prime number)
Since 6's prime factors are 2 and 3, and as it is the same number we are just counting the unique prime factors of 6 = 2, 3, thus 6 # 6 = 2 (Two unique prime numbers)

                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,user,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: In the given problem, we have the equation 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3. We will solve this step-by-step following the PEFMDASC order.

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
We first deal with the parentheses and calculate the value of the expression inside parentheses. 
(14 + 4) = 18

So, the equation becomes: 
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents in the problem, so we can skip this step.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we perform the counting of shared prime factors between 2 and 3. 
The prime factors of 2 is 2, and the prime factors of 3 is 3. As 2 and 3 are both prime numbers, they don't share any prime factors. 

So, 2 # 3 = 0

Our equation now is: 
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
There are no multiplication or division operations in this problem, so we can skip this step.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
We perform addition and subtraction from left to right.

So, first, we calculate: 
18 + 12 = 30

The equation now becomes: 
6 @ 30 - 0

Next, subtracting 0 from 30 does not affect the number, hence we ignore it. So, the equation now is: 
6 @ 30

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
The final operation left is the concatenation operation (@): 

6 @ 30 = 630

So, the final answer is: 630. 

The answer is 630."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1.
