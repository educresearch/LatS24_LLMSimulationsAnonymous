systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

First, we evaluate the prime factor counting (F). The prime factors of 3 are {3}, and the prime factors of 2 are {2}. There are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, so 3 # 2 equals 0.

Next, we perform addition (A) between 5 and 0. 5 + 0 equals 5.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 using the PEFMDASC order, we will follow these steps:

Step 1: Evaluate the expression inside parentheses (P).
Inside the parentheses, we have 14 + 4, which equals 18. Therefore, the expression becomes: 
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3.

Step 2: Evaluate the concatenation operation (C).
The concatenation operation (@) combines the digits of two numbers together. In this case, we have 6 @ 18. So, the expression becomes:
618 + 12 - 2 # 3.

Step 3: Evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F).
The prime factor counting operation (#) calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of two numbers. In this case, we have 2 # 3. Since 2 and 3 do not have any shared prime factors, the result is 0. So, the expression becomes:
618 + 12 - 0.

Step 4: Evaluate the addition and subtraction (A/S) from left to right.
First, we perform the addition operation: 618 + 12 equals 630. So, the expression becomes:
630 - 0.

Finally, we perform the subtraction operation: 630 - 0 equals 630. 

The answer is 630."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together.
