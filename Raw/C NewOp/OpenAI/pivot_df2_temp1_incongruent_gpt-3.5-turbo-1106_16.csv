gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression 4#3 + 2, we need to follow the new order of operations: PEFMDASC.

1. First, we look for any Parentheses. There are no parentheses in the expression.

2. Next, we check for Exponents, but there are no exponents in the expression.

3. Now we evaluate the prime factor counting operation. 
   4#3 = 1 because the prime factor of 4 is 2 and the prime factor of 3 is 3, so there is only 1 shared prime factor.
