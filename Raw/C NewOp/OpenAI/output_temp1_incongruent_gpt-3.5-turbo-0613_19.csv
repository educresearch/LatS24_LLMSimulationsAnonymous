Step 1: Evaluate the expression inside parentheses.
   14 + 4 = 18

Step 2: Evaluate the prime factor counting operation.
   2 # 3 = 0 (since the prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3, and there are no common prime factors)

Step 3: Perform the concatenation operation.
   6 @ 18 = 618 (concatenating the digits of 6 and 18)

Step 4: Perform addition and subtraction from left to right.
   618 + 12 = 630
   630 - 0 = 630 (since the prime factor counting operation resulted in 0)

Therefore, the final answer is 630.

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

systemPrompt3_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations:
1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in the expression. 

2. Exponents: There are no exponents in the expression. 

3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We need to evaluate the prime factor count before addition. 
   The prime factors of 5 are {5}, and the prime factors of 3 are {3}. 
   Since there are no common prime factors between 5 and 3, the prime factor count is 0. 

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There are no multiplication or division operations in the expression. 

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We can now perform addition.

Step 1: Evaluate the concatenation operation (@).
Here, we have 2 @ 4. Since the concatenation operation is done from left to right, we first join the digits of 2 and 4 together, giving us 24.

Step 2: Add the number 5 to the result of the concatenation operation.
Now, we have 5 + 24. Since addition is done after concatenation, we can simply add 5 and 24 to get the final result.

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To simplify the expression using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), let's break it down into steps:

Step 1: Parentheses
We need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first:
(14 + 4) = 18

So the expression becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: Concatenation (C)
We need to evaluate any concatenation operations from left to right. Let's calculate the first concatenation:
6 @ 18 = 618

So the expression becomes:
618 + 12 - 2#3

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we need to evaluate any prime factor counting operations. Let's calculate the prime factor counting:
2 # 3 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor between 2 and 3 is 2)

So the expression becomes:
618 + 12 - 1

Step 4: Addition (A)
Next, we need to evaluate any addition operations. Let's calculate the addition:
618 + 12 = 630

So the expression becomes:
630 - 1

Step 5: Subtraction (S)
Finally, we need to evaluate any subtraction operations. Let's calculate the subtraction:
630 - 1 = 629

Therefore, the answer is 629."

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
First, let's calculate the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 5 and 3.
