So first you perform the sum:

5 + 2 = 7,

Then you perform the concatenation:

7 @ 4 = 74.

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: In the given mathematics problem, you first need to perform the Prime Factor Counting operation before addition according to PEFMDASC. 

The prime factor of 8 is 2 and the prime factor of 2 is also 2. Therefore, 8 # 2 equals 1 because they share one common prime factor, which is 2.

The prime factor of 6 is 2 and 3, so 6 # 6 equals 2 because they share two common prime factors, which are 2 and 3.

You then need to perform the addition: 1 (from 8 # 2) + 2 (from 6 # 6) = 3.

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: The given mathematics problem is 4 # 3 + 2

According to the new PEFMDASC order of operations, Prime Factor counting (F) should be done before Addition (A).

In this case:

1. 4 # 3: The unique prime factors of 4 are 2 (2x2) and for 3 it is 3. Hence, they have no common prime factors, so 4 # 3 = 0 
2. Now, we have 0 + 2, which equals to 2.

So, the final solution to the problem is 2.

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: First off, we need to evaluate the operations inside the parentheses and the prime factor counting. Based on the PEFMDASC rule, parentheses should be evaluated first. 

14 + 4 = 18

Now our equation is 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3. Next, we apply the prime factor counting operation, denoted by '#'. 

2 # 3 = 0 
(Because 2 has a prime factor of 2, and 3 has a prime factor of 3, and they have no shared prime factor.)

So, the equation becomes 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0.
Next we perform the operations according to the rule, which means addition comes before concatenation.

18 + 12 = 30 

So, the equation becomes 6 @ 30 - 0.
Next comes Subtraction which is 30 - 0 = 30.

Now, the equation becomes 6 @ 30. Here comes the concatenation step. 

6 @ 30 = 630

So, the answer is 630."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: The given mathematics problem is 5 + 3 # 2

According to the new PEFMDASC order of operations, Prime Factor counting (F) should be done before Addition (A).

First, let's perform the Prime Factor counting operation between 3 and 2:
3 # 2 = 1 (since the only prime factor of 3 is 3, and the only prime factor of 2 is 2, there are no shared prime factors. Therefore, 3 # 2 equals 0).

The expression now simplifies to: 5 + 0

Finally, perform the addition operation: 5 + 0 = 5

So, the final answer to the problem is 5.

The answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve this, first, we need to follow the revised order of operations (PEFMDASC). The operation in this problem involves only 'A' Addition and 'C' Concatenation. So, since Addition comes before Concatenation in the revised order of operations, we need to carry out addition before concatenation.

The operation is: 5 + 2 @ 4

First execute 'A' Addition:
5 + 2 = 7

So the operation becomes: 7 @ 4

Then execute 'C' Concatenation:
7 @ 4 = 74

So, The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: Here's how to solve the mathematical expression using the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

Start by evaluating the Prime Factor Counts:
8 # 2 = 1 (since prime factor of 8 is 2 and prime factor of 2 is 2)
6 # 6 = 1 (since prime factor of 6 is 2 and 3, there is only 1 shared prime factor)

So, the expression becomes:
1 + 1

Finally sum up the two results:
1 + 1 = 2

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this, first evaluate the operation following the new order of operations.

According to the order of operations PEFMDASC:

F: Prime Factor Counting should be done next. The prime factor of absolute value of 4 is 2 and the prime factor of absolute value of 3 is 3. These two numbers don't share any prime factors, so 4 # 3 is 0.

So, the equation becomes 0 + 2.

A: Addition is to be done next. So, 0 + 2 equals 2.

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: According to the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

Start by evaluating the operations inside parenthese:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Then, compute the prime factor counting between 2 and 3:

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

Then, concatenate 6 and 18:

= 618 + 12 - 1

Then, perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right:

= 630 - 1
= 629.

So, the answer is 629."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve this, first, we need to follow the revised order of operations (PEFMDASC). The Prime Factor Counting operation comes before addition:

Prime factors of 3 are 3. Prime factors of 2 are 2. 

So, 3 # 2 = 0 (there is no shared prime factor between 3 and 2).

Therefore, the original expression of 5 + 3 # 2 becomes 5 + 0.

Finally, 5 + 0 = 5.

The answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Using the new operations and order of operations:

First, we should perform the addition operation before the concatenation based on PEFMDASC.
So, 5 + 2 = 7

Then, we perform the concatenation operation:
7 @ 4 = 74.

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: According to the new operations introduced and the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), 

Firstly, we'll calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation since that comes first in our new PEFMDASC hierachy.

(a) 8 # 2 means we're checking common prime factors of 8 and 2. The prime factors of 8 are 2 and the prime factors of 2 is also 2. So, we have one common factor.

8 # 2 = 1

Similarly,

(b) 6 # 6 means we're checking common prime factors of 6 and 6. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 and they are the same for both since both numbers are the same. So, we have two common factors.

6 # 6 = 2

So now our equation looks like this: 1 + 2. 

Then we evaluate the addition operation as per PEFMDASC. 

1 + 2 = 3

Therefore, the final answer to the Math problem 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 is 3.

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: Using the new operations and order of operations introduced:

(i) 4 # 3 + 2
= 0 + 2 (since 4 # 3 = 0 because there are no common unique prime factors between 4 and 3)

So, 4 # 3 + 2 = 2.

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: Firstly, you need to perform the operation in the parentheses:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Now you apply the updated Order of Operations, PEFMDASC.

The operation that comes first is Prime Factor Counting (F):

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1
    (since the prime factors of 2 are 2 and the prime factors of 3 are 3, i.e., there is no shared prime factor)

The operation that comes next is Addition (A):
  
= 6 @ 18 + 11
    (since 12 - 1 = 11)

The operation that comes last is Concatenation (C):

= 618 + 11
    (since 6 concatenated with 18 equals 618)

= 629

So the answer to the problem is 629."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: Using the new operations and order of operations:

First, we calculate the prime factor counting operation (F), as it comes before addition in the operations order:

The prime factors of 3 are {3}, and the prime factors of 2 are {2}. There are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2. 

So, 3 # 2 = 0.

The calculation now becomes: 5 + 0

Then we perform the addition:

5 + 0 = 5.

So, the final answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: According to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we should perform the addition operation (A) before the Concatenation (C).
Let's solve the expression:

1. Solve addition operation: 5 + 2 = 7
2. Now, perform Concatenation operation: 7 @ 4

This converts 7 and 4 into their absolute values, concatenates them together as integers, and results in 74. 

So, 5 + 2 @ 4 = 74. 

Therefore, The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: In the expression ""8 # 2 + 6 # 6"", we follow the PEFMDASC order of operations. Here, we have a Prime Factor Counting operation and an Addition operation. According to the PEFMDASC, Prime Factor Counting (F), comes before Addition (A). Hence we perform the Prime Factor Counting operation first.

Step 1: Evaluate 8 # 2
The prime factors of 8 are 2. The prime factors of 2 are also 2. Therefore, 8 and 2 share 1 unique prime factor, which is 2.
Thus, 8 # 2 results in 1.

The expression now is: 1 + 6 # 6.

Step 2: Evaluate 6 # 6
The prime factor of 6 is 2 and 3. Since the numbers are the same, they obviously share the same prime factors i.e., 2 and 3.
Since there are 2 unique prime factors, 6 # 6 is 2.

The expression now is: 1 + 2.

Step 3: Evaluate Addition
According to PEFMDASC, Addition (A) is the next operation to perform.
1 + 2 is 3. 

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: Given the expression 4 # 3 + 2, we will solve it using the order of operations PEFMDASC:

First Step (Using F operation: Prime Factor Counting):
We will look at prime factors of both 4 and 3:
- The prime factors of 4 are {2}
- The prime factors of 3 are {3}

As there are no common prime factors between 4 and 3, we know that 4 # 3 = 0.
So, 4 # 3 + 2 becomes 0 + 2.

Second step (Using A operation: Addition):
We will then add 0 to 2 which is 2.

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: Let's start solving using the PEFMDASC order of operations.

Step 1 (Parentheses):
First, calculate the value inside the parentheses: (14 + 4). 

14 + 4 equals 18.

So, the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3.

Step 2 (Exponents):
There are no exponents in this expression, so we skip this step.

Step 3 (Prime Factor counting):
Evaluate the prime factor counting operation: 2 # 3.

The prime factors of 2 are: 2.
The prime factors of 3 are: 3.

2 and 3 share no prime factors. Hence, 2 # 3 equals 0.

So, the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0.

Step 4 (Multiplication and Division):
There is no multiplication or division in this expression, so we skip this step.

Step 5 (Addition and Subtraction):
We perform the addition: 18 + 12. It equals 30.

So, the expression becomes: 6 @ 30 - 0.

Next, we perform the subtraction: 30 - 0. It equals 30.

So, the expression becomes: 6 @ 30.

Step 6 (Concatenation):
Now, perform the concatenation operation: 6 @ 30.

It joins the numbers 6 and 30 together, leading to 630.

The answer is 630."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: Given the expression 5 + 3 # 2, we will solve it using the order of operations PEFMDASC:

First, there are no parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, or subtraction that can be evaluated ahead.

Next, we see Prime Factor Counting symbol (#), and we should solve this first according to PEFMDASC. 
Prime Factor Counting (F): 3 # 2
The prime factors of 3 are {3}, and the prime factors of 2 are {2}. There are no shared factors, so 3 # 2 = 0.

Now the expression is 5 + 0.

Finally, we can perform the addition:

5 + 0 = 5

So, the solution to the given expression 5 + 3 # 2 using the updated order of operations is 5.
