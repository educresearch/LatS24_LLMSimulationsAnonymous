We calculate the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 8 and 2:
8 = 2 * 2 * 2 (prime factors: 2)
2 = 2 (prime factors: 2)
The shared prime factor is 2, so 8 # 2 = 1.

Now, calculate the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 6 and 6:
6 = 2 * 3 (prime factors: 2, 3)
6 = 2 * 3 (prime factors: 2, 3)
