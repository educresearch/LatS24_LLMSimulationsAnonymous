gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, follow the new PEFMDASC order of operations. Here it is solved step-by-step:

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F):
8#2 --> 
The prime factors of 8 are 2, and for 2, it is 2. They share the prime factor 2.
So, 8#2 = 1

6#6 -->
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, since 6 is with itself, it shares the same prime factors 2 and 3.
So, 6#6 = 2

Step 2: Addition (A):
1 + 2 = 3

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: Let's first break down the operations in the given problem and then follow the order of operation PEFMDASC.

Here is the given problem: 

4 # 3 + 2

Let's start with the prime factor counting operation (#).
The prime factors of 4 are 2 and the prime factors of 3 are 3. They have no common prime factors. 

Therefore, 4 # 3 = 0

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: The problem given is 6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3. 

Let's begin breaking down the problem following the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. Parentheses first: 
Address the parentheses (14+4) to get 18.
So, the problem becomes: 6@18 + 12-2 # 3.

2. Then, evaluate the prime factor counting:
Next, find the shared prime factors between 2 and 3. As there are no shared prime factors, 2 # 3 is 0.
So, substitute this into the equation to get: 6@18 + 12-0.

3. The next operations to handle are multiplication and division, but they don't appear here.

4. So, move to addition and subtraction:
Evaluate 12 - 0 to get 12.
So, the problem becomes: 6@18 + 12.

5. Continue with addition and subtraction: 
Now we can do the addition to get: 6 @ 30.

6. The final operation is concatenation: 
Following the definition for concatenation, 6@30 gives us 630.

So, the final answer to the problem 6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3 is 630.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: Let's first break down the operations in the given problem and identify the order of operations as per the new rules:

5 + 3#2 

Based on the newly defined order of operations, we need to evaluate the prime factorization counting operation (#) before addition. 

The operation 3#2 means we need to find the count of unique prime factors common between 3 and 2. 

The prime factors of 3 are 3 itself and the prime factors of 2 are 2 itself. There are no common factors between 3 and 2, so 3#2 equals 0.

Then we replace 3#2 by 0 in the given problem, 

So, it becomes 5 + 0. 

The operation of addition results in 5. 

Thus, the answer to the given problem is 5. So, 

The answer is 5."

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: In this mathematics problem, we are given the operation 4 # 3 + 2, and we need to solve it according to the new order of operations, PEFMDASC.

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting - According to the order of operations, we need to perform the Prime Factor Counting operation specified by the operator #. 

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 and for 3 it's 3. So, the number of unique prime factors shared by 4 and 3 is 0. Therefore, 
4 # 3 = 0.

Hence, our revised equation is now 0 + 2.

Step 2: Addition - Lastly, we then perform the Addition operation specified by the operator +.

So, 0 + 2 = 2.

Therefore, the answer to the given problem, following the newly established order of operations, is 2.

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: First, solve for the parentheses:

  6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3
= 6@18 + 12-2  #  3  (14+4 = 18)

Next, perform the specified operations according to the new PEFMDASC order;

Remember Prime Factor Counting (F):

= 6@18 + 12-0  (2 and 3 are the prime factors of 12. But 3 has no prime factor, thus there is no shared prime factor).
= 6@18 + 12 

Next is Concatenation (C):

= 618 + 12 ( 6 @ 18 = 618)
= 630 (618+12 = 630)

So, The answer is 630."

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: To solve this query, we will follow the PEFMDASC rule. 

First, we handle the operation inside the parentheses (P).
6@(14+4) + 12 - 2  #  3
= 6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, the Prime Factor Counting (F). 
Closely examining the equation: 12 and 3 share the common prime factor of 3. 

Hence, the prime factor count (F) of 12 and 3 is 1. We replace the prime factor count operation in the equation by the resultant number i.e,1.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: Let's break down the calculation using the updated order of operations: PEFMDASC. 

Step 1 (Parentheses): 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3 = 6@18 + 12-2 # 3
Here, the addition within parentheses `(14+4)` is calculated first.

Step 2 (Exponent): There are no exponents in this problem.

Step 3 (Prime Factor Counting): 6@18 + 12-2 # 3 = 6@18 + 12-1
The prime factor count of `2` and `3` is calculated as they both share only one prime factor which is `2`.

Step 4 (Multiplication/Division): There are no multiplication or division operations in this problem.

Step 5 (Addition/Subtraction): 6@18 + 12-1 = 6@18 + 11 
Here, the subtraction `12-1` is done.
