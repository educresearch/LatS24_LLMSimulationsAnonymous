gpt-4-0613,1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: Given the problem: 4 # 3 + 2

First, we need to approach the Prime Factor Counting operation (F): 4 # 3. 
The prime factors of 4 are 2 and the prime factors of 3 is 3. There are no common prime factors, so the result of 4 # 3 is 0.

So, the problem simplifies to: 0 + 2

Then, the sum in the above equation is evaluated, resulting in 2.

Therefore, the answer is 2.","GPT Response: First, following the order of operations (""PEFMDASC""), we need to perform the Prime Factor Counting (F). The number 4 has the prime factor 2, and the number 3 is a prime number itself, hence not having 2 as a factor.

Hence, 4 # 3 = 0.

So, the expression reduces to:

0 + 2

The only operation left to carry out is the Addition (A). So, we add the two numbers together, which gives us 2.

Therefore, the solution is:

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations mentioned in the guidelines above. 

Given:

4 # 3 + 2

Steps:
(i) Evaluate 4 # 3: This operation counts the unique prime factors common to |a| and |b|. The prime factors of 4 are [2] and the prime factors of 3 are [3]. Thus, they do not share any common prime factors. Therefore, 4 # 3 = 0

The problem now becomes: 0 + 2

(ii) Evaluate 0 + 2: Using the normal operations of addition, we know that 0 + 2 = 2.

So, the final answer is 2.

Therefore, after evaluating the given mathematical problem using the new operations and updated order of operations, ""The answer is 2"".","GPT Response: To solve this problem, follow the PEFMDASC order of operations. 

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
4 # 3 = 0 (since prime factors of 4 are 2 and prime factors of 3 is 3, and there are no shared factors.)

So the equation becomes 0 + 2.

Step 2: Addition (A)
0 + 2 = 2

gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Given the problem: 5 + 2 @ 4

According to the new order of operations PEFMDASC, addition (A) comes before concatenation (C). So, we need to perform addition operation before the concatenation.

We have:
= 7 @ 4
= 74

Hence, The answer is 74.","GPT Response: According to the newly revised order of operations, PEFMDASC, we would need to carry out the operation as follows:

We have two operations in the equation: addition and concatenation. According to PEFMDASC, addition (A) comes before concatenation (C), hence, we'll carry out addition first.

5 + 2 = 7

Then the new equation becomes 7 @ 4. 

Next, we carry out the concatenation of 7 and 4.

So, 7 @ 4 = 74.

Thus,

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: Given the problem 5 + 2 @ 4, we apply the new order of operations specified PEFMDASC.

Addition (A) comes before Concatenation (C), hence we must perform the addition operation 5 + 2 first. That gives us 7.

Finally, we perform the concatenation operation with the result 7 @ 4. The result of 7 concatenated with 4 is 74.

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: Given is the expression 5 + 2 @ 4.

Following the PEFMDASC order of operations, we perform addition and subtraction before the new operation of concatenation.

Step 1: Perform the addition operation.
5 + 2 = 7

7 @ 4

The ""@"" symbol represents the operation of concatenation, which simply combines the numbers 7 and 4 as 74.

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: Given the problem: 5 + 3 # 2

According to the new order of operations, PEFMDASC, Prime Factor Counting operation (F) comes before Addition (A). 

The prime factors of 3 are {3}, and the prime factors of 2 are {2}. So, 3 # 2 = 0 as there are no common prime factors. 

Then, the problem simplifies to: 5 + 0

The result of this operation is 5.

So, The answer is 5.","GPT Response: According to the newly revised order of operations, PEFMDASC, we would need to carry out Prime Factor Counting (F) first before the operation of Addition (A).

Starting with Prime Factor Counting (F), the prime factors of |3| = 3 is 3 and the prime factors of |2| = 2 is 2. Therefore, there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, hence, for the operation of 3 # 2 = 0.

Then, the operation becomes:

5 + 0 = 5.

This follows the order of operations where prime factor counting was performed before addition.

So, the answer to the given mathematical problem, 5 + 3 # 2, according to the newly introduced mathematical operations and updated order of operations is 5.

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: To solve the problem, you follow the Updated Order of Operations: PEFMDASC. According to PEFMDASC, the Prime Factor Counting operation must be performed before Addition. 

The operation is 5 + 3 # 2. 

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting
Prime factors of 3 are [3] and prime factors of 2 are [2]. Therefore, there are no shared prime factors between them. So, 3 # 2 = 0.

gpt-4-0613,1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: First, we carry out the operation in the parentheses:
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we carry out the prime factor counting operation:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (since the prime factor of 2 is 2 and the prime factor of 3 is 3, i.e., no shared prime factor).

Then, we proceed with the concatenation:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 
= 618 + 12 - 1

Next, we conduct the addition:
618 + 12 - 1
= 630 - 1

Finally, we do the subtraction: 
630 - 1 
= 629

So, the answer is 629.","GPT Response: Firstly, according to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), Parentheses(P) is firstly evaluated. Therefore, the operation inside the parentheses is evaluated.

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we calculate the Prime Factor counting(F) as it comes after Parentheses and Exponents(E), but there are no exponents in our expression:

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1
(each of 2 and 3 has one prime factor, 2 and 3 respectively, and there is no shared prime factor, so the count is 0)

Now, according to the rule, the operations of Multiplication or Division (M/D) and Addition or Subtraction (A/S) are carried out, but since we don't have any Multiplication or Division, we perform addition:

= 6 @ 18 + 11
= 6 @ 29

In the end, we perform the Concatenation operation (C) according to the rule (left to right):

Hence, the answer is 629.","GPT Response: Using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), let's break down the problem:

Step 1 (P - Parentheses): Solve the operation inside the parentheses first.
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2 (F - Prime Factor Counting): Now, before executing any addition/substraction or concatenation, perform the Prime Factor Counting operation
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (since 2 and 3 have 1 common prime factor - 2)

Step 3 (A/S - Addition/Subtraction): Perform addition and subtraction from left to right
= 6 @ 30 - 1
= 6 @ 29 

Step 4 (C - Concatenation): Finally, perform the Concatenation operation.

Therefore, the solution to the math problem 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 according to the new operation and the updated order of operations is 629.

The answer is 629.","GPT Response: Let's solve 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

Step 2: There are no exponents

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1
Here, prime factors of 2 are 2, and prime factors of 3 are 3. Therefore, no common prime factors are shared, hence the count is 0.

Step 4: There are no multiplication or division operations

Step 5: Evaluate Addition and Subtraction (left to right)

gpt-4-0613,1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: The operations in the question are arranged according to the new order of operations, PEFMDASC.

Firstly, Prime Factor Counting operation (F) comes before Addition (A) in the new order of operations. Therefore, we need to perform the prime factor counting before we can do the addition.

8 # 2 = 1 (since the prime factors of 8 are 2, and the prime factors of 2 is 2 also. There is 1 shared prime factor, 2)

6 # 6 = 1 (since the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 while 6 has the same prime factors, 2 and 3. Therefore there is 1 shared prime factor, 2)

We then replace the prime factor counting operations in the original question with their results.

So the original problem 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 becomes 1 + 1.

Next, we perform the addition operation, 1 + 1 = 2

Therefore, the answer to the problem is 2. 

""The answer is 2.""","GPT Response: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6
= 1 + 1 (since prime factor counting is before addition and the shared prime factor between 8 and 2, and between 6 and 6 is 2)
= 2 

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Let's decompose for the given problem.

Firstly, Prime Factor Counting operation (F) comes before the addition operation (A). This means we have to evaluate 8 # 2 and 6 # 6 first.

Prime factors of 8 are 2.
Prime factors of 2 are 2.
Thus, 8 # 2 = 1 (since the shared prime factor is 2).

On the other hand, prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
Since 6 # 6 is counting the shared prime factors of the same number, all the prime factors are shared.
Thus, 6 # 6 = 2 (since the shared prime factors are 2 and 3).

Now we can substitute these values back to the original problem.
This becomes 1 + 2.

Finally, we evaluate the addition to find the result which is 3.

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: The problem contains two operations: prime factor counting (#) and addition (+). 

Step 1: Based on the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), prime factor counting is performed before addition. So, we start by finding the common prime factors of the given numbers.

The prime factors of 8 are 2, and the prime factors of 2 are also 2. They share 1 common prime factor, which is 2. Hence, 8 # 2 equals to 1. 

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and since 6 repeats, its prime factors are also 2 and 3. Therefore, they share two common prime factors, which are 2 and 3. Hence, 6 # 6 equals to 2.

Therefore, the given expression becomes:

= 1 + 2

Step 2: Now, there is only one operation left: addition. We calculate this to get our final answer. 

= 3

So, the answer is 3."
