                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

First, let's find the prime factors of 8:
The prime factors of 8 are 2 (count: 3) and 2 (count: 1), so the total count is 3 + 1 = 4.

Next, let's find the prime factors of 2:
The prime factor of 2 is 2.

So, the prime factor count (F) of 8 and 2 is 2.

Now, let's find the prime factors of 6:
The prime factors of 6 are 2 (count: 1) and 3 (count: 1), so the total count is 1 + 1 = 2.

Next, let's find the prime factors of 6:
The prime factors of 6 are 2 (count: 1) and 3 (count: 1), so the total count is 1 + 1 = 2.

So, the prime factor count (F) of 6 and 6 is 2.

Now, we can move on to the next operation in the order of operations, which is addition and subtraction (A/S).

The result of 8 # 2 is 2.
The result of 6 # 6 is 2.

So, the expression becomes: 2 + 2.

Finally, we can perform the addition and get the final answer:
2 + 2 = 4.

Therefore, the answer to the given expression ""8 # 2 + 6 # 6"" is 4.

The answer is 4."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    P: Parentheses

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this expression using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), let's break it down step by step:

Step 1: Solve within parentheses (P)
Inside the parentheses, we have 14 + 4. Evaluating this addition first gives us 18.

The expression becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Calculate the concatenation (C)
Next, let's look for any concatenation (@) operations. We have 6 @ 18.

Concatenation joins the digits of the two numbers together. So, the result of 6 @ 18 is 618.

The expression becomes:
618 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 3: Perform prime factor counting (F)
Now, let's evaluate any prime factor counting (#) operations. We have 2 # 3.

There are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3, so the result of 2 # 3 is 0.

The expression becomes:
618 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Perform addition and subtraction (A/S)
Next, let's evaluate the addition and subtraction from left to right.

618 + 12 is 630.

The expression becomes:
630 - 0

Step 5: Perform concatenation (C)
Finally, let's evaluate the concatenation operation, if any.

There are no more concatenation operations.

The expression simplifies to:
630 - 0

Step 6: Perform subtraction (A/S)
Perform the remaining subtraction.

630 - 0 is 630.

The final answer is:
The answer is 630."
