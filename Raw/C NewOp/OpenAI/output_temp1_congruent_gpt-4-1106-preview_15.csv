Given the problem 5 + 2 @ 4, we notice that the problem involves addition (A) and concatenation (C).

According to the new order of operations, we must perform addition before concatenation:

1. Perform the addition 5 + 2:
   \( 5 + 2 = 7 \)

2. Perform the concatenation with the result and 4:
   \( 7 @ 4 = 74 \) (because the result of concatenation is the digits of 7 and 4 joined together)

Thus, the final result is \( 74 \).

The answer is 74."

systemPrompt1_userPrompt2_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Before providing the answer, it's important to correct an error in the given information about the prime factors of the number 4. In the second operation (F) Prime Factor Counting operation, the listed example states that the prime factors of 16 are 2, and the prime factors of 4 are 5, which is incorrect. The prime factor of 4 is 2, not 5.

With that correction in mind, let's evaluate the given mathematical expression: 8#2 + 6#6

Firstly, we need to determine the unique prime factors of the numbers involved:

Prime factors of 8: 2 (since 8 = 2^3)
Prime factors of 2: 2 
Prime factors of 6: 2, 3

Now we use the prime factor counting operation (#):

8#2 counts the number of unique prime factors that 8 and 2 share. Since both have the prime factor 2,
8#2 = 1.

6#6 counts the number of unique prime factors that 6 shares with itself, which are 2 and 3.
6#6 = 2 (since it has two unique prime factors: 2 and 3).

Now we can use the new order of operations PEFMDASC to solve the expression:
8#2 + 6#6
= 1 + 2 (since we perform prime factor counting before addition)
= 3

So, the final answer is ""The answer is 3."""

6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3

We start by evaluating what's inside the parentheses:

6@(14+4)
= 6@(18)
Now we move to prime factor counting (F) before performing addition or subtraction:

6@(18) + 12 - 2 # 3
Since prime factor counting is before addition and subtraction, we evaluate 2 # 3:

2 # 3 = 0 (since there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3)
= 6@(18) + 12 - 0
Now we continue with addition/subtraction from left to right:

= 6@(18) + 12
= 6@18 + 12
After that, we perform the concatenation (C):

Finally, we do the addition:

The first operation we see is the Prime Factor Counting (F). We need to perform the prime factor counting on the pairs of numbers before doing any addition.

Let's do the prime factor counting:
1. 8#2 - The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or 2^3). The prime factors of 2 are just 2. The shared prime factor is 2, and since it's only one prime factor, the result of 8#2 is 1.
2. 6#6 - The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since both numbers are the same (6 and 6), all the prime factors are shared. Here, we have two unique prime factors (2 and 3), so the result of 6#6 is 2.

The steps are as follows:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
   To start, we will perform the prime factor counting on the numbers 4 and 3.
   - The prime factorization of 4 is \( 2 \times 2 \).
   - The prime factorization of 3 is \( 3 \).
   There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so \( 4 \# 3 = 0 \).

2. Addition (A):
   After counting the prime factors, we add \( 0 \) to \( 2 \):
   \( 0 + 2 = 2 \).

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents in the expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
We need to find the number of unique prime factors shared by 2 and 3.

5 + 2 @ 4

There aren't any parentheses, exponents, or prime factor counting involved in this expression, so we continue with addition first.

5 + 2 = 7

Now we move to the last operation, which is concatenation:

7 @ 4

According to the definition of the concatenation operation, we merge the digits of 7 and 4:

7 @ 4 = 74

Therefore, the final answer is:

They share a single prime factor of 2.

Thus, 8#2 = 1.

Next, we evaluate 6#6:

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
Since the numbers are identical, they share the same prime factors.

The prime factor of 3 is 3.

Since there are no common prime factors between 4 and 3, the prime factor counting gives us 0.

The given problem is:
6@(14+4) + 12-2#3

Step 1: Evaluate what's inside the parentheses first (P):
6@(14+4) + 12-2#3
= 6@(18) + 12-2#3

Step 2: Evaluate the prime factor counting (F) next, before other operations:
Since 2 and 3 share a common prime factor of 2:
6@(18) + 12-2#3
= 6@(18) + 12-1

Step 3: Next, perform the multiplication/division (M/D) and addition/subtraction (A/S):
Since there's no multiplication or division directly involved here, we move on to addition and subtraction. But keep in mind that we don't perform the concatenation yet. We will resolve the addition and subtraction happening outside of the concatenation operation:
6@(18) + 12-1
= 6@(18) + 11

Step 4: Concatenation (C) operation is performed last:
Finally, we perform the concatenation operation:
6@(18) + 11

                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses to evaluate.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents to evaluate.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We need to evaluate the prime factor counting before moving on to addition.

Calculating 3#2:
- The prime factors of 3 are just 3 since 3 is a prime number.
- The prime factors of 2 are just 2 since 2 is a prime number.
- There are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, so 3#2 = 0.

Now the expression is simplified to: 5 + 0

4. Multiplication/Division (M/D): There is no multiplication or division to perform.
5. Addition/Subtraction (A/S): We have an addition to perform.

5 + 0 = 5

6. Concatenation (C): There is no concatenation operation to perform.

So the final answer is:

Expression: 4 # 3 + 2

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): We first calculate the number of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 4 and 3.

- The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (or just 2, since we are interested in unique factors).
- The prime factors of 3 are just 3.

There are no shared unique prime factors between 4 and 3, so 4 # 3 = 0.

Now our expression looks like this: 0 + 2

2. Addition (A): We now perform the addition step.

0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

Given expression: 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3

Step 1: Evaluate the parentheses.
\[ 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3 \]
\[ = 6@(18) + 12-2 # 3 \]

Step 2: No exponents to evaluate in the expression.

Step 3: Next, evaluate the prime factor counting (F).
\[ 6@(18) + 12-2 # 3 \]
The prime factors of 2 are only 2 itself, and the prime factors of 3 include 3 only; they have no shared prime factors.
\[ = 6@(18) + 12 - 0 \]

Step 4: There is no multiplication or division operation to perform next.

Step 5: Perform addition and subtraction (from left to right).
\[ 6@(18) + 12 - 0 \]
\[ = 6@(18) + 12 \]

Step 6: Lastly, perform the concatenation (C).
\[ 6@(18) + 12 \]
Concatenate 6 and 18:
