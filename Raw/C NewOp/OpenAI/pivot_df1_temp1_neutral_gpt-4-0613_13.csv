gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: We have the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6.

Before evaluating, take a look at the prime factors of each number:
- The prime factors of 8 are 2.
- The prime factors of 2 are 2.
They have 1 common prime factor, which is 2.

- The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
- The prime factors of 6, again, are 2 and 3.
They have 2 common prime factors, which are 2 and 3.

The new expression is 0 + 2.

Then, calculate the Addition operation. This is simple: 0 + 2 = 2.

So, the answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: First, we need to perform the operation inside the parentheses:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, because of PEFMDASC order, we perform prime factor counting:

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1
(since the prime factors of |2| are 2 only, and the prime factors of |3| is 3, they share no prime factors which results in 2 # 3 = 0)

Then subtraction is done:

= 6 @ 18 + 11

Then addition will be performed:

= 6 @ 29

Finally, we perform the concatenation:

= 629

So the final answer is 629. Therefore,

The answer is 629."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we must use the newly updated order of operations PEFMDASC. 

Here, we have addition '5 + 3' and Prime Factor Counting '3 # 2'. According to the new order of operations, we need to perform Prime Factor Counting operation before the Addition operation.

The Prime Factor Counting '3 # 2' means we should count the unique prime factors shared by |3| and |2|. The prime factor of 3 is 3, and the prime factor of 2 is 2. Therefore, there is no shared prime factor, hence the result of the operation '3 # 2' is 0.

Substituting this value back into the expression gives '5 + 0', which equals 5.

Therefore, the answer is 5."

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: We're given the equation 8 # 2 + 6 # 6. Now, the '#' symbol represents the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation, and the updated order of operations tells us to perform Prime Factor Counting before addition (A).

First, we need to find the prime factors of the numbers involved. The prime factors of 8 are 2, which is repeated thrice. For 2, the only prime factor is 2 itself. For 6, the prime factors are 2 and 3.

We then use the Prime Factor Counting operation to find out how many unique prime factors the sets of numbers share.

8 # 2 = 1 (since the only prime factor of 2, which is 2, is also a prime factor of 8)

6 # 6 = 1 (since 6 shares all of its prime factors with itself, but considering unique ones we get 1 as result)

After having computed these values, we can substitute back into the original equation:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 1 = 2

Therefore, the answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this, we must follow the PEFMDASC order of operations. So, the operation Prime Factor Counting (F) comes before Addition (A) :

We need to find the common prime factor(s) between 4 and 3.

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (i.e., only 1 unique prime which is 2)
The prime factors of 3 are 3.

So, there are no common primes between 4 and 3. 

Hence, 4 # 3 = 0

The problem simplifies to 0 + 2.
Now execute addition: 0 + 2 = 2.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: According to the new order of operations, parentheses should be executed first. Inside the parentheses, we only have the addition operation, which is straightforward:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 (since 14 + 4 = 18)

Next, we execute the prime factor counting operation (F):

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (since the prime factor of 2 is 2 and for 3 is 3. These two numbers do not share any common factor, hence the result is 0)

Then, we perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right:

= 6 @ 18 + 11 (since 12 - 1 = 11)
= 6 @ 29 (since 18 + 11 = 29)

Finally, perform the concatenation operation:
