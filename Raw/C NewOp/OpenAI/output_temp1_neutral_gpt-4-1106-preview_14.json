Concatenation (C) from left to right\n\nHere's the given problem: \\(6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 \\# 3\\)\n\nLet's solve it step by step:\n\nStep 1: Parentheses\nFirst, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parenthesis, \\(14 + 4\\).\n\n\\(6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 \\# 3\\)\n\\(6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 \\# 3\\)\n\nStep 2: Exponents\nThere are no exponents to evaluate.\n\nStep 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)\nNext, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation, \\(2 \\# 3\\).\n\nThe prime factors of 2 are {2}, and the prime factors of 3 are {3}. They have no shared prime factors.\n\nThus, \\(2 \\# 3 = 0\\).\n\n\\(6 @ 18 + 12 - 0\\)\n\nStep 4: Multiplication (M) and Division (D)\nThere are no multiplication or division operations to evaluate.\n\nStep 5: Addition (A) and Subtraction (S)\nWe have addition and subtraction operations here. Since there is no further need to consider the prime factor counting (which has been already evaluated), we proceed with these operations from left to right.\n\nFirst, we add \\(12\\) to the result of the concatenation which we will perform later:\n\n\\(6 @ 18 + 12 - 0\\)\n\\(6 @ 18 + 12"}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400", "model": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 400, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "Introduction to New Mathematical Operations and Updated Order of Operations\n\n                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.\n\n                    New Operations:\n                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. \n                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):\n                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.\n                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.\n                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.\n                    \n                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. \n                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):\n                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1\n                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) \n                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. \n                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)\n                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. \n                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)\n                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.\n                    It's crucial to get this right for accurate calculations.\n                    \n                    Revised Order of Operations: PEFMDASC\n                    P: Parentheses\n                    E: Exponents\n                    F: Prime Factor counting\n                    M/D: Multiplication and Division (left to right)\n                    A/S: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)\n                    C: Concatenation (left to right)\n                    \n                    Important Examples Demonstrating New Operations and Order:\n                    (i) 5 @ 3 + 6\n                    = 5 @ 9 (since we need to evaluate addition before concatenation)\n                    = 59\n\n                    (ii) 5 # 3 + 6\n                    = 0 + 6 (since we need to evaluate prime factorization before addition)\n                    = 6\n\n                    (iii) 5 - 3 @ 6\n                    = 2 @ 6 (since we need to evaluate subtraction before concatenation)\n                    = 26\n\n                    (iv) 5 - 3 # 6\n                    = 5 - 1 (since we need to evaluate prime factorization before subtraction)\n                    = 4\n\n                    (vi) (3 + 10 # 2) * 5 @ 42 \n                    = (3 + 1) * 5 @ 42 (we need to evaluate what is in the parenthesis first and prime factor counting is before addition)\n                    = 4 * 5 @ 42  (we need to evaluate multiplication before concatenation\n                    = 20 @ 42 = 2042.

For the expression 3 # 2, we will count the shared unique prime factors of 3 and 2:\n\n- The prime factors of 3 are just 3.\n- The prime factors of 2 are just 2.\n\nSince there are no prime factors in common, 3 # 2 equals 0.\n\nSo our expression 5 + 3 # 2 becomes 5 + 0.\n\n4.
