      <td>GPT Response: To solve the mathematical expression given, we'll employ the updated order of operations PEFMDASC: Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction, Concatenation.<br><br>Firstly, we will deal with what's within the parentheses (P).<br>6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 <br>= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 <br><br>Next, we'll evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F).<br>6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (since prime factors of 2 are [2] and prime factors of 3 are [3], no shared prime factor exists)<br>= 6 @ 18 + 11 <br><br>Then, we perform Addition and Subtraction (A/S).<br>6 @ 29 <br>Finally, we perform the Concatenation (C).<br>629<br>Therefore, The answer is 629.</td>
