Hence, the solution to the mathematics problem given would be:
It means we have to add 5 to the concatenation of 2 and 4. 

First, we perform the concatenation operation, 2 @ 4, because it is in a parentheses.
So, 2 @ 4 = 24

Then we add the 5.
So final calculation: 5 + 24 = 29

Therefore, the answer is 29."

We are given: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

Step 1: Resolve parentheses first: 

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: Next, prime factor counting because there is no exponentiation:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (since prime factors of 2 are 2 and prime factors of 3 are 3, i.e., no shared prime factors, thus 0.)

Step 3: Addition and subtraction come next:

24 - 0 = 24

Step 4: Finally, the concatenation:

6 @ 24 = 624

So, the final result of the given calculation is 624.

The answer is 624."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

4#3 means we're looking for the count of unique prime factors common to 4 and 3. The prime factors of 4 are 2 (2*2), and the prime factor of 3 is 3, so there are no prime factors shared between 4 and 3. Hence, 4#3 equals 0.

Breaking this down according to the updated order of operations, we perform parentheses operation first:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Since ""Prime Factor Counting"" comes before ""addition and subtraction"" and ""Concatenation"" in the order of operations. So let's deal with that: 2#3 implies we have to find the common unique prime factors for 2 and 3.

But 2 and 3 are both prime numbers and they do not have any common prime factor. Hence, 2#3 is equal to 0. 

So, our equation becomes:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Now we proceed further with the equation from left to right, performing the operations of addition and subtraction, and finally the concatenation operation:

6@18 is performed last since concatenation is the last operation in the updated order of operation. Before that, we do the addition operation:

18 + 12 equals 30.

Subtracting 0 from 30 yields 30:

30 - 0 equals 30.

Now we perform the concatenation:

6 @ 30 gives us 630.

Following the order of operations, the solution to 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3 is 630.

So, ""The answer is 630."""

a = 3 and b = 2 in the operation a # b.

Prime factors of 3 include only 3 (since 3 is a prime number itself).
Prime factors of 2 include only 2 (since 2 is a prime number itself).

Therefore, a # b = 3 # 2 = 0 (since there are no shared prime factors).

Next, we proceed to the addition operation:

5 + 0 = 5

So, the final answer for the given mathematical problem ""5+3 # 2"" based on the newly updated order of operations is 5.

The answer is 5."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0.

Addition comes first in the PEFMDASC order:

Next, we continue with the Concatenation operation which comes last in the PEFMDASC order of operations. But since the addition operation has consumed the original '2', we will replace the '2' in ""2 @ 4"" with the result of the Addition operation that we just calculated above:

The prime factor of 4 is 2.
The prime factor of 3 is 3.
As they do not share a common factor, the result of ""4#3"" is 0.

So, the expression now becomes ""0 + 2"".

Step 2: Solve for ""0 + 2"".

Step 1: Solve for Parentheses
6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Execute Prime Factor Count Operation #
6 @ 18 + 12 - 1
(The only shared prime factor between 2 and 3 is 2, hence 2 # 3 equals 1)

Step 3: Proceed with the Addition and Subtraction from left to right
6 @ 18 + 11
= 6 @ 29

Step 4: Finally execute Concatenation
= 629

Therefore, the answer is 629."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.
