systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

First, let's evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F). The prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since there is only 1 shared prime factor (which is 2), we have:

3#2 = 1

Now, we can move on to the addition operation (A):

5 + 1 = 6

Therefore, the final answer is 6.

The answer is 6."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:

                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3, we need to follow the PEFMDASC order of operations. Let's break it down step by step:

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
There are no parentheses in the expression, so we move on to the next step.

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents in the expression, so we move on to the next step.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Let's evaluate the prime factor counting first.
We have 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3

Now, let's compute the prime factors count for the numbers involved:
6 # (14+4) = 6 # 18
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 18 are 2 and 3.
So, the count of shared prime factors is 2.

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
Let's evaluate any multiplication or division operations next.

There is no multiplication or division operation in the expression, so we move on to the next step.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Now, let's evaluate the addition and subtraction operations.

6@(14+4) = 6@18
Converting it to concatenation, we get 618.

So, the expression becomes:
618 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
Finally, let's evaluate the concatenation operation.

618 + 12 - 2 # 3 = 618 + 12 - 23

Step 7: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Now, let's evaluate the prime factor counting.
2 # 3 = 1 (Since there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3)

Step 8: Addition and Subtraction (A/S"

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.
