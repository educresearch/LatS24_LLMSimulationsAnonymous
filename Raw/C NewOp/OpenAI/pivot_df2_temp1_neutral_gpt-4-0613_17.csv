gpt-4-0613,1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: Given the problem 4 # 3 + 2, you would first evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F).

The prime factors of 4 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. The operation 4 # 3 would therefore give you 0 since they share no prime factors.

The expression simplifies to 0 + 2.

Then, you would perform the addition operation. So, 0 + 2 = 2.

Therefore, the answer is 2.","GPT Response: First, we need to count the prime factors using operation F:

4 # 3 gives us 0, since 4 and 3 have no common prime factors (4 has the prime factor 2, 3 is a prime number itself)

Thus, the expression becomes 0 + 2.

And finally, if we add them:

0 + 2 equals 2.

So, the solution to the problem is:

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve this mathematical problem, we follow the new updated order of operations PEFMDASC.

Given: 4 # 3 + 2

First, perform the prime factor counting (F) operation: 4#3. The prime factor of 4 is 2 and the prime factor of 3 is 3. Thus, there are no shared prime factors, so 4 # 3 = 0. 

Our equation then simplifies to: 0 + 2.

gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: Given the problem 5 + 3 # 2, you would first evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F) because according to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), prime factor counting (F) comes before addition (A).

To find 3 # 2, since both 3 and 2 are prime numbers and they do not share any prime factors, the result is 0. 

So, the problem simplifies to: 

5 + 0 

which equals 5.

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: First, according to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to calculate the Prime Factor Counting operation (F).

3 # 2 means calculating the number of unique prime factors shared by 3 and 2. The prime factors of 3 are {3} and the prime factors of 2 are {2}. As the two numbers have no shared prime factor, the operation 3 # 2 results in 0.

So the expression becomes 5 + 0.

Finally, we have the operation 5 + 0, which equals 5.

So, the answer is 5.","GPT Response: Based on the new order of operations PEFMDASC, the operation Prime Factor Counting (#) should be performed first before addition.

Problem: 5 + 3 # 2

Here, we need to find out the unique primary factors common to both 3 and 2. 
The prime factor of 3 is 3 and the prime factor of 2 is 2, and since they do not share a common prime factor, 3 # 2 = 0.

gpt-4-0613,1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: In this problem, we have multiple operations including parentheses, addition, subtraction, prime factor counting (#), and concatenation (@). According to the new application of the order of operations PEFMDASC, we proceed as follows:

We first deal with the parenthetical operation:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Then, we perform the prime factor counting operation:

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 

Subsequently, we perform the addition operation:

= 6 @ 18 + 11

Next, we perform the concatenation operation:

= 618 + 11

Finally, we perform the subtraction operation:

= 629 

The answer is 629.","GPT Response: Following the new order of operations PEFMDASC, 

Step 1: We need to evaluate Parentheses first. So, perform the operation inside the parentheses.

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 (since 14 + 4 = 18)

Step 2: There is no Exponents operation in the equation; move to the next step, Prime Factor Counting.

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (since 2 and 3 both share only one prime factor: 2)

Step 3: There is no Multiplication or Division operation; move straight to Addition / Subtraction.

= 6 @ 18 + 11  (since 12 - 1 = 11)

Finally, perform the Concatenation:

= 617  (since 6 @ 18 = 618 and 618 + 11 = 629)

So, the answer is 629.","GPT Response: Let's break this down based on the updated order of operations PEFMDASC.

Problem: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1 (Parentheses): We deal with the parentheses first. 
In the given problem, (14 + 4) is within parentheses. So, we perform this operation first. 
14 + 4 = 18
So, the problem is now: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2 (Exponents): There are no exponents in the problem so let's go to the next step. 

Step 3 (Prime Factor Counting):
The Prime Factor Counting (F) operation is next in the order. We find 2 # 3.
The prime factors of 2 are just 2, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3. So, the number of common factors is 0.
So, replace 2 # 3 with 0. 
This modifies our problem to: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4 (Multiplication/Division):
There are no Multiplication and Division operations to perform in the problem, hence proceed to the next step.

Step 5 (Addition/Subtraction): 
Now, perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right. 
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 = 6 @ 18 + 12 = 6 @ 30. 
This simplifies the problem to: 6 @ 30

Finally, apply the Concatenation (C) operation: 
6 @ 30 = 630

So, ""The answer is 630.""","GPT Response: Let's solve the equation 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 step by step using the revised order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. Parentheses (P): Start with the parentheses first.
   6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
   => 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Exponents (E): The equation doesn't have any.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
   => 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3
   => 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (since 2 and 3 share only one prime factor which is 2)

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): The equation doesn't have any

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Always go from left to right to give:
   => 6 @ 18 + 11
   => 6 @ 29  

6. Concatenation (C):
   => 629

gpt-4-0613,1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the problem, we should follow the order of operations PEFMDASC.

Starting with the operation (F): Prime Factor Counting
We calculate 8 # 2 and 6 # 6.

Prime factor of 8 is 2, and we can clearly see the only prime factor of 2 is also 2. Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1. 

Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since 6 shares all its prime factors with itself, 6 # 6 = 2.

The expression then becomes: 1 + 2.

Finally, we perform the operation (A): Addition
1 + 2 = 3.

This leads us to the final answer:
The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Here, we'll use the prime factor counting (F) operation with the numbers 8 and 2, and 6 and 6.

The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2. The prime factors of 2 are just 2. They share one unique prime factor, 2. So, 8 # 2 = 1.

Then, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. The prime factors of another 6 are also 2 and 3. They share two unique prime factors, 2 and 3. So, 6 # 6 = 2.

Lastly, we do the addition operation to combine these two results: 1 + 2 = 3.

Therefore, the answer is 3.","GPT Response: Following the rule of PEFMDASC:

First, we should do the Prime Factor Counting (#) operation:

8 # 2 = 1 (since prime factor of 8 is 2, and we have number 2 itself as a factor, so we have 1 shared factor)
6 # 6 = 1 (since we have only one number, its prime factor would be considered as a shared prime factor)

So we substitute and the expression becomes:

1 + 1

Now following the rule of addition:

1 + 1 = 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: First, we apply the Prime Factor Counting (F) since it comes first in the order of operations (PEFMDASC), after Parentheses and Exponents which are not present in this problem.

The prime factors of 8 are 2. 
The prime factors of 2 are 2. 
So, they have 1 common prime factor (2).
Thus, 8 # 2 equals 1.

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
So, they have 2 common prime factors (2 and 3).
Thus, 6 # 6 equals 2.

The equation becomes:

1 + 2

This evaluates to 3.

The answer is 3."
