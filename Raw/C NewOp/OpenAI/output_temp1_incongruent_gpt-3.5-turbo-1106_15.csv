systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-1106_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

First, we need to perform the operations inside the parentheses. However, there are no parentheses in the given expression.

Next, we calculate any exponents. There are no exponents in the given expression.

Then, we move to prime factor counting (F) if applicable. Again, there are no prime factor counting operations in the given expression.

After that, we perform any multiplication or division from left to right. Here, there are no multiplication or division operations.

Following that, we calculate addition or subtraction from left to right. In the given expression, we perform the addition first.

5 + 2@4 becomes 5 + (2@4), and as per the rules of the order of operations, we perform the concatenation next.

We'll solve the expression step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations, which includes the new operations of Concatenation (C) and Prime Factor Counting (F).

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Since there are no parentheses or exponents, we start with prime factor counting. However, in this case, there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 4, so the count of shared prime factors is 0.

5 + 2@4
= 5 + 0

Step 2: Addition (A)

Given expression: 4#3 + 2

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting
4#3 = 0 (since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3)

Step 2: Addition
0 + 2 = 2

Therefore, the answer is 2."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-1106_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Sure! Let's break this down step by step according to the PEFMDASC order.

Step 1: Parentheses
We need to solve the expression inside the parentheses first.
14 + 4 = 18

The expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: Concatenation
Now we need to perform the concatenation operation.
6 @ 18 = 618

The expression becomes: 618 + 12 - 2#3

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting
Next, we need to calculate the shared prime factors between 2 and 3.
2 # 3 = 1 (There is 1 shared prime factor, which is 3)

The expression becomes: 618 + 12 - 1

Step 4: Addition
Now we perform the addition operation.
618 + 12 = 630

The expression becomes: 630 - 1

Step 5: Subtraction
Finally, we perform the subtraction operation.
630 - 1 = 629

The answer is 629."
