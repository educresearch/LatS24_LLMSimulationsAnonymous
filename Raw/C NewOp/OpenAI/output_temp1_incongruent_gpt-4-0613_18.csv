systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: The given problem is 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3. 

Using PEFMDASC order, we first resolve the parentheses:
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3.

Next, we resolve the operations one by one, starting with Prime Factor Counting operation:
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1
(as prime factors of 2 are {2} and prime factors of 3 are {3}, hence, no common factors, so 2#3 = 0).

Next, following the order of operations, we perform Addition and Subtraction before moving to concatenation:
= 6 @ 18 + 11
= 6 @ 29.

Lastly, we perform the Concatenation operation:
= 629.

So, the solution to the given problem is 629. 

The answer is 629."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

Following the order of PEFMDASC operations:

We have to calculate what's inside the parentheses (14+4) first. So, the equation will look like this:  
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3. 

2. Prime Factor Counting (F): 
Then we count the shared prime factors of 2 and 3. The prime factors of 2 are {2}, and the prime factors of 3 are {3}. So there is no shared prime factor, which means 2#3 equals to 0.  

The new equation is : 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0.

3. Addition and Subtraction (A/S):

systemPrompt3_userPrompt2_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: The given problem is:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Let's solve it step by step using the newly updated orders of operations (PEFMDASC).

Step 1 - Prime Factor Counting (F):
8 # 2 evaluates the common prime factors of 8 and 2. The prime factors of 8 are 2, whereas the prime factors of 2 are also 2. Hence, there is one common prime factor.
8 # 2 = 1

Similarly, 6 # 6 evaluates the common prime factors of 6 and 6. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Hence, since it's a comparison with the same number, all prime factors are common.
6 # 6 = 2

So, the problem now simplifies to: 

1 + 2

Step 2 - Addition (A):
We now perform the addition operation.
1+2=3

So, therefore, the answer is 3."

systemPrompt3_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: First, we have to identify the operations in the expression. There are addition (+) and prime factor counting (#) operations present. Following the newly updated orders of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to evaluate prime factor counting before addition.

The order of operations are as follows:

1. Parenthesis (P)
2. Exponents (E)
3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D)
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
6. Concatenation (C)

First, let's evaluate the prime factor counting:

3 # 2 

The prime factors of 3 are {3} and the prime factors of 2 are {2}. There are no common prime factors between these two sets, so 3 # 2 is equal to 0.

So the original expression becomes:

5 + 0

The result of this addition operation is:

5

Therefore, the solution to this problem is 5.

The answer is 5."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

This step is not applicable as the expression doesn't contain any exponent, we move to the next step.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
This step is also not applicable as the expression doesn't contain any usage of the Prime Factor Counting operation, we move to the next step.

Step 4: Multiplication and Division from left to right (M/D)
The operation in our expression doesn't include multiplication or division, we move to the next step.

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    = 20 @ 42 = 2042. (concatenation is last)

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Let's solve the equation 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3 using the PEFMDASC order of operations. 

Step 1: Parentheses
We start with the operation in the parentheses which is addition.
6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3 
=> 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3 

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting
Now, we apply the prime factor counting operation which is denoted by '#' in the expression.
The unique prime factors of 2 are (2) and of 3 are (3). As they do not share any prime factor, 2#3 equals to 0.
So, we have:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction
Next, according to PEFMDASC, we apply addition and subtraction from left to right.
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 
=> 6 @ 18 + 12 
=> 6 @ 30 

Step 4: Concatenation
Finally, we apply the new operation of concatenation. 
6 @ 30 = 630 

So, the result is 630. 

The answer is 630."
