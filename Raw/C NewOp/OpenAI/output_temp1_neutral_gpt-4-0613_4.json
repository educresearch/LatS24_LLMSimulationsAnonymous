So, there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3, so result of 2 # 3 is 0.\n\nSo, our equation will become:\n\n6 @ 18 + 12 - 0\n\nStep 3: Addition and Subtraction\nSince we don't have any Exponents, Multiplication, and Division operations, we go further to Addition and Subtraction. We have one addition operation and one subtraction operation. But in PEFMDASC, addition comes before subtraction. So, we perform the addition operation (6 @ 18) + 12 first:\n\n= 6 @ 18 + 12\n= 6 @ 30\n\nNow we subtract the result of our addition from previous step:\n\n= 6 @ 30 - 0\n= 6 @ 30\n\nStep 4: Concatenation\nNow all that's left is the Concatenation:\n\n= 6 @ 30\n= 630\n\nSo the final answer to this problem is:\n\nThe answer is 630."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400", "model": "gpt-4-0613", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 400, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "Introduction to New Mathematical Operations and Updated Order of Operations\n\n                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.\n\n                    New Operations:\n                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. \n                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):\n                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.\n                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.\n                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.\n                    \n                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. \n                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):\n                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1\n                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) \n                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. \n                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)\n                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. \n                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)\n                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.\n                    It's crucial to get this right for accurate calculations.\n                    \n                    Revised Order of Operations: PEFMDASC\n                    P: Parentheses\n                    E: Exponents\n                    F: Prime Factor counting\n                    M/D: Multiplication and Division (left to right)\n                    A/S: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)\n                    C: Concatenation (left to right)\n                    \n                    Important Examples Demonstrating New Operations and Order:\n                    (i) 5 @ 3 + 6\n                    = 5 @ 9 (since we need to evaluate addition before concatenation)\n                    = 59\n\n                    (ii) 5 # 3 + 6\n                    = 0 + 6 (since we need to evaluate prime factorization before addition)\n                    = 6\n\n                    (iii) 5 - 3 @ 6\n                    = 2 @ 6 (since we need to evaluate subtraction before concatenation)\n                    = 26\n\n                    (iv) 5 - 3 # 6\n                    = 5 - 1 (since we need to evaluate prime factorization before subtraction)\n                    = 4\n\n                    (vi) (3 + 10 # 2) * 5 @ 42 \n                    = (3 + 1) * 5 @ 42 (we need to evaluate what is in the parenthesis first and prime factor counting is before addition)\n                    = 4 * 5 @ 42  (we need to evaluate multiplication before concatenation\n                    = 20 @ 42 = 2042.
