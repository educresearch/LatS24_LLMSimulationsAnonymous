      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the revised order of operations, which is PEFMDASC. Let's break down the expression step by step:<br><br>1.

Prime Factor Counting: 18 and 3 have 1 shared prime factor, which is 3<br>   So the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 1<br><br>3. Concatenation: 6 @ 18 equals 618<br>   So the expression becomes: 618 + 12 - 2 # 1<br><br>4. Addition: 618 + 12 equals 630<br>   So the expression becomes: 630 - 2 # 1<br><br>5.
