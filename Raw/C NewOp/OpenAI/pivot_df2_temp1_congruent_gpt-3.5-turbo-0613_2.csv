First, we evaluate what is inside the parentheses:
14 + 4 = 18

Now, we calculate the concatenation operation:
6 @ 18 = 618

Next, we calculate the subtraction operation:
12 - 2 = 10

Now, we move on to the prime factor counting operation:
10 # 3 = 0
(since the prime factors of 10 are 2 and 5, and the prime factor of 3 is 3, there are no shared prime factors)

Finally, we perform the addition operation:
618 + 0 = 618

Therefore, the answer is 618.","GPT Response: First, we need to compute the expression inside the parentheses:
14 + 4 = 18

Now, we can apply the concatenation operation:
6 @ 18 = 618

Next, we need to compute the prime factor counting operation:
12 # 2 = 1 (since the prime factors of 12 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 2 are only 2, they share 1 prime factor)

Now, we can perform the remaining addition and subtraction:
618 + 12 - 1 = 629

Therefore, the answer is 629.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations: PEFMDASC.

First, let's start with the calculations within parentheses: (14+4) = 18.

Now, let's evaluate the prime factor counting: 18 # 3. The prime factors of 18 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3. Since they have one shared prime factor (3), the result of 18 # 3 is 1.

Moving on to the concatenation operation: 6@(14+4) = 6@18 = 618.

Now let's perform the addition: 618 + 12 = 630.

Finally, let's perform the subtraction: 630 - 2 = 628.

Therefore, the answer is 628.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3 using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we will follow these steps:

Step 1: Evaluate the parentheses (P).
Inside the parentheses, we have 14+4 which equals 18.
So, the expression becomes: 6@(18) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Evaluate the concatenation (C).
Here, 6 is concatenated with 18.
So, the expression becomes: 618 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 3: Evaluate the addition (A) and subtraction (S) from left to right.
First, we add 618 and 12, which equals 630.
So, the expression becomes: 630 - 2 # 3

Now, we subtract 2 from 630, which equals 628
So, the expression becomes: 628 # 3

Step 4: Evaluate the prime factor counting (F).
Here, we need to count the number of shared prime factors between 628 and 3.
The prime factors of 628 are 2 and 157.
The prime factor of 3 is 3.
Since there are no shared prime factors, the count is 0.
