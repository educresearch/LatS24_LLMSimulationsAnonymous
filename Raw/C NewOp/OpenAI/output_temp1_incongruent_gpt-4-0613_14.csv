Next, the prime factor of 6 is 2 and 3. So, 6 # 6 = 2 because they share both prime factors 2 and 3.

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Although normally we would go from left to right, the new order of operations mandates that we work out the prime factor counting next. The prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. There are no shared prime factors, so 2#3 = 0:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Now, remembering that subtraction is resolved before concatenation, we subtract 0 from 12 to get:

6 @ 18 + 12

Finally, we perform the concatenation and addition operations, going from left to right:

618 + 12 = 630

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

First according to the order of operations, we need to do the Prime Factor Counting (F).

The prime factors of 4 are [2], and the prime factors of 3 are [3].  Hence there are no shared prime factors.

So 4#3 = 0. 

Therefore, the expression becomes 0 + 2.

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

The steps to solve this, according to the order of operations PEFMDASC, would be:

Step 1: We check for Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting, and Multiplication/Division. None of these are present.

Step 2: Solve Addition: We have the addition operation in our expression. Therefore, we need to perform the addition before we move to the next operation.
So, 5 + 2 = 7. Therefore, the expression becomes 7 @ 4. 

Step 3: Perform Concatenation which is the final operation according to PEFMDASC. This operation combines these numbers as if attaching them one after the other: 
So, 7 @ 4 = 74.

Therefore, the answer is 74."

Given Expression: 8 # 2+6 # 6. 

First step (Prime Factor Counting (F)):

As per the PEFMDASC, we need to do Prime Factor Counting (F) operations first (if there are no Parentheses (P) or Exponents (E)). So, we'll evaluate 8 # 2 and 6 # 6:

Prime factors of 8 are 2, and prime factors of 2 are also 2. Hence, 8 # 2 is equal to 1 since they share the prime factor 2. 

So now, 8 # 2+6 # 6 becomes 1 + 6 # 6.

Now let's evaluate 6 # 6.
The prime factor of 6 is 2 and 3. Since we are comparing the same numbers, all the prime factors are shared. Hence, 6 # 6 is equal to 2 because 6 has 2 unique prime factors.

Then the expression becomes 1 + 2

Second Step (Addition (A)): 
Following PEFMDASC, we now have an Addition operation. We perform the operation 1 + 2, which equals 3. 

So, finally, we have solved the given expression and its result is 3.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: First, according to our new order of operations PEFMDASC, we should compute what is inside the Parentheses:

14 + 4 = 18

So, the expression simplifies to 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3.

Next, in PEFMDASC, 'F' comes before 'A' and 'S'. So, we have to calculate the Prime Factor Counting operation 2#3:

2#3 = 1 (since the prime factors of |2| = {2} and the prime factors of |3| = {3}, they share only 1 common prime factor '2')

So, the expression simplifies to 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1. 

Next, 'A' and 'S' comes before 'C', so we evaluate addition and subtraction from left to right:

18 + 12 = 30 

and 

30 - 1 = 29

Our expression now becomes 6 @ 29.

Lastly, we apply the concatenation operation to get the final answer.

So, 6 @ 29 = 629.

The answer is 629."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

Step 1: We calculate 3 # 2. The prime factors of 3 are 3 and prime factors of 2 are 2. There are no common prime factors, so the Prime Factor Counting (F) is 0. So, we get 5 + 0.

Step 2: Now, we can do the addition. Therefore, 5 + 0 equals 5.
