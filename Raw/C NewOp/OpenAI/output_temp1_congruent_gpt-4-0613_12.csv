According to the newly defined order of operations (PEFMDASC), addition operation should be evaluated before concatenation operation. So, we perform the operation 5 + 2 first. 

5 + 2 = 7

Now, the remaining problem to solve is 7 @ 4. 

Performing the concatenation operation 7 @ 4:

7 @ 4 = 74

We find that the prime factors of 8 are 2.
The prime factors of 2 are also 2.
Therefore, we find they share 1 prime factor.

Substituting this back into our original equation 8#2 + 6#6 we get:

1 + 6#6

Next, we calculate the prime factors of 6. 6 has two prime factors: 2 and 3.

Therefore, 6#6 results in a count of 2 prime factors because we count the unique prime numbers that 6 is composed of.

After substituting this result into our equation we have:

systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: We follow the order of operations as defined by PEFMDASC. 

We first look for any parentheses: 

6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3

The expression inside parentheses (14+4) = 18. 

Now, our expression looks like: 6@18 + 12-2 # 3.

Next, we perform the operations in this order - exponents (E), prime factor counting (F), multiplication and division (M and D), and addition and subtraction (A and S), before finally, concatenation (C).

There are no exponents here. 

Then we perform prime factor counting:

2 # 3 = 0 (2 and 3 are prime numbers and have no shared prime factors).

So, now the expression is: 6@18 + 12 - 0

Next, we perform the multiplication and division operations. There are none in this expression.

We then proceed to perform Addition and Subtraction:

6@18 + 12 - 0 = 6@18 + 12 = 6@30

Now, only the concatenation is remaining:

6@18 @ 30 = 61830

Therefore, the final answer is 61830."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

systemPrompt3_userPrompt2_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Given this problem, the first step is to calculate the prime factor counting operations, since these come before addition in the updated order of operations PEFMDASC.

To do this, we'll perform 8#2 and 6#6.

8#2 gives us 1. The prime factors of 8 are 2 while the prime factors of 2 are 2 also giving us 1 common prime factor. 

6#6 gives us 2. Because the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and since 6 is being compared to itself, it has 2 common prime factors.

Our equation is now 1 + 2.

To complete the problem, we add 1 and 2 which equals 3.

The answer is 3."

The operation here involves Prime Factor Counting and Addition which means we have to carry out the Prime Factor Counting operation first before the Addition operation.

Step 1: Count the common prime factors in 4 and 3. The prime factor of 4 is 2 and the prime factor of 3 is 3. They have no common factors. So, we have 0.

So, 4 # 3 equals 0.

Step 2: Now, we add the result to 2.

The operation involved in this expression are addition and prime factor counting.

Keeping in mind the order of operations, you need to do F (Prime Factor Counting) before A (Addition). 

So, let's first find 3 # 2.

Prime factor counting (#) determines the number of unique prime factors common to two numbers. 

The prime factor of 3 is 3 itself and the prime factor of 2 is 2 itself, so there are no prime factors shared by 2 and 3. Hence, 3#2 equals 0.

Applying this result to the expression, we find:

5 + 3#2 = 5 + 0

So, the final result is 5.

The answer is 5."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, using PEFMDASC order, handle the Parentheses first:

6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3
= 6@18 + 12-2 # 3
= 6@(18+12) - 2 # 3 (using the rule of Addition and Subtraction left to right)
= 6@30 - 2 # 3 

Next, we execute the Concatenation (C) operation:

= 630 - 2 # 3 

Then we calculate Prime Factor Counting (F):

= 630 - 1 (since the absolute value of 3 (which is 3 itself) only has one prime factor, that is 3 itself, and 2 has only one prime factor, which is 2 itself, so there are no shared prime factors)

Finally, we subtract:

= 629 

So, the solution is:

The answer is 629."
