gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: First, we need to follow the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
4. Multiplication and Division (L to R)
5. Addition and Subtraction (L to R)
6. Concatenation (C) (L to R)

The given expression is 5 + 2 @ 4.

According to the order of operations, we need to evaluate the concatenation after the addition, because concatenation (C) comes last in the order.

So, let's first evaluate the addition:

5 + 2 = 7

Now, we simply concatenate the result with the next number using the concatenation operation:

7 @ 4 = 74 (since 7 and 4 are simply being joined together at the digit level)

Thus, the final answer to the expression is 74.

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we apply the extended order of operations PEFMDASC.

The problem given is:
8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Let's break it down step by step:

Prime Factor Counting (F):
- 8 # 2: We find the prime factors of the absolute values of 8 and 2.
  The prime factorization of 8 is \(2 \times 2 \times 2\), and for 2, it is simply 2.
  They share one prime factor, which is 2, so 8 # 2 = 1.
- 6 # 6: The prime factorization of 6 is \(2 \times 3\).
  Since it's comparing with itself, it has shared prime factors of 2 and 3, resulting in 6 # 6 = 2.

Now we rewrite the expression with these evaluated results:
1 + 2

Addition (A):
- Finally, we perform the addition:
  1 + 2 = 3.

So the final answer to the problem is 3, and we write it as:
The answer is 3."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation before addition, as per the order of operations (PEFMDASC).

4#3:
The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
The prime factor of 3 is 3.
Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, 4 # 3 equals 0.

Now, the expression reduces to:

0 + 2.

This is a simple addition, resulting in:

2.

Therefore, the answer to the problem is:
The answer is 2."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Let's break down the given problem step by step, following the new PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. **(P) Parentheses:** We evaluate any expressions within parentheses first.
2. **(E) Exponents:** Next, we would evaluate any exponents if they were present, but there are none in this problem.
3. **(F) Prime Factor Counting:** After parentheses, we would consider the prime factor counting operation.
4. **(M) Multiplication and (D) Division:** Then, we'd do multiplication or division from left to right.
5. **(A) Addition and (S) Subtraction:** Next, we'd handle addition or subtraction from left to right.
6. **(C) Concatenation:** Finally, we perform any concatenation operations.

Now let's apply these to the problem:

Given Problem: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

Step 1: (P) Parentheses
Evaluate any expressions inside parentheses first:
(14 + 4) = 18

The equation becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: (F) Prime Factor Counting
Since there are no exponents, we move onto prime factor counting:
2#3 will count the number of unique prime factors shared between 2 and 3. Since 2 is only divisible by itself and 3 is also only divisible by itself, there are no shared prime factors.
2#3 = 0

The equation becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3: (A) Addition 
There is no operation of Multiplication or Division to be performed; we move to Addition and Subtraction:
18 + 12 = 30
There is a subtraction operation present but we perform addition first.

The equation becomes:
6 @ 30 - 0

Step 4: (S) Sub"
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: First, we apply the order of operations PEFMDASC. In this case, there are no parentheses (P) or exponents (E) to consider, so we first handle the Prime Factor counting operation (F).

For the expression 5 + 3 # 2, we calculate 3 # 2 first.

3 # 2 evaluates to the count of unique prime factors shared by 3 and 2.

The prime factor of 3 is just 3, and the prime factor of 2 is just 2. Since they do not share any common prime factors, 3 # 2 is 0.

So the expression becomes:

5 + (3 # 2) becomes 5 + 0

The next operation is addition (A), so we then add 5 and 0.

5 + 0 equals 5.

Therefore, the final answer is ""The answer is 5."""
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: Let's apply the newly updated order of operations PEFMDASC (Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction, Concatenation) to the expression 5 + 2 @ 4.

Looking at the expression, we have addition and concatenation. According to the order of operations, addition and subtraction (A/S) come before concatenation (C). So we must perform the addition before the concatenation:

1. Perform the addition:
   \( 5 + 2 = 7 \)

2. Then, perform the concatenation with the result and the next number:
   \( 7 @ 4 \)
   Concatenating the digits of 7 and 4 gives us:
   \( 74 \)

Step 1: Evaluate prime factor counting ('F'), which comes before addition ('A'):

8 has the prime factors 2 x 2 x 2 (or \( 2^3 \)) and 2 is its own prime factor. The shared prime factor is 2, so 8 # 2 = 1.

6 has the prime factors 2 x 3 and 6 has the same prime factors, so 6 # 6 = 2 (they share two prime factors: 2 and 3).

1. Parentheses (P)
2. Exponents (E)
3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D, left to right)
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S, left to right)
6. Concatenation (C, left to right)

The given problem is:
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2#3

Step 1: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first.
6 @ (18) + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: Apply the prime factor counting.
The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
The prime factors of 3 are just 3.
Therefore, there are no shared prime factors, and 2#3 is 0.
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3: Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.
6 @ 18 + 12
After addition we have:
6 @ 18 + 12 = 6 @ 30

Step 4: Apply the concatenation operation.
For concatenation, we simply combine the digits of 6 and 30 since they don't exceed a single digit each. So 6 @ 30 = 630.

Step 5: Complete any remaining addition or subtraction.
630 + 12 = 642

2. Addition (A): Then perform the addition since it comes after prime factor counting in the order of operations.

Let's start with the first operation:

8 # 2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or 2^3). The prime factors of 2 are just 2. They share the prime factor 2, so there is 1 unique shared prime factor.

8 # 2 = 1

Next,

6 # 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since the numbers are the same, they share the same prime factors, but we are counting unique prime factors, so they share 2 unique prime factors, 2 and 3.

6 # 6 = 2

6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

Firstly, we evaluate the expression inside the parentheses (P):

The expression is now:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

We proceed with addition and subtraction (A/S):
12 - 0 = 12

Now the expression is:
6 @ 18 + 12

Finally, since Concatenation (C) is the last operation in our order, we perform it left to right:

1. Prime Factor counting (F)
2. Addition (A)

First, we need to find the count of unique prime factors shared between the numbers involved in the prime factor counting operations.

Step 1: Evaluate 8 # 2
The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or 2^3).
The prime factors of 2 are 2.
The shared prime factors of 8 and 2 are just one number: 2.
So, 8 # 2 = 1.

Step 2: Evaluate 6 # 6
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
The shared prime factors of 6 and 6 are the same numbers: 2 and 3.
So, 6 # 6 = 2 (since there are two unique shared prime factors).

Now that we've evaluated the prime factor counting, we move on to addition.

Step 3: Add the results of the prime factor counting operations
1 (from 8 # 2) + 2 (from 6 # 6) = 3.

The given expression is:
6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
First, we evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:
(14+4) = 18

So the expression becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents to evaluate in this expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor counting (F)
Next, we count the prime factors of 2 and 3:
- The prime factors of 2 are 2.
- The prime factors of 3 are 3.
There are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3, hence:
2#3 = 0

So the expression is now:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
There is no multiplication or division to carry out in this expression.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
We would typically perform addition and subtraction in this step, but we should address the Concatenation (C) operation before performing any addition or subtraction because concatenation comes after all addition and subtraction based on the updated order of operations.

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
Now, we concatenate 6 and 18:
6 @ 18 = 618

So we now have:
618 + 12 - 0

Step 7: Finish Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Finally, we can perform the addition and subtraction:
618 + 12 = 630
630 - 0 = 630
