gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: According to the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to apply concatenation (C) after addition (A), since addition comes before concatenation in the order. 

Let's apply that to the given problem:

5 + 2 @ 4

We must perform the addition before the concatenation:

= 7 @ 4

Now we can proceed with the concatenation of 7 and 4:

= 74

Therefore, the final answer is 74.

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 based on the new order of operations PEFMDASC, follow the steps:

1. (P) Parentheses: There are no parentheses in the expression, so move on to the next step.
2. (E) Exponents: There are no exponents in the expression, so move on to the next step.
3. (F) Prime Factor Counting (Prime Factor Counting operation is evaluated before addition or subtraction):
    - Calculate 8 # 2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or 2^3), and the prime factors of 2 are just 2. The shared prime factor is 2, so the result is 1 (since they share the prime factor 2 only once).
    - Calculate 6 # 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since both numbers are the same, they share all their prime factors. However, we just count the distinct prime factors once, so the result is 2 (they share both prime factors 2 and 3).

So the expression becomes:
8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 2

4. (M) Multiplication: There is no multiplication in this expression.
5. (D) Division: There is no division in this expression.
6. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction: Now, it's time to perform the addition:
1 + 2 = 3

7. (C) Concatenation: There is no concatenation operation to be performed as the last step.

Therefore, the final answer to the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 is 3.

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: According to the new conventions, we must first consider the Prime Factor counting operation (#) before addition:

Let's evaluate the problem:

\( 4 # 3 + 2 \)

First, calculate the Prime Factor counting (F):
- The prime factors for 4 are 2 twice, but unique prime factors are only counted once, so we have 2.
- The prime factors for 3 is 3.
- These two numbers do not share any prime factors. So, the result of \( 4 # 3 \) is 0.

Now, with that result, we can proceed with the addition (A):
\( 0 + 2 = 2 \)

Thus, the final answer is:
The answer is 2."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Let's take this step by step according to the PEFMDASC order of operations:

Given expression: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

1. (P) Parentheses:
First, we calculate the sum inside the parentheses.
14 + 4 = 18
  
2. (E) Exponents:
There are no exponents in the given expression.

3. (F) Prime Factor Counting:
Next, we perform the prime factor counting operation.
The prime factors of 2 are {2}, and for 3, they are {3}. Since they do not share any prime factors:
2 # 3 = 0

4. (M) Multiplication:
There is no multiplication operation that needs to be performed at the moment.

5. (D) Division:
There is no division in this expression. 

6. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction:
According to the order, we take care of the subtraction that includes the prime factor counting operation:
12 - 2#3
12 - 0
= 12

At this stage, our expression becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12

Now, we perform the addition since it comes before the concatenation (C):
6 @ 18 + 12
= 6 @ (18 + 12)
= 6 @ 30
Note that inside the parentheses, 18 and 12 are added before concatenation, according to the order of operations.

7. (C) Concatenation:
Lastly, we perform the concatenation:
6 @ 30
= 630

Putting it all together, we have:

The answer is 630."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: According to the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to apply the Prime Factor Counting operation before addition. 

Calculating the prime factors of the numbers:
- The prime factors of 5 are just 5 itself because it is a prime number.
- The prime factors of 2 are just 2 itself because it is a prime number.

Since 5 and 2 do not share any prime factors, their Prime Factor Counting operation (designated by '#') is 0.

So,

5 + 3 # 2
= 5 + (3 # 2)
= 5 + 0
= 5

Therefore, the final result of this expression is 5. 

The answer is 5."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: According to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first need to address any Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), and lastly, Concatenation (from left to right). Given the problem ""5 + 2@4"", there are no parentheses, exponents, prime factor counting, multiplication, or division to consider, so we move directly to addition and concatenation.

Here, we need to perform the concatenation before the addition because the concatenation operation has a lower precedence, despite typically evaluating addition before concatenation in classical order. This is a change from the normal operations due to the new definition given by the new order of operations rules provided.

So first, we concatenate 2 and 4, which is simply putting the digits together:

2 @ 4 = 24

Now, we add 5 to the concatenated result:

5 + 24 = 29

Thus, the result of the operation is 29.

The answer is 29."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: Let's evaluate the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F) comes before addition (A), so we need to evaluate both 8 # 2 and 6 # 6 first.
2. 8 has prime factors of 2 (as 8 = 2^3), and 2 itself is prime.
   The number of unique prime factors shared by 8 and 2 is 1 (since both have the prime factor 2). Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1.
3. 6 has prime factors of 2 and 3 (as 6 = 2 * 3).
   The number of unique prime factors shared by 6 and 6 is 2 (since the prime factors are 2 and 3 for both numbers). Therefore, 6 # 6 = 2 (since there are two shared prime factors, 2 and 3).
4. So the expression now simplifies to 1 + 2.
5. The last operation is addition (A), so we add 1 and 2 together.

Calculating the final result:

1 + 2 = 3

Therefore, the answer is 3."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: To evaluate the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the newly updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to execute the operations in the correct sequence.

Firstly, we need to consider the Prime Factor counting (F) operation.
We know that the prime factors of 4 are 2 (since 4 = 2 * 2), and the prime factors of 3 are 3 (since 3 = 3 * 1).

The prime factors of 4: 2
The prime factors of 3: 3

There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so:

4 # 3 = 0

Next, we perform addition (A):

0 + 2 = 2

So the final result is 2.

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Let's follow the updated order of operations, PEFMDASC, to solve the given expression:

6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

First, we deal with Parentheses (P):
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2#3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Next, we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F):
2#3 is the count of unique prime factors shared by 2 and 3. Since 2 is only divisible by itself and 1, and 3 is only divisible by itself and 1, they have no shared prime factors.
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

The next operations are Multiplication and Division (M/D), but there are none in this expression. The same goes for Addition and Subtraction (A/S) - there are no immediate pairs of these operations before or after Concatenation (C).

Therefore, we proceed to Concatenation (C):
6 @ 18
= 618 (Concatenate the digits of 6 and 18)

Now we perform Addition and Subtraction (A/S):
618 + 12 - 0
= 630 - 0
= 630

Since we have completed all operations, the final answer is:
The answer is 630."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: To evaluate the expression 5 + 3 # 2 using the newly updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to execute the operations in the correct sequence.

Firstly, we need to consider the Prime Factor counting (F) before moving to Addition (A). Let's start by evaluating the prime factor counting (3 # 2):

3 # 2 means we need to count the number of unique prime factors shared between the numbers 3 and 2. The prime factors of 3 are {3}, and the prime factors of 2 are {2}. There are no shared prime factors, hence:

3 # 2 = 0

Now we can proceed with the addition, since we have finished evaluating the prime factor counting:

5 + 0 = 5

Thus, the final answer is:

The answer is 5."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: Firstly, we apply the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

- Parentheses
- Exponents
- Prime Factor Counting
- Multiplication and Division (left to right)
- Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
- Concatenation (left to right)

Following the rules (and since there are no parentheses, exponents, prime factor countings, multiplications, or divisions in this expression), we start with the addition:

5 + 2

Then we move on to concatenation with the result of the addition and 4.

Since addition precedes concatenation, we first calculate:

5 + 2 = 7

Now we concatenate the result with 4:

7@4 = 74

The final result is:

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: First, let's evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operations before we perform any addition (A), since the new order of operations is PEFMDASC.

For the first operation, 8 # 2:

8 = 2^3 (The prime factors of 8 are a threefold of 2)
2 = 2 (The only prime factor of 2 is 2)
The unique common prime factor between 8 and 2 is just one number, 2. So:
8 # 2 = 1

Now, for the second operation, 6 # 6:

6 = 2 * 3 (The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3)
6 = 2 * 3 (Same prime factors for this 6)
All the prime factors of the first 6 are common with the second 6, but we only count unique common factors once, so the answer is 2 (since both 2 and 3 are common and unique):

6 # 6 = 2

Now let's put it together and perform addition according to PEMDASCO:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6
= 1 + 2
= 3

The answer is 3."

Operations in detail:
4#3: We need to count the unique prime factors common to 4 and 3.

- The prime factor of 4 is 2 (since 4 = 2 x 2).
- The prime factor of 3 is 3.
Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, the result of 4#3 is 0.

Now the expression becomes:
0 + 2

Now perform the Addition (A):
0 + 2 equals 2.

So, the final answer is 2.

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Let's evaluate the given mathematical expression following the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

We start with parentheses first (P):
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2#3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Next, we do the prime factor counting (F):
Since the prime factors of 2 are only 2 and the prime factors of 3 are only 3, they do not share any common prime factors.
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Now, we look for multiplication and division (M/D), which we don't have in this case. After that, we do addition and subtraction (A/S):
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0
= 6 @ 18 + 12
= 6 @ 30 (since we must add before concatenation)

Finally, we do the concatenation (C):
6 @ 30
= 630

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 630."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: Firstly, we apply the order of operations PEFMDASC. There are no parentheses (P) or exponents (E) to evaluate in this expression, but we do have a Prime Factor Counting operation (F) to perform before addition (A).

We look at 3#2, which represents Prime Factor Counting. We find the unique prime factors of 3 and 2:

- The prime factors of 3 are just 3 itself.
- The prime factors of 2 are just 2 itself.

Since there are no shared prime factors, the result of 3#2 is 0.

Now the expression simplifies to:

5 + (3 # 2)

Since Concatenation is the next operation to perform, we join the digits of 7 and 4 together.

7 @ 4 = 74

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: Let's solve the given expression step by step, following the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

Given expression: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
We need to calculate the count of unique prime factors shared between 8 and 2, as well as between 6 and 6.

The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (2^3), and the prime factors of 2 are just 2.
The shared prime factors between 8 and 2 are: 2 (count is 1).

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. For 6 and 6, the shared prime factors are the same (2 and 3), but we only count unique prime factors, so the count is 2.

Step 2: Replace the counts from Prime Factor Counting in the expression
Replacing the counts from Prime Factor Counting, we get:
1 + 2

Step 3: Addition (A)
Perform the addition operation:
1 + 2 = 3

The final answer to the expression is 3."

Given expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
We first solve the expression within the parentheses (14 + 4).

6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we calculate the prime factor counting operation (2 # 3). The prime factors of 2 are {2} and of 3 are {3}. They do not share any prime factors.

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3: Multiplication/Division (M/D)
There is no multiplication or division to perform in the expression.

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Addition/Subtraction (A/S)
We now perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0
= 6 @ 30 - 0 (adding 18 and 12)
= 6 @ 30 (subtracting 0 doesn't change the value)

Step 5: Concatenation (C)
Finally, we carry out the concatenation operation (6 @ 30). Since the first number is 6 and the second is 30, we simply join the digits together.

630 (6 concatenated with 30)
