1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Prime Factor counting (#)
4. Multiplication (M) and Division (D) (Left to Right)
5. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S) (Left to Right)
6. Concatenation (@) (Left to Right)

Given the problem has addition and concatenation, we should first perform the addition, and then perform the concatenation.

Calculate 5 + 2:
\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \]

Now we concatenate the result with 4 using the @ operation:
\[ 7 @ 4 \]

According to the rules of the concatenation operation, we join the numbers at the digit level:
\[ 7 @ 4 = 74 \]

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the problem, we evaluate it using the new order of operations PEFMDASC.

Given the expression:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6

We first look for operations within parentheses; there are none.

We then look for exponents; there are none.

Next, we look for Prime Factor Counting (F).

8 # 2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2. The prime factors of 2 are just 2. They share the prime factor 2. So, 8 # 2 = 1 because they share one unique prime factor (2).

6 # 6: The prime factors of the first 6 are 2 and 3. The prime factors of the second 6 are also 2 and 3. They share two unique prime factors (2 and 3). So, 6 # 6 = 2 because they share two unique prime factors.

Then, we move to Multiplication and Division; there are none.

Next, Addition and Subtraction:

1 + 2: Add the results from the prime factor counting.

Finally, Concatenation; there are none in this problem.

Putting it together, we get:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6
= (1) + (2)
= 3

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem ""4 # 3 + 2"" using the newly updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we would proceed as follows:

1. (P) Parentheses: There are no parentheses to evaluate in this expression.
2. (E) Exponents: There are no exponents to evaluate in this expression.
3. (F) Prime Factor Counting: We evaluate the prime factor counting operation first before any other operations like addition or concatenation.

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (or just 2, if we consider unique prime factors). The prime factors of 3 are just 3. Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, the result of the prime factor counting operation is:

4 # 3 = 0

4. (M) Multiplication: No multiplication to evaluate.
5. (D) Division: No division to evaluate.
6. (A) Addition: Now we perform the addition.
7. (S) Subtraction: No subtraction to evaluate.
8. (C) Concatenation: No concatenation to evaluate.

So incorporating our result from the prime factor counting operation, the expression becomes:

0 + 2

Now we evaluate the addition to get the final result:

0 + 2 = 2

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: Let's evaluate the expression using the expanded order of operations PEFMDASC:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

First, we handle the parenthesis (P):
6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 # 3

Then, we look for any exponents (E), but there are none.

Next is the prime factor counting (F):
2 # 3 involves counting the unique prime factors shared between 2 and 3. Since 2 and 3 are primes themselves and they are different, they do not share any prime factors.
So it becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Now, thereâ€™s no multiplication (M) or division (D) to do, so we move on to addition (A) and subtraction (S). These are performed left to right:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 = 6 @ 30 - 0 = 6 @ 30 = 630 - 0 = 630

Finally, we handle the concatenation (C), but since we have already processed the only concatenation operation when we did the addition, the expression is entirely simplified.

So, the final answer after evaluating the given mathematics problem:

Starting with the expression:

5 + 3 # 2

There are no parentheses or exponents to consider, so we begin by applying the prime factor counting operation.

3 # 2 means to count the unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 3 and 2. The absolute value of 3 is 3, and its prime factors are just 3. The absolute value of 2 is 2, and its prime factors are just 2. Since there are no shared prime factors, 3 # 2 equals 0.

So the expression becomes:

Following this order:

1. There are no parentheses to evaluate first.

3. There is no prime factor counting to be done.
4. No multiplication or division present.
5. We encounter an addition operation and a concatenation operation. According to the updated order of operations, addition (A) comes before concatenation (C).

So first, we perform the addition:

\( 5 + 2 = 7 \)

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first address the Prime Factor Counting (F) operations before moving on to addition (A).

The numbers involved are 8 and 2 for the first # operation, and 6 for both parts of the second # operation.

First, we determine the prime factors:

- The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or \(2^3\)).
- The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
- The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.

Now, let's compute the # operation results:

1. \(8 # 2\):
Since both 8 and 2 share the prime factor 2, the number of unique shared prime factors is 1.

2. \(6 # 6\):
Since the numbers are identical, the count will include all unique prime factors of 6, which are 2 and 3. So, it has 2 unique prime factors.

Now we can do the addition:

\(1 + 2 = 3\).

Using the updated order of operations, the calculation is as follows:

\(8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 2 = 3\).

The answer is 3."

Following this order, we have to evaluate the Prime Factor Counting before performing the addition.

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (or simply 2 since we are looking at primes), and the prime factors of 3 is 3. Since 4 and 3 don't share any prime factors, the Prime Factor Counting operation yields \( 0 \).

Now we calculate:

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem, we will follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

First, evaluate what is inside the parentheses (P):
\( (14 + 4) \)
\( = 18 \)

Next, we need to evaluate the concatenation (C) since there are no exponents (E), prime factor counting (F), multiplication (M), division (D), addition (A), or subtraction (S) inside the parentheses:
\( 6 @ 18 \)
\( = 6 @ 18 \)
\( = 618 \)

After evaluating the contents of the parentheses and resolving concatenation, we proceed with the remaining operations:
\( 618 + 12 - 2 # 3 \)

Next, we apply prime factor counting (F):
\( 2 # 3 \)
Both numbers are prime, so they don't share any prime factors:
\( = 0 \)

Also, notice that there was an error in the example provided regarding prime factor counting (F). The prime factors of 16 are not 2 and 5 as stated. They are just 2, being \( 2^4 \). And the prime factors of 4 are also just 2, that is \( 2^2 \). Therefore, the count of unique prime factors shared by 16 and 4 should be 1, not 0 as indicated in the example.

Returning to our current operation, we continue with the addition (A) and subtraction (S):
\( 618 + 12 - 0 \)
\( = 630 - 0 \)
\( = 630 \)

Putting it all together with the correct order of operations and adjusting for the incorrect example provided, the final answer is:

\( 3 \# 2 \)

The prime factor of 3 is 3, and the prime factor of 2 is 2. Since they have no prime factors in common, the result of the prime factor counting between 3 and 2 is:
\( 3 \# 2 = 0 \)

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: Let's break down the given mathematics problem by applying the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

The problem is: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
- 8 has prime factors of 2 (2^3).
- 2 has prime factors of 2 (2^1).
- 6 has prime factors of 2 and 3 (2 * 3).

8 # 2 counts the number of unique prime factors they share, which is just 1 (the factor 2).
6 # 6 counts the number of unique prime factors they share, which again is just 1 (the prime factors are 2 and 3, but since we're dealing with the same number, it only counts once).

So we have:
8 # 2 = 1 (because 2 is the shared prime factor)
6 # 6 = 1 (because 2 and 3 are shared, but since it's with itself, it only counts once)

Step 2: Addition (A)
Now we perform the addition operation with the results from Prime Factor Counting.
1 + 1 = 2

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Let's solve this step-by-step:

(i) Evaluate parentheses (P):
6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 # 3
The parentheses just simplify to 18, which is the sum of 14 and 4.

(ii) Evaluate prime factor counting (F):
6 @ 18 + 12 - (2 # 3)
Prime factors of 2 are 2. Prime factors of 3 are 3. They do not share any prime factors.
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0
We substitute 0 for the prime factor counting operation.

(iii) Evaluate the remaining operations in the proper order, considering that there are no exponents (E), multiplication (M), or division (D) in the expression. So, we now evaluate the addition/subtraction (A/S) and then concatenation (C):

6 @ 18 + 12
Since we evaluate addition before concatenation, let's add 12 to the result of the prime factor counting:
6 @ 18 + 12 = 6 @ (18 + 12)
6 @ 30
Next, perform the concatenation operation:
6 @ 30 = 630

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): We first evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operations in the expression.
