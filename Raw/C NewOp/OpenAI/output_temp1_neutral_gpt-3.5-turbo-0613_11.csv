systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

First, we evaluate the prime factor counting (F). 

8 has prime factors of 2 (2 * 2 * 2) and 
2 has prime factors of 2. 
So the shared prime factor is 2, and we have 1 common prime factor.

6 has prime factors of 2 and 3, and 
6 also has prime factors of 2 and 3. 
So the shared prime factors are 2 and 3, and we have 2 common prime factors.

Next, we add the results (A/S).

First, we evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation. The prime factors of 5 are 5, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since there are no common prime factors between 5 and 3, the result of 5 # 3 is 0.

Next, we perform the addition (A) operation. 5 + 0 = 5.

Step 2: There are no parentheses or exponents, so we move to the next step.
Step 3: Evaluate the prime factor counting operation. Since there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 4, the result is 0.

Step 1: Evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F)
Evaluate ""4 # 3"" first since it appears before the addition operation.

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
The prime factors of 3 are 3.

The shared prime factors between 4 and 3 are only 2.
So, ""4 # 3"" equals 1.

After evaluating the prime factor counting operation, the expression becomes:
1 + 2

Step 2: Evaluate the addition operation (A)
Now, we can add 1 and 2 together.

1 + 2 equals 3.

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.
                    It's crucial to get this right for accurate calculations.

                    = 20 @ 42 = 2042. (concatenation is last)

                    * Do Not assume traditional order of operations (PEMDAS); use the updated PEFMDASC instead.
                    * Avoid skipping steps or assuming familiarity with the new operations.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 using the new operations and the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we will follow the steps below:

Step 1: Parentheses
We start by evaluating the expression inside the parentheses:
14 + 4 = 18

The expression becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we calculate the shared prime factors between 2 and 3:
2 # 3 = 1

The expression becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

Step 3: Concatenation (C)
Now, we proceed with the concatenation operation:
6 @ 18 = 618

The expression becomes:
618 + 12 - 1

Step 4: Addition and subtraction (A/S)
Finally, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right:
618 + 12 = 630
630 - 1 = 629

Therefore, the answer to the expression 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 is 629.
The answer is 629."

Step 1: Evaluate prime factor counting (#)
In this step, we need to find the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 3 and 2.

 Prime factors of 3: 3 (since 3 is a prime number)
 Prime factors of 2: 2 (since 2 is a prime number)

Since there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, the result of 3 # 2 is 0.

Step 2: Perform addition (+)
Now that we have evaluated the prime factor counting operation (#), we can move on to the addition operation (+).

5 + 0 = 5
