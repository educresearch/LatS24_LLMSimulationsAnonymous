Parentheses - P: In the given expression, we need to handle the operation within the Parentheses first: (14 + 4).<br>    So, 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 becomes:<br>    6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3<br><br>2. Exponents and Prime factor counting - E & F: We do not have any Exponents in this expression, so we immediately move on to F where we need to evaluate the Prime factor counting operation: 2 # 3<br>    Since the prime factor of 2 is 2 and the prime factor of 3 is 3, there are no shared prime factors between these two numbers, so their Prime factor counting equals to 0. <br>    So, 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 becomes:<br>    6 @ 18 + 12 - 0<br><br>3.
