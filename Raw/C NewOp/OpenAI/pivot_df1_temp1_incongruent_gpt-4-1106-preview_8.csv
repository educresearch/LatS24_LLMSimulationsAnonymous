gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve the mathematics problem given the new operations and order of operations (PEFMDASC), let's carefully apply each step to the expression \[5 + 2@4\]:

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses to evaluate in this expression.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents to evaluate in this expression.
3. Prime Factor Counting: There are no prime factor counting operations to evaluate in this expression.
4. Multiplication/Division: There are no multiplication or division operations to evaluate in this expression.
5. Addition/Subtraction: Normally, you would perform addition before concatenation, but since addition and concatenation are separate operations, we need to follow the specific order given by the new operations.
6. Concatenation: According to our new order of operations, concatenation comes after addition.

The expression contains an addition operation and a concatenation operation. Following the new order of operations, we must perform the concatenation operation last.

Therefore, we first evaluate the concatenation:
\[2@4 = 24\]

Once the concatenation is resolved, we can add 5 to the result:
\[5 + 24 = 29\]

Thus, the final answer is \(29\), and hence, ""The answer is 29."""
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the given Mathematics problem following the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) before we perform the addition (A).

The Prime Factorization of the numbers:
- 8 is 2^3
- 2 is 2
- 6 is 2 x 3

Now we find the shared unique prime factors between each pair of numbers and count them:

1. 8 # 2: The shared unique prime factor is 2.
   So, 8 # 2 = 1 (since there's only one unique shared prime factor, which is 2)

2. 6 # 6: The shared unique prime factors are 2 and 3.
   However, since the question asks for the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b| and in this case |a| is equal to |b|, the prime factors are the same.
   Therefore, 6 # 6 = 2 (since there are two unique prime factors, 2 and 3)

Now we perform the addition:

(8 # 2) + (6 # 6) = 1 + 2 = 3

Thus, the final answer is ""The answer is 3."""
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the mathematics problem 4#3 + 2 using the new operations and order of operations (PEFMDASC), follow these steps:

1. (P) Parentheses – There are no parentheses to evaluate in this expression.
2. (E) Exponents – There are no exponents in this expression.
3. (F) Prime Factor counting – We need to evaluate 4#3 first because prime factor counting comes before addition.
    - The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (because 4 = 2 * 2).
    - The prime factors of 3 are just 3 (since 3 is a prime number).
    - They do not share any prime factors, so 4#3 = 0.

Now the expression becomes 0 + 2.

4. (M) Multiplication – There is no multiplication to perform.
5. (D) Division – There is no division to perform.

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: According to the newly defined order of operations PEFMDASC, we have to evaluate this expression in the following order:

1. Parentheses
2. Prime Factor Counting
3. Exponents (none in this case)
4. Multiplication and Division (none directly in our case)
5. Addition and Subtraction
6. Concatenation

Let’s evaluate the given expression 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3 step by step:

1. Start with solving the expression within the parentheses (14+4):
   (14+4) = 18

2. Now we need to handle Prime Factor Counting (2#3). The prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3; they do not share any common prime factors:
   2#3 = 0

3. There are no exponents, multiplication, or division operations to worry about within our current expression.

4. We need to evaluate the Addition (18 + 12) and Subtraction (12 - 0), but since Prime Factor Counting comes before both operations and affects the subtraction part of our expression, we'll need to perform that next:
   12 - 2#3 = 12 - 0 = 12

5. Now we can perform the addition (18 + 12):
   18 + 12 = 30

6. Finally, we perform the Concatenation (6 @ 30):
   6 @ 30 = 630

Putting all the steps together, the expression is evaluated as:
6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0
= 6 @ (18 + 12) - 0 (Since addition is before concatenation)
= 6 @ 30 - 0 (We have completed addition)

6. Concatenation (C)

Here’s the expression: 5 + 3 # 2

We start with the prime factor counting operation (#):

3 # 2 involves counting the shared unique prime factors of 3 and 2. 

The prime factor of 3 is 3, and the prime factor of 2 is 2. They do not share any prime factors.

So, 3 # 2 equals 0 because there are no shared prime factors.

Now we have: 5 + 0

Finally, we perform the addition:

5 + 0 = 5

Therefore, the answer to the problem is: ""The answer is 5."""

However, we do need to address the concatenation operation before the addition, as concatenation (C) comes after addition (A) in our new order.

Let's apply the operation of concatenation to 2 @ 4 first:

2 @ 4 = 24 (since concatenation merges the digits of |2| and |4|)

Now, we can add the result of the concatenation to 5:

5 + 24 = 29

The given expression:
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2#3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
We first need to resolve the expression within the parentheses (14 + 4).
(14 + 4) = 18

Now the expression becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents to evaluate in this expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
We then evaluate the prime factor counting operation, 2#3.
The prime factors of 2 are just 2, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3. Since they don't share any prime factors, the result is:
2#3 = 0

Now the expression becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication (M) and Division (D) (left to right)
There are no multiplication or division operations to evaluate.

Step 5: Addition (A) and Subtraction (S) (left to right)
We now perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right.
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

First, we perform the addition (18 + 12):
18 + 12 = 30

So the expression now is:
6 @ 30 - 0

Next, we perform the subtraction:
30 - 0 = 30

The expression now simplifies to:
6 @ 30

Step 6: Concatenation (C) (left to right)
Finally, we perform the concatenation operation:
6 @ 30 = 630

P: Parentheses
E: Exponents
F: Prime Factor Counting
M/D: Multiplication and Division (left to right)
A/S: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
C: Concatenation (left to right)

Since there are no parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, or concatenation operations present that need to be computed before prime factor counting, we will first perform the prime factor counting operation (\#).

The operation \( 3 \# 2 \) involves counting the number of unique prime factors shared by \( 3 \) and \( 2 \). Since \( 3 \) and \( 2 \) are both prime numbers and are not equal, they do not share any prime factors. Therefore, the result of \( 3 \# 2 \) is \( 0 \).

Now we substitute this result back into the original expression:

\( 5 + 3 \# 2 = 5 + 0 \)

Let's evaluate the expression step by step following the above rules.

The given expression is: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

Step 1: Parentheses
Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first:
14 + 4 = 18

Now the expression looks like this:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting
Next, we perform the prime factor counting operation:
Prime factors of 2 are just 2, and for 3 it's just 3. They have no prime factors in common.
2 # 3 = 0

The expression is now:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction
Since we don't have any exponents or multiplication/division, we move on to addition and subtraction:
12 - 0 = 12

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
We first look for prime factor counting operations in the expression.

8 # 2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2. The prime factors of 2 are only 2. The shared prime factor is 2, and since it's unique, we count it once.
Thus, 8 # 2 = 1 (as there is one shared prime factor: 2).

6 # 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since both numbers are the same, they share the same prime factors. However, we only count unique prime factors.
Thus, 6 # 6 = 2 (as there is two shared prime factors: 2 and 3).

Step 2: Replace Prime Factor Counting with Values
Now we replace the prime factor counting in the original expression with the values we found.

(8 # 2) + (6 # 6)
= 1 + 2

Step 3: Addition (A)

Now, let's follow these rules to solve the expression step by step:

Expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Evaluate what's inside the parentheses (P) first.
14 + 4 = 18

The expression becomes:

Step 2: Next, let's consider any exponents (E). There are no exponents in the expression. So we move on.

Step 3: Next, handle any Prime Factor Counting (F).
We have the operation 2 # 3. The prime factors of 2 are just 2 since it is a prime number, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3, since it is also a prime number. There are no shared prime factors, so this equals 0.
