5 + 2 @ 4

We apply the new order of operations: PEFMDASC (Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right, and finally Concatenation from left to right).

In this expression, we do not have any parentheses, exponents, or prime factor counting to consider. The operations present are addition and concatenation.

According to the order of operations, we should perform addition before concatenation. So, we first add 5 and 2, then apply the concatenation with 4.

5 + 2 = 7

Now we apply the concatenation with 7 and 4:

7 @ 4 = 74

The final result of the expression is 74.

1. Evaluate 8 # 2:
The absolute values of 8 and 2 are taken (though it doesn't matter in this case since both are positive), and then we determine the shared unique prime factors. The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or just 2 when considering unique factors). The prime factor of 2 is 2. Therefore, 8 and 2 share one unique prime factor, which is 2.

So, 8 # 2 = 1

2. Evaluate 6 # 6:
The absolute values of 6 and 6 are 6 and 6, and the unique prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since we're considering the same number, it has the same set of unique prime factors, so 6 and 6 share two unique prime factors: 2 and 3.

So, 6 # 6 = 2

3. Perform the addition:
Now that we have evaluated the prime factor counting, we can add the results together as per the order of operations.

1 + 2 = 3

- Parentheses
- Exponents
- Prime Factor Counting (F)
- Multiplication and Division (left to right)
- Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
- Concatenation (C)

Following this order:

1. Solve inside the parentheses (P):
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Now we look for prime factor counting (F):
Since prime factors of 2 are 2 and prime factors of 3 are 3, there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3.
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

3. Since there are no exponents, multiplication, or division to take care of, we now move on to addition and subtraction (A and S):
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0
= 6 @ 18 + 12
= 6 @ 30

4. Finally, we perform the concatenation operation (C):
6 @ 30
= 630

After applying all the operations in the correct order, we find the final answer to the given problem is 630.

The answer is 630."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
4. Multiplication/Division (M/D) (left to right)
5. Addition/Subtraction (A/S) (left to right)
6. Concatenation (C) (left to right)

Given expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Resolve parentheses (P)
\( 6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 # 3 \)

Step 2: There are no exponents to resolve (E).

Step 3: Perform prime factor counting (F)
\( 2 \) and \( 3 \) are the prime factors for \( 6 \). \( 2 # 3 \) means we are counting the number of unique prime factors shared by \( 2 \) and \( 3 \). Since \( 2 \) and \( 3 \) have no shared prime factors, this results in \( 0 \).
\( 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 \)

Steps 4 and 5: There is no multiplication or division to resolve (M/D), so perform addition/subtraction (A/S) (left to right)
\( 6 @ 18 + 12 \)
\( (6 @ 18) \) comes first due to concatenation being last in the order.
\( 6 @ 18 \) is the concatenation of \( 6 \) and \( 18 \), resulting in \( 618 \).
Now add \( 12 \) to it:
\( 618 + 12 = 630 \)

Thus, after performing addition, we have 630.

Step 6: There are no remaining concatenation operations to perform (C).

5 + 2 @ 4

According to the updated order of operations, Concatenation (C) comes after Addition and Subtraction (A/S). Therefore, we first perform the addition and then the concatenation:

Start with addition (5 + 2):
5 + 2 = 7

Now perform concatenation with the result of addition and 4 (7 @ 4):
7 @ 4 = 74 (since concatenation merges the digits)

Thus, 5 + 2 @ 4 = 74.

The answer is 74."

Using Prime Factor Counting (F), which comes after Parentheses (P) and Exponents (E) but before Multiplication and Division (M/D), and Addition and Subtraction (A/S):

8 # 2:
The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2.
The prime factors of 2 are 2.
The unique shared prime factor is 2.
Thus, 8 # 2 equals 1.

6 # 6:
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
Since both numbers are the same, they share the same prime factors.
Thus, 6 # 6 equals 2, because there are two prime factors in 6, and they are all shared.

First, we evaluate the prime factor counting:
- The prime factors of 3 are 3 itself (since 3 is prime).
- The prime factors of 2 are 2 itself (since 2 is prime).
There are no shared prime factors, so:

3 # 2 = 0

Remember, # denotes prime factor counting:
- For the number 8, the prime factors are 2, 2, and 2 (or \(2^3\)).
- For the number 2, the only prime factor is 2 itself.
- 8 # 2 counts the number of unique prime factors that 8 and 2 share, which is just one: the prime factor 2.
So, 8 # 2 equals 1 because they share one prime factor (the number 2).

Now let's look at the next part:
- For the number 6, the prime factors are 2 and 3.
- 6 # 6 also counts the number of unique prime factors that each 6 shares, which in this case will include both 2 and 3.
So, 6 # 6 equals 2 because 6 shares two prime factors with itself (the numbers 2 and 3).

The given expression is 4 # 3 + 2. There are no parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, or concatenation to process, so we start with the Prime Factor Counting (F):

Step 1: Evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F)
4 # 3
The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (since 4 is 2^2). The prime factor of 3 is 3. There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so 4 # 3 is 0.

Step 2: Process Addition
Now that we have evaluated the prime factor counting, we add the result to 2:
0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2."

1. 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

First, we have to solve what's inside the parentheses (P):

2. 14 + 4 = 18

Now the expression is:

3. 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we look for exponentiation (E), but the expression does not contain any exponents. Moving on to Prime Factor Counting (F):

4. 2 # 3

Both 2 and 3 are prime numbers and do not have any prime factors in common, so:

5. 2 # 3 = 0

Our expression now becomes:

6. 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Now we must check for multiplication (M) and division (D), but there are neither of these operations in our expression, so we move on to addition (A) and subtraction (S):

7. 18 + 12 = 30

So our expression is updated to:

8. 6 @ 30 - 0

Finally, we perform the Concatenation (C) and then the remaining subtraction:

9. 6 @ 30 = 630 (Concatenating the number 6 with 30 gives us 630)

10. 630 - 0 = 630

The answer is 630."

   - The absolute value of 3 is 3, which has a prime factor of 3.
   - The absolute value of 2 is 2, which has a prime factor of 2.
   - There are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2.
   - Therefore, 3 # 2 = 0.
