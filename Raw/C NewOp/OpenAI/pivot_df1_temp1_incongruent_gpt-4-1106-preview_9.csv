gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem 5 + 2 @ 4, we will follow the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. (P) Parentheses
2. (E) Exponents
3. (F) Prime Factor counting
4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)

Since there are no parentheses, exponents, or prime factor counting involved in this problem, we will move straight to the concatenation operation, which comes last in the order of operations.

According to the concatenation operation (C), 2 @ 4 is the concatenation of the numbers 2 and 4, so:

2 @ 4 = 24

Now we perform the addition:

5 + 24 = 29

Therefore, the final answer is 29.

The answer is 29."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: Let's solve the given expression using the new order of operations: PEFMDASC.

Given Expression: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): We start by evaluating the prime factor counting operations. Since 8 has prime factors 2 (2 x 2 x 2) and 2 is itself a prime, 8 # 2 results in a count of 1 shared prime factor (2). Similarly, 6 has prime factors 2 and 3, both of which do not match with itself being the prime factor counting with itself, so 6 # 6 results in a count of 0 shared prime factors.

So, 8 # 2 = 1
And 6 # 6 = 0

2. Addition (A): Next, we add the results from the prime factor counting operations.

The expression now becomes: 1 + 0

Simply adding those together: 1 + 0 = 1

There are no other operations to perform. Therefore, the final answer to the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 is 1.

The answer is 1."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem 4#3 + 2, we will follow the order of operations PEFMDASC.

First, we handle the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation before the Addition (A):
- For 4#3: The number 4 has prime factors of 2 (since 4 = 2^2). The number 3 is a prime in itself. Since 4 and 3 do not share any prime factors, the result of 4#3 is 0.

Next, we perform the Addition (A):
- 0 + 2 = 2

Therefore, the final answer to the problem is 2.

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Let's break down the given mathematics problem step by step using the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Parentheses (P)
2. Exponents (E)
3. Prime Factor counting (F)
4. Multiplication (M) and Division (D) (left to right)
5. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S) (left to right)
6. Concatenation (C) (left to right)

We have: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

Step 1: Parentheses
First, we will evaluate the expression within the parentheses (14+4):
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: There are no exponents in the expression, so we move on to the next operation.

Step 3: Prime Factor counting
Next, we calculate the prime factor counting of 2#3:
The prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. They do not share any common prime factors, so:
2#3 = 0

Now we have:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: There are no Multiplication and Division operations to perform, so we move on.

Step 5: Perform Addition and Subtraction
Prior to performing concatenation, we must perform the addition and subtraction:
18 + 12 - 0 = 30

Now the expression is:
6 @ 30

Step 6: Concatenation
Finally, we perform the Concatenation operation:
6 @ 30 = 630

The answer is 630."

First, we handle the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation before the Addition (A).

Prime Factor Counting (F):
- The prime factors of 3 are 3.
- The prime factors of 2 are 2.
Since they don't share any prime factors, 3 # 2 = 0.

Now we can proceed to the Addition (A):
- 5 + (3 # 2) = 5 + 0 = 5.

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 2 @ 4, we must follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC (Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction, Concatenation). 

According to the order, the operation of Addition (A) comes before Concatenation (C). Therefore, we must perform the addition operation before the concatenation.

Here is how we will evaluate the expression:

First, perform the addition of 5 and 2:
5 + 2 = 7

Now, perform the concatenation of the result with 4:
7 @ 4 = 74

The answer to 5 + 2 @ 4 is therefore 74.

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we evaluate each operation step by step.

Prime Factor Counting (F) comes before Addition (A) in the order of operations.

First, we need to find the Prime Factor Counting (F) of each pair of numbers:

8 has prime factors 2 (since 8 = 2^3).
2 has prime factors 2.

8 and 2 share the prime factor 2, so there's 1 unique prime factor shared between 8 and 2.

Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1.

Next,

6 has prime factors 2 and 3 (since 6 = 2 * 3).
Again, 6 has prime factors 2 and 3.

6 and 6 share the prime factors 2 and 3, so there are 2 unique prime factors shared between 6 and 6.

Therefore, 6 # 6 = 2.

Now, we can add the results of the Prime Factor Counting together:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6
= 1 + 2
= 3

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 3."

Here's how we apply the updated order of operations:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): We first identify the number of unique prime factors shared by |4| and |3|.

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (i.e., 2^2), and the prime factor of 3 is 3 itself. Since there are no shared prime factors, 4#3 will be 0.

2. Addition (A): We then add the result of the prime factor counting operation to 2: 

0 + 2 = 2

With no other operations left to perform, the final answer is 2.

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Let's solve the given mathematical problem step by step, following the newly updated order of operations: PEFMDASC.

The problem given is:  6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

First, we handle the parentheses (P):
6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 # 3

Then, we proceed with the Prime Factor Counting (F):
To find 2 # 3, we need to identify the prime factors of 2 and 3.
- 2 has the prime factor of 2.
- 3 has the prime factor of 3.
Since there are no shared prime factors, 2 # 3 = 0.

So the equation becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

We then proceed with Multiplication/Division (M/D), but since there is none, we move to Addition/Subtraction (A/S):

6 @ 18 + 12

Since we have no additions or subtractions to perform before the concatenation (C), we proceed with the concatenation:
6 @ 18 = 618

Now our equation is:
618 + 12

We perform the addition:
618 + 12 = 630

Therefore, the final answer is:

Here's how we apply the updated order of operations:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): We first identify the number of unique prime factors shared by |3| and |2|.

The prime factors of 3 are just 3 (since it's a prime number), and the prime factors of 2 are just 2 (since it's a prime number as well). Since there are no common prime factors between 3 and 2, the result of the prime factor counting operation 3 # 2 is 0.

2. Addition (A): We then add the result of the prime factor counting to 5.

The expression becomes: 5 + (3 # 2) = 5 + 0

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): There is addition, but it should be done after concatenation (C) according to the new rules.
6. Concatenation (C): We have to evaluate the concatenation first. So we evaluate 2@4.

2@4 = |2|@|4| = 24 (since concatenation merges the digits)

The answer is 29."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: Let's evaluate the given expression using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6

First, we look for parentheses and exponents, of which there are none.
Then, we apply the Prime Factor Counting operation (F):

8 # 2

The unique prime factors of 8 are 2 (since 8 = 2^3), and the unique prime factors of 2 is obviously 2. Since 2 is a common prime factor, we have:

8 # 2 = 1

Then, we calculate the next Prime Factor Counting operation:

6 # 6

The unique prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since both numbers are the same, the unique prime factors are indeed 2 and 3, so:

6 # 6 = 2 (since there are two shared prime factors: 2 and 3)

Now we have:

1 + 2

1 + 2 = 3

Starting with parentheses (P):

6 @ (18) + 12 - 2#3

Next is exponents (E), but there are no exponents in this problem, so we move on to prime factor counting (F):

2#3 is the number of unique prime factors common to 2 and 3. Since 2's prime factors are just 2 and 3's prime factors are just 3, there are no prime factors in common, so:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

We then proceed with multiplication/division (M/D), but there are none present in this expression. Then we do addition/subtraction (A/S):

6 @ 18 + 12

2. Prime Factor Counting (F):
   Now we do the prime factor counting: 2 # 3
   The prime factors of 2 are just 2, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3. 
   Since they have no shared prime factors, 2 # 3 = 0.

3. Concatenation (C):
