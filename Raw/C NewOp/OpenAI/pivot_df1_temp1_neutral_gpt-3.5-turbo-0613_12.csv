Given the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6:
Step 1: Calculate the prime factor counting for each number.
8 has prime factors 2 and 2, so it has 2 shared prime factors with itself.
2 has prime factor 2, so it also has 1 shared prime factor with itself.
6 has prime factors 2 and 3, so it has 0 shared prime factors with itself.
6 has prime factors 2 and 3, so it has 0 shared prime factors with itself.

After prime factor counting:
8 # 2 + 6 # 6 becomes 2 + 0.

Step 2: Perform the addition.
2 + 0 equals 2.
