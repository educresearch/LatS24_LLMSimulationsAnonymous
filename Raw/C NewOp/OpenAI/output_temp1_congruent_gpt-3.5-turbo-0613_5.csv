6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3
= 6@18 + 12-2  #  3

Next, we evaluate the concatenation operation:

6@18 + 12-2  #  3
= 618 + 12-2  #  3

After that, we perform the addition before the subtraction:

618 + 12-2  #  3

Next, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation:

30 - 2  #  3

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

systemPrompt3_userPrompt2_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations mentioned above. 

First, let's look at the expression: 
8 # 2 + 6 # 6 

According to the order of operations, we should start by evaluating the prime factor counting (F) operations. 

For 8 and 2:
8's prime factors are 2 and 2. 
2's prime factors are 2. 
So, the common prime factor between 8 and 2 is 2, giving us a result of 1 for the prime factor counting (8 # 2 = 1). 

For 6 and 6:
6's prime factors are 2 and 3. 
6's prime factors are 2 and 3. 
So, the common prime factors between 6 and 6 are 2 and 3, giving us a result of 2 for the prime factor counting (6 # 6 = 2). 

Now, we have the expression as: 
1 + 2 

Next, we move to addition and subtraction (A/S) from left to right. 

1 + 2 = 3 

Therefore, the final answer is 3. 

The answer is 3."

First, let's evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation. The prime factors of 5 are only 5 itself, and the prime factors of 3 are also 3 itself. Since there are no shared prime factors between 5 and 3, the result of 3 # 2 is 0.

Next, we move on to the addition (A) operation. The addition of 5 and 0 is simply 5.

Therefore, the final answer is ""The answer is 5."""

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:

                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    (ii) 5 # 3 + 6
                    = 0 + 6 (since we need to evaluate prime factorization before addition)
                    = 6

                    (iii) 5 - 3 @ 6
                    = 2 @ 6 (since we need to evaluate subtraction before concatenation)
                    = 26

                    (iv) 5 - 3 # 6
                    = 5 - 1 (since we need to evaluate prime factorization before subtraction)
                    = 4

                    (vi) (3 + 10 # 2) * 5 @ 42 
                    = (3 + 1) * 5 @ 42 (we need to evaluate what is in the parenthesis first and prime factor counting is before addition)
                    = 4 * 5 @ 42  (we need to evaluate multiplication before concatenation
                    = 20 @ 42 = 2042. (concatenation is last)

Step 1: Evaluate the prime factor count (F) operation.
   The prime factors of 3 are 3, and the prime factors of 2 are 2.
   There are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, so the result of 3 # 2 is 0.

Step 2: Perform the addition (A) operation.
   Now we can simply perform the addition of 5 and the result from step 1 (which is 0).
   5 + 0 = 5.

Therefore, the value of the expression 5 + 3 # 2 is 5.
