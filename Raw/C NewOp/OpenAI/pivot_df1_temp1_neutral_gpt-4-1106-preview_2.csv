gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem, we must follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC. 

Given the expression: 5 + 2 @ 4

Here's the step-by-step evaluation according to PEFMDASC:

1. (P) Parentheses: There are no parentheses to evaluate.
2. (E) Exponents: There are no exponents in the expression.
3. (F) Prime Factor counting: There is no prime factor counting operation in the expression.
4. (M) Multiplication: There is no multiplication in the expression.
5. (D) Division: There is no division in the expression.
6. (A) Addition: We see an addition operation (5 + 2), but we need to first check if there is a concatenation operation that precedes it.
7. (S) Subtraction: There is no subtraction in the expression.
8. (C) Concatenation: The expression contains concatenation (2 @ 4) which should be performed prior to the addition.

Now evaluate the concatenation:
2 @ 4 = 24 (Since concatenation simply combines the digits of 2 and 4)

Now that we've handled the concatenation, we proceed with addition:
5 + 24 = 29

The final answer to the expression is 29.

The answer is 29."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the given Mathematics problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we will evaluate the expression step by step:

The expression is: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

First, we tackle the prime factor counting (#) operations since they come before addition in the order of operations.

1. Evaluate 8 # 2: 
The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (2^3). 
The prime factors of 2 are just 2. 
They share the prime factor 2.
Since they share only one unique prime factor (which is 2), the result for this portion of the expression is 1.

2. Evaluate 6 # 6:
The prime factors of the first 6 are 2 and 3.
The prime factors of the second 6 are also 2 and 3.
They share the prime factors 2 and 3. However, the operation counts unique shared prime factors, which are 2 and 3, resulting in a count of 2.

Now, with the results of the # operations, the expression becomes:

1 + 2

Next, we evaluate the addition:

1 + 2 = 3

This gives us our final answer:

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem, we follow the new order of operations PEFMDASC.

The problem is: 4 # 3 + 2

According to the order of operations, we first perform the Prime Factor Counting operation (F) before moving to Addition (A).

The operation 4 # 3 stands for the count of unique prime factors shared by 4 and 3.

The prime factors of 4 are 2 (since 4 = 2^2), and the prime factors of 3 are just 3 itself (since 3 is a prime number).

There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so the result of the prime factor counting operation is 0.

The expression now simplifies to:

0 + 2

Now we perform the addition:

0 + 2 = 2

Therefore, the final answer is 2. 

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: First, let's apply the updated order of operations PEFMDASC to the given mathematical expression:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

We should start with parentheses (P):

Since there are parentheses around (14 + 4), we perform that addition first:

(14 + 4) = 18

Now, our expression looks like this:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we proceed with the prime factor counting operation (F) because it comes before addition and subtraction in the order of operations:

We need to find the unique shared prime factors of 2 and 3:

The prime factor of 2 is 2.
The prime factor of 3 is 3.

There are no shared prime factors, so:

2 # 3 = 0.

Our updated expression is:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Now we move to addition and subtraction (A and S):

First, we perform the addition since it comes before the subtraction:

18 + 12 = 30

Now our expression is:

6 @ 30 - 0

We perform the subtraction next:

30 - 0 = 30

The updated expression is:

6 @ 30

The last operation is concatenation (C):

For the concatenation operation, we join the digits of 6 and 30:

6 @ 30 = 630

Now, we have simplified the expression completely, and the final answer is:

The answer is 630."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem, we must follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC. 

Given the expression: 5 + 3 # 2

Here's the step-by-step solution according to PEFMDASC:

1. (P) Parentheses: There are no parentheses in the expression, so we move to the next operation.
2. (E) Exponents: There are no exponents, so we move on.
3. (F) Prime Factor Counting: We need to evaluate 3 # 2. The prime factors of 3 are 3 itself, and the prime factors of 2 are 2 itself. Since they have no shared prime factors, 3 # 2 equals 0.
4. (M) Multiplication: No multiplication in the expression.
5. (D) Division: No division in the expression.
6. (A) Addition: We have to add the result of the prime factor counting to 5.
7. (S) Subtraction: No subtraction in the expression.
8. (C) Concatenation: No concatenation operation in the expression.

So, evaluating 3 # 2, we get:

5 + 3 # 2
= 5 + 0
= 5

The final answer is 5."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To evaluate the expression 5 + 2 @ 4 according to the revised order of operations PEFMDASC, we follow these steps:

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): There are no prime factor counting operations.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There are no multiplication or division operations.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): There is an addition operation, but according to the updated rules, we cannot perform it first because the concatenation operation has precedence over addition/subtraction when they are next to each other.
6. Concatenation (C): Perform the concatenation operation 2 @ 4. Since concatenation means combining the digits of absolute values of 2 and 4, we get 24.

Now, the expression becomes:
5 + 24

7. Addition: Now we perform the addition operation, which is the only operation left.

5 + 24 = 29

The answer is 29."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematical problem following the revised order of operations PEFMDASC, let's break it down step by step:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F) — We need to find the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of each pair of numbers involved in the # operation.

8 # 2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (8 = 2^3). The prime factor of 2 is 2. Since they share the prime factor 2, the count is 1.
6 # 6: The prime factors of the first 6 are 2 and 3. The prime factors of the second 6 are also 2 and 3. Since they share two prime factors, 2 and 3, the count is 2.

2. Addition (A) — With the results from the prime factor counting operation, we proceed to add the values.

(8 # 2) + (6 # 6)
= 1 + 2
= 3

Therefore, after performing the operations step by step according to the new order, the answer to the problem is 3.

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To evaluate the expression 4 # 3 + 2 according to the revised order of operations PEFMDASC, we start with prime factor counting since there are no parentheses or exponents to consider first.

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (since 4 = 2 * 2)
The prime factors of 3 are 3.

There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3. So, the result of 4 # 3 is:

4 # 3 = 0

Now that we have calculated the prime factor counting part, the expression reduces to:

0 + 2

And according to the standard order of operations, we now perform the addition:

0 + 2 = 2

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: Firstly, let's follow the order of operations PEFMDASC to solve the given mathematics problem:

The expression is: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

According to the order of operations, compute the following:

1. Parentheses (P): Resolve operations inside parentheses first.
   In the expression, we have parentheses around (14 + 4), so we evaluate this first:
   14 + 4 = 18

2. Prime Factor Counting (F): Next, we should do the prime factor counting operation.
   In our current expression, the operation 2 # 3 occurs after the prime factor counting in the order of operations needs to be addressed.
   Prime factors of 2 are {2}, and prime factors of 3 are {3}. They share no common prime factors, so:
   2 # 3 = 0

Now the expression has been simplified to:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

3. Multiplication/Division (M/D): There is no multiplication or division to perform next.

4. Addition/Subtraction (A/S): Perform addition and subtraction from left to right.
   We have addition and subtraction in the expression now, but according to the updated order of operations, we have to handle the concatenation before addition and subtraction.

5. Concatenation (C): Perform concatenation next
   The operation 6 @ 18 occurs, which means we must concatenate the digits of 6 and 18:
   6 @ 18 = 618

Now the expression becomes:
618 + 12 - 0

Performing the remaining operations from left to right:
618 + 12 = 630
630 - 0 = 630

So the entire evaluation of the expression is as follows:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12"
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: To evaluate the expression 5 + 3 # 2 according to the revised order of operations PEFMDASC, we first must perform Prime Factor counting before we handle the addition.

Let's apply the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation:

3 # 2 evaluates to the count of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 3 and 2. The number 3 has only one prime factor, which is 3 itself, while the number 2 has only one prime factor, which is 2. Since they do not share any common prime factors, 3 # 2 = 0.

Now that we have the result of the prime factor counting, we perform the addition:

5 + 0 = 5

The answer is 5."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC. We must work through the operations in this specified order: Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting (F), Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), and finally, Concatenation (C) from left to right.

Given the expression:

5 + 2 @ 4

We don't have any Parentheses, Exponents, or Prime Factor Counting to deal with. Multiplication and Division are also not present. Therefore, we move onto Addition and then Concatenation.

Following the rule of performing Addition before Concatenation:

5 + 2 = 7

Now we have:

7 @ 4

According to the definition of Concatenation, we merge the digits of 7 and 4, resulting in:

7 @ 4 = 74

So the final answer is:

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: Let's evaluate the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 following the updated order of operations PEMDAS (where F is for Prime Factor Counting):

1. Calculate prime factor counting (F) before moving on to addition (A).
2. Perform addition (A) as the last step, since there are no parentheses (P), exponents (E), multiplication (M), division (D), subtraction (S), or concatenation (C) to consider in this expression.

The expression is:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6

First, we look at the prime factorization of each number:

- Prime factors of 8 are 2 x 2 x 2.
- Prime factors of 2 are 2.
- Only the number 2 is a shared prime factor between 8 and 2, so 8 # 2 results in 1.

Then we have:

6 # 6

- Prime factors of 6 are 2 x 3.
- Since both numbers are the same, they share the same prime factors, so 6 # 6 results in counting the unique prime factors in the prime factorization of 6 which are 2 and 3, so we have 2 unique prime factors so 6 # 6 results in 2.

Now, we can replace the prime factor counts in the expression:

1 + 2

Now we just need to perform the addition:

1 + 2 = 3.

Therefore, the final answer to the expression is:

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC. We must work out the prime factor counting (F) first, followed by addition (A). 

Given the problem:

4 # 3 + 2

Let's break it down:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): We count the unique prime factors common to 4 and 3.
- The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (or 2^2).
- The prime factor of 3 is 3.

There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so:

4 # 3 = 0

2. Addition (A): We then add the result of step 1 to 2:

0 + 2 = 2

There is no need for concatenation (C) here, as the operation is not present in the problem.

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 2."

5. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)
6. Concatenation (C)

Given Expression:
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:
6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Perform prime factor counting (F), which comes before addition/subtraction and after parentheses:
Note: Only the prime factors common to both numbers are counted. The prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. There are no common prime factors, so 2 # 3 = 0.
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3: Perform addition (since there are no exponents, multiplication, or division to consider before addition):
6 @ 18 + 12
= 6 @ 30

Step 4: Perform concatenation (C) (which is now the last operation to be carried out):
6 @ 30
= 630

The final answer to the given expression is 630. So, the answer is 630."

5 + 3 # 2

First, we find the unique prime factors common to 3 and 2. For 3, that's just 3, and for 2, that's just 2. Since they do not share any prime factors, the result of the prime factor counting (F) is 0:

5 + 3 # 2

This simplifies to:

\(7\)

Now, we perform the concatenation with the result of the addition and the number 4:

\(7 @ 4\)

Following the rules of concatenation, which joins the digits of the numbers:

\(7 @ 4 = 74\)

1. Prime Factor Counting (F)
First, we need to evaluate any prime factor counting operations in the expression.

For 8 # 2:
The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (2^3).
The prime factors of 2 are 2.
The shared prime factors are just 2.
So, 8 # 2 = 1 (since there is only 1 unique shared prime factor, which is 2).

For 6 # 6:
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
The prime factors of the second 6 are also 2 and 3.
The shared prime factors are 2 and 3.
So, 6 # 6 = 2 (since there are 2 unique shared prime factors, which are 2 and 3).

Now our expression looks like this: 1 + 2

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: Let's solve the given problem step by step following the updated order of operations, PEFMDASC.

Given expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
First, we solve the expression within the parentheses.
(14 + 4) = 18

Now the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents in the given expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
We prioritize the prime factor counting operation.
2 # 3, since the prime factors of 2 are {2} and the prime factors of 3 are {3}, there are no shared prime factors.
2 # 3 = 0

Now the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication (M) and Division (D)
There are no multiplication or division operations to perform.

Step 5: Addition (A) and Subtraction (S)
Before we can perform addition and subtraction, we need to address any concatenation operations that come after them in the order of operations.

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
We have a concatenation operation to perform: 6 @ 18
Concatenation joins the digits of 6 and 18 together.
6 @ 18 = 618
