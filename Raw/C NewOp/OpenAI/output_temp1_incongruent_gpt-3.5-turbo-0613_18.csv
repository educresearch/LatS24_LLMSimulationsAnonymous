First, we evaluate what is inside the parentheses:

Next, we perform the concatenation operation:
6 @ 18 = 618

Then, we move on to the subtraction operation:
618 - 12 = 606

After that, we perform the prime factor counting operation:
2 # 3 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor between 2 and 3 is 2)

Finally, we subtract the result of the prime factor counting from the previous result:
606 - 1 = 605

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

Step 1: Evaluate Parentheses
There are no parentheses in the expression, so we can move on to the next step.

Step 2: Evaluate Exponents
There are no exponents in the expression, so we move on to the next step.

Step 3: Evaluate Prime Factor Counting
We have the expression 2#3, which means we need to count the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 2 and 3. Both 2 and 3 are prime numbers and they have no shared prime factors. So 2#3 = 0.

Step 4: Evaluate Multiplication and Division (left to right)
There are no multiplication or division operations in the expression, so we move on to the next step.

Step 5: Evaluate Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
We have the expression 14+4. Evaluating from left to right, we get 14+4 = 18.

Step 6: Evaluate Concatenation (left to right)
Now we have 6 @ (18) + 12 - 0. Since concatenation is the last operation to be performed, we can evaluate it.

6 @ 18 = 618 (concatenating the digits of 6 and 18)

So, the expression becomes 618 + 12 - 0.

Finally, we evaluate the addition and subtraction operations from left to right.

618 + 12 = 630
630 - 0 = 630

The answer is 630."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:

                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To evaluate the expression 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2 # 3 using the PEFMDASC order, let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses.
14 + 4 = 18

The expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Evaluate the concatenation operation.
Since the concatenation operation (C) comes after addition and subtraction but before multiplication and division, we need to evaluate it next.

6 @ 18 = 618 (concatenating the digits 6 and 18 together)

The expression becomes: 618 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 3: Evaluate the subtraction operation.
618 + 12 = 630
630 - 2 = 628

The expression becomes: 628 - 2 # 3

Step 4: Evaluate the prime factor counting operation.
Since the prime factor counting operation (F) comes after subtraction but before multiplication and division, we need to evaluate it next.

2 # 3 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor between 2 and 3 is 1)

The expression becomes: 628 - 1

Step 5: Evaluate the final subtraction operation.
628 - 1 = 627

Therefore, the answer is 627."

There are no parentheses in the expression, so we can move on to the next step.

Step 2: Exponents
There are no exponents in the expression, so we move on to the next step.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
We need to calculate the prime factor count of 3 and 2 and find the number of shared prime factors between them.

The prime factors of 3 are {3}.
The prime factors of 2 are {2}.
The shared prime factors between 3 and 2 are { } (empty set).

Therefore, 3 # 2 = 0.
