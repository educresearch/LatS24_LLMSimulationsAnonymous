                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

First, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation. The prime factors of 3 are 3, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. There are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, so 3 # 2 = 0.

Now, we perform addition (A) on 5 and the result of the prime factor counting operation which is 0. Therefore, 5 + 0 = 5.

                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-1106_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), let's proceed step by step:

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
Inside the parentheses, we have 14 + 4.
14 + 4 = 18

So, the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: Concatenation (C)
Now, we apply the concatenation operation (C) to 6 and 18.
6 @ 18 = 618

The expression becomes: 618 + 12 - 2#3

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we calculate the prime factor count between 2 and 3.
2 and 3 have no shared prime factors, so 2#3 = 0.

The expression becomes: 618 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Addition (A)
Now, we perform the addition operation (A) between 618 and 12.
618 + 12 = 630

The expression becomes: 630 - 0

Step 5: Subtraction (S)
Finally, we perform the subtraction operation (S) between 630 and 0.
630 - 0 = 630

Therefore, the answer is 630."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together.

                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

First, we find the prime factors of the absolute values of 3 and 2:

The prime factors of |2| are 2 (since 2 is a prime number).

Now, we determine the count of shared prime factors between |3| and |2|:
There are no shared prime factors, so the prime factor count (#) is 0.
