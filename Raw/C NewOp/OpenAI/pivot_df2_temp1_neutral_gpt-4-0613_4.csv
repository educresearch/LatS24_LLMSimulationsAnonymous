gpt-4-0613,1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: Given the problem, 4 # 3 + 2, we will use the new order of operations, which is PEFMDASC. 

First, apply the Prime Factor counting operation (F): The number 4 has prime factors {2}, and the number 3 is prime only with itself, i.e. there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3. Therefore, 4 # 3 equals 0.

So, our expression now becomes 0 + 2. 

Next, apply the Addition operation (A): 0 + 2 equals 2. 

Therefore, the answer to the problem 4 # 3 + 2 is 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: The problem is solved using the order of operations PEFMDASC. 

First, Prime factor counting (F) is executed. 
The prime factor of 4 is 2, and the prime factor of 3 is 3. 
Therefore, there is no shared prime factor between them, and the Prime Factor Counting operation returns 0.

The operation becomes:
0 + 2

After that, the remaining operation is addition. Because we've solved all the rest operations in the order of PEFMDASC, now we simply add 0 + 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: The given mathematical operation is 4 # 3 + 2.

The first step would be to count the unique prime factors common to |4| and |3|, denoted as 4 # 3 using Prime Factor Counting. The prime factor of 4 is 2, and the prime factor of 3 is 3. Thus, there are no shared factors.

So, 4 # 3 becomes 0.

Now, we have 0 + 2. Finally, performing addition gives 2.

So, the solution to the given problem is 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Let's solve this expression using the PEFMDASC order of operations:
The expression we have is 4 # 3 + 2.

Step 1: F (Prime Factor Counting)
Prime factors of 4 are 2, and of 3 are 3. Since there are no shared prime factors, 4 # 3 will be 0.
So, the expression becomes 0 + 2.

Step 2: A (Addition)
The updated expression becomes: 0 + 2 = 2.

Therefore, the answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: In this given problem, according to the mathematics convention, we need to conduct addition operation before we move on to the concatenation operation.

So, we first add 5 and 2 which equals 7

Then, we proceed to perform concatenation operation between 7 and 4, denoted as ""7 @ 4"". The resulting number will be 74.

Therefore, the final answer for this problem is 74.

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: Use the new order of operations PEFMDASC to solve this expression.

PEFMDASC stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right, and Concatenation from left to right.

However, in this expression (5 + 2 @ 4), only two operations are present: Addition and Concatenation. So, we have to follow the order, which is first Addition and then Concatenation.

Start with the Addition:
5 + 2 = 7 

Then Concatenation:
7 @ 4 = 74 

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: Given the problem 5 + 2 @ 4, we follow the rules of the new order of operations, PEFMDASC.

According to this new order of operations, Addition (A) should be done before Concatenation (C). 

5 + 2 = 7

Then, we proceed to the Concatenation of the result and 4:

7 @ 4 = 74

Hence, the solution to the problem 5 + 2 @ 4, according to these new rules, is 74.

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: Let's solve this expression using the PEFMDASC order of operations:
1. The given expression is 5 + 2 @ 4 
2. According to the PEFMDASC order, we need to perform addition (A) before concatenation (C). 
3. So first, we add 5 + 2 = 7.
4. Now, we are left with 7 @ 4.
5. The @ operation concatenates two numbers together. The digits of the absolute values of the two numbers are joined together.
6. So, 7 @ 4 = 74.

gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: Given the problem, 5 + 3 # 2, based on the new convention we need to carry out the operations in the order specified by PEFMDASC.

First, determine the prime factors of 3 and 2. The prime factor of 3 is 3 and of 2 is 2. There are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2. Therefore, 3 # 2 equals 0.

So, our problem now becomes 5 + 0. 

The last operation to perform is the addition, 5 + 0 equals 5. 

Therefore, the answer to the problem is 5.

""The answer is 5.""","GPT Response: The problem is solved following the order of operations PEFMDASC. 

First, Prime factor counting (#) comes before addition (+). 

Prime factor counting (F): 3 # 2 = 1
(since prime factors of 3 are 3 and prime factors of 2 are 2; as there is no shared factor, the prime factor counting is 0)

Substitute this back into the original problem, yielding 5 + 1 = 6.

The answer is 6.","GPT Response: Given the problem, 5 + 3 # 2:

First, we need to evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation since it comes before addition in the PEFMDASC order. 

The prime factor of 2 is itself, i.e. 2.
However, there are no common prime factors between 3 and 2. 

Therefore, 3 # 2 will equals to 0.

The problem thus simplifies to 5 + 0 which equals to 5.

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: Step-by-step explanation:

We start by respecting the PEFMDASC order of operations.

1. First, there are no parentheses or exponents to deal with.

2. Then, we deal with prime factor counting (F). So, we evaluate 3 # 2. The prime factor of 3 is 3, and of 2 is 2. As there are no shared prime factors, 3 # 2 is 0.

3. Now, we deal with addition, so 5 + 0 equates to 5.

gpt-4-0613,1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: Following the Order of Operation (PEFMDASC), the given problem should be solved in the following manner:

Start with the Parenthesis:
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, Prime Factor Counting:
6 # 18 = 1 (since both 6 and 18 have the prime factor 2)
So, 
6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

Now, Addition and Subtraction: 
6 @ 18 + 11 (from 12 - 1)
6 @ 18 + 29

Lastly, Concatenation:
618 @ 29 = 61829

So, ""The answer is 61829.""","GPT Response: Using the revised order of operations, the given expression is simplified as follows:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 (since parentheses come first in the order)
= 618 + 12 - 2 # 3 (since we need to evaluate concatenation next)
= 618 + 12 - 1 (since prime factor counting comes before addition and subtraction; here, 2 and 3 share only prime factor 2, so their prime factor count is 1)
= 630 - 1 (next, we carry out addition)
= 629 (finally, we do the subtraction)

Therefore, 
The answer is 629.","GPT Response: To solve the mathematical expression given, we'll employ the updated order of operations PEFMDASC: Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction, Concatenation.

Firstly, we will deal with what's within the parentheses (P).
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 

Next, we'll evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F).
6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (since prime factors of 2 are [2] and prime factors of 3 are [3], no shared prime factor exists)
= 6 @ 18 + 11 

Then, we perform Addition and Subtraction (A/S).
6 @ 29 
Finally, we perform the Concatenation (C).
629
Therefore, The answer is 629.","GPT Response: Let's solve this using the PEFMDASC order of operations.

Step 1: Parentheses
We start by resolving the parenthesis: 

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting
Next, we calculate the prime factor counting operation (F). Prime factors of 2 are 2, and prime factors of 3 are 3. So, there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3, so result of 2 # 3 is 0.

So, our equation will become:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction
Since we don't have any Exponents, Multiplication, and Division operations, we go further to Addition and Subtraction. We have one addition operation and one subtraction operation. But in PEFMDASC, addition comes before subtraction. So, we perform the addition operation (6 @ 18) + 12 first:

= 6 @ 18 + 12
= 6 @ 30

Now we subtract the result of our addition from previous step:

= 6 @ 30 - 0
= 6 @ 30

Step 4: Concatenation
Now all that's left is the Concatenation:

= 6 @ 30
= 630

So the final answer to this problem is:

The answer is 630."
gpt-4-0613,1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: First, evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operations (F), as it comes before addition according to the PEFMDASC order of operations.

In the first Prime Factor Counting operation (F): 8 # 2
The prime factors of 8 are {2}, and the prime factors of 2 are {2}. So there is 1 shared prime factor.
Therefore, 8 # 2 equals 1.

In the second Prime Factor Counting operation: 6 # 6
The prime factors of 6 are {2, 3}, and of course they are identically same for 6 itself.
So there are 2 shared prime factors, and 6 # 6 equals 2.

Therefore, now we have 1 + 2.

Finally, perform the addition and calculate 1 + 2, which equals 3.

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Following the PEFMDASC order of operations with focus on Prime Factor Counting (F) and Addition (A):

8 # 2 + 6 # 6
= 1 + 1 (Remember, 8 shares the prime factor 2 with 2 while 6 shares the prime factor 2 with 6 and prime factor counting is before addition)
= 2

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: First, it's important to remember the order of operations or PEMDAS, which has now been updated to PEFMDASC following the introduction of Concatenation and Prime Factor Counting. Using this updated order of operations, we find the Prime Factor Counting values first:

8 # 2 = |-8| # |2| = 8 # 2 = 1 (since the only prime factor they share is 2) 

6 # 6 = |6| # |6| = 6 # 6 = 1 (since they are the same number, they have the same prime factors)

Next, according to PEFMDASC, we perform addition:

1 + 1 = 2

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Let's solve this problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations.

First, we have to perform the prime factor counting operations as F comes before A in PEFMDASC:

       8 # 2 + 6 # 6

The prime factor counting operation, denoted by #, calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the numbers.

For 8 and 2, the prime factors of 8 are 2, and the prime factors of 2 are also 2. There is only one shared prime factor, which is 2. So, 8 # 2 = 1.

Similarly, for 6 and 6, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 6 are also 2 and 3. There are two shared prime factors, which are 2 and 3. So, 6 # 6 = 2.

Substituting these back into the equation:

       = 1 + 2

Next is addition, denoted by +:

       = 3

The answer is 3."
