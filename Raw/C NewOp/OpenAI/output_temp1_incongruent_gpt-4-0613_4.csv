systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

Next, according to the updated order of operations, we do Prime Factor Counting operation:

The prime factors of 2 are just 2, and the prime factors of 3 are also just 3. So, they share no common prime factors. Thus, F value of 2#3=0

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

6 @ 30

Step 1:
Evaluate 8 # 2, which calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 8 and 2.
The prime factor of 8 is 2 (since 8 = 2*2*2), and the prime factor of 2 is also 2.
Therefore, they share one prime factor (2), so 8 # 2 = 1.

Step 2:

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 6 are also 2 and 3.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Let's solve this expression step by step using the PEFMDASC order.

Given expression: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
First we solve the operation within parentheses, which is addition in this case because according to PEFMDASC, addition comes before concatenation.

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3 

Step 2: Prime factor counting (F)
We solve prime factor counting operation next because according to PEFMDASC, prime factor counting comes before addition and subtraction.
Prime factors of 2 are 2 and that of 3 is 3, so they share no prime factors.

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 

Step 3: Addition/Subtraction (A/S)
Now, there are only concatenation, addition and subtraction left. We do addition and subtraction first, going from left to right.

= 6 @ 18 + 12 
= 6 @ 30
= 630 

So, there is only concatenation operation left. 

The answer is 630."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Let's solve this equation step by step:

We'll denote the Prime Factor counting operation with F for simplicity.

1) First, we need to deal with the operations within parentheses. Here, there are no parentheses, so we move to the next step.

2) There are no exponent operations in the equation, so we go to the next step.

3) Now, we have to evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operation (F). In the equation, we have 3 # 2. Here, the unique prime factors for 3 are {3} and for 2 are {2}. There are no shared prime factors, so 3 # 2 = 0.

So, the equation becomes: 5 + 0.

4) Next, there are no multiplication or division operations in the equation, so we move on to step 5.

5) Now we see addition operation. So, the equation 5 + 0 = 5.

6) Lastly, we check for any concatenation operations, but there are none, so we are done.

The answer is 5."
