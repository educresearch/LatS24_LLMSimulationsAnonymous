So,
5 + 2 @ 4
= 7 @ 4 (since we need to evaluate addition before concatenation)
= 74 (since the @ operation simply concatenates the numbers)

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: Given the expression is 8 # 2 + 6 # 6.

Following the PEFMDASC order of operations:

Firstly, perform the prime factor counting:

We know that 

- prime factors of 8 are 2,
- prime factors of 2 are 2, 
- prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.

Hence 

- 8 # 2 = 1 (Since there is 1 common prime factor i.e., 2)
- 6 # 6 = 2 (Since there are 2 common prime factors i.e., 2 and 3).

The expression becomes 1 + 2.

Finally, we perform the addition which gives us 1 + 2 = 3.

So, the answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: Based on the new order of operations:
First, the Prime Factor Counting operation (F) is performed:
The number 4 has two as its prime factor, and the number 3 has three as its prime factor. Hence, they have no common prime factors. Therefore, 4 # 3 equals 0.

Next, the Addition operation (A) is performed on the remaining numbers:
0 + 2 equals 2.

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Following the order of operation PEFMDASC:

Original expression: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

First solve the parentheses expression:

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Now solve for the prime factor counting expression:

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (since prime factors of 2 is '2' and for 3 also '2' is a prime factor so, there is only one shared factor)

Now solve for addition operation:

= 6 @ 18 + 11

Then solve for the concatenation operation which is after all operation:

= 618 + 11

Finally, solve for the addition:

= 629

So, the answer is 629."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: Based on the new order of operations PEFMDASC (Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction, Concatenation), we should first evaluate the prime factor counting operation before addition.

So we first find the count of unique prime factors shared by 3 and 2. 

The prime factor of 3 is 3 and the prime factor of 2 is 2. Therefore, there is no shared prime factor, i.e., 3 # 2 = 0.

Substituting this result into the original operation, we get 5 + 0.

Solving this operation, we finally find that 5 + 0 = 5.

So the answer to this Mathematics problem is 5. The answer is 5."

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: Based on the problem given, we need to follow the PEFMDASC order to solve it.

We start with the prime factor counting operation:

For 8 # 2, both 8 and 2 only have a single prime factor, 2. Hence the number of shared prime factors is 1.
So, we get 1 + 6 # 6.

For 6 # 6, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. As we are comparing the same number, the number of shared prime factors is the number of its unique prime factors, i.e. 2.
So, we get 1 + 2.

Finally, we perform the addition operation to get 1 + 2 = 3.

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: In the expression 4#3 + 2, we first find the number of shared unique prime factors of 4 and 3. The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factor of 3 is 3. Since 4 and 3 have no shared unique prime factors, 4#3 is 0.

So, we then have:

4#3 + 2 = 0 + 2

0 + 2 = 2

Therefore, the solution of the operation is:

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: First, we must find the result of the operation inside the parentheses, which is addition:

6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Then, according to the order of operations, we must proceed with the operation of Prime Factor counting (F): 

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

Note that it is one because the prime factors of 2 are {2} and the prime factors of 3 are {3} so we have only one common prime factor which is 2.

Next, we still follow the rule of order of operations. We need to do the operation of Concatenation (C) next:

= 618 + 12 - 1

Then we do addition and subtraction operations from left to right:

= 630 - 1 

Finally,

= 629

So, the answer is 629."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, Prime Factor counting (F) is evaluated before addition.

For 5 + 3 # 2, we need to calculate the prime factor counting between 3 and 2 first.
