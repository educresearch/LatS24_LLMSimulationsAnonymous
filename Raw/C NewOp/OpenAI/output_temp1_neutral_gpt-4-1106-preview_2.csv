Given the expression: 5 + 2 @ 4

Here's the step-by-step evaluation according to PEFMDASC:

1. (P) Parentheses: There are no parentheses to evaluate.
2. (E) Exponents: There are no exponents in the expression.
3. (F) Prime Factor counting: There is no prime factor counting operation in the expression.
4. (M) Multiplication: There is no multiplication in the expression.
5. (D) Division: There is no division in the expression.
6. (A) Addition: We see an addition operation (5 + 2), but we need to first check if there is a concatenation operation that precedes it.
7. (S) Subtraction: There is no subtraction in the expression.
8. (C) Concatenation: The expression contains concatenation (2 @ 4) which should be performed prior to the addition.

Now evaluate the concatenation:
2 @ 4 = 24 (Since concatenation simply combines the digits of 2 and 4)

Now that we've handled the concatenation, we proceed with addition:
5 + 24 = 29

The final answer to the expression is 29.

The answer is 29."

The expression is: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

First, we tackle the prime factor counting (#) operations since they come before addition in the order of operations.

1. Evaluate 8 # 2: 
The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (2^3). 
The prime factors of 2 are just 2. 
They share the prime factor 2.
Since they share only one unique prime factor (which is 2), the result for this portion of the expression is 1.

2. Evaluate 6 # 6:
The prime factors of the first 6 are 2 and 3.
The prime factors of the second 6 are also 2 and 3.
They share the prime factors 2 and 3. However, the operation counts unique shared prime factors, which are 2 and 3, resulting in a count of 2.

The prime factors of 4 are 2 (since 4 = 2^2), and the prime factors of 3 are just 3 itself (since 3 is a prime number).

systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: First, let's apply the updated order of operations PEFMDASC to the given mathematical expression:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

We should start with parentheses (P):

Since there are parentheses around (14 + 4), we perform that addition first:

(14 + 4) = 18

Now, our expression looks like this:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we proceed with the prime factor counting operation (F) because it comes before addition and subtraction in the order of operations:

We need to find the unique shared prime factors of 2 and 3:

The prime factor of 2 is 2.
The prime factor of 3 is 3.

There are no shared prime factors, so:

2 # 3 = 0.

Our updated expression is:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Now we move to addition and subtraction (A and S):

First, we perform the addition since it comes before the subtraction:

18 + 12 = 30

Now our expression is:

6 @ 30 - 0

We perform the subtraction next:

30 - 0 = 30

The updated expression is:

6 @ 30

The last operation is concatenation (C):

For the concatenation operation, we join the digits of 6 and 30:

6 @ 30 = 630

Now, we have simplified the expression completely, and the final answer is:

The answer is 630."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (since 4 = 2 * 2)
The prime factors of 3 are 3.

There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3. So, the result of 4 # 3 is:

4 # 3 = 0

Now that we have calculated the prime factor counting part, the expression reduces to:

systemPrompt2_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Firstly, let's follow the order of operations PEFMDASC to solve the given mathematics problem:

The expression is: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

According to the order of operations, compute the following:

1. Parentheses (P): Resolve operations inside parentheses first.
   In the expression, we have parentheses around (14 + 4), so we evaluate this first:
   14 + 4 = 18

2. Prime Factor Counting (F): Next, we should do the prime factor counting operation.
   In our current expression, the operation 2 # 3 occurs after the prime factor counting in the order of operations needs to be addressed.
   Prime factors of 2 are {2}, and prime factors of 3 are {3}. They share no common prime factors, so:
   2 # 3 = 0

Now the expression has been simplified to:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

3. Multiplication/Division (M/D): There is no multiplication or division to perform next.

4. Addition/Subtraction (A/S): Perform addition and subtraction from left to right.
   We have addition and subtraction in the expression now, but according to the updated order of operations, we have to handle the concatenation before addition and subtraction.

5. Concatenation (C): Perform concatenation next
   The operation 6 @ 18 occurs, which means we must concatenate the digits of 6 and 18:
   6 @ 18 = 618

Now the expression becomes:
618 + 12 - 0

Performing the remaining operations from left to right:
618 + 12 = 630
630 - 0 = 630

So the entire evaluation of the expression is as follows:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12"

We must work through the operations in this specified order: Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting (F), Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), and finally, Concatenation (C) from left to right.

Given the expression:

5 + 2 @ 4

We don't have any Parentheses, Exponents, or Prime Factor Counting to deal with. Multiplication and Division are also not present. Therefore, we move onto Addition and then Concatenation.

Following the rule of performing Addition before Concatenation:

5 + 2 = 7

Now we have:

7 @ 4

According to the definition of Concatenation, we merge the digits of 7 and 4, resulting in:

7 @ 4 = 74

So the final answer is:

The answer is 74."

1. Calculate prime factor counting (F) before moving on to addition (A).
2. Perform addition (A) as the last step, since there are no parentheses (P), exponents (E), multiplication (M), division (D), subtraction (S), or concatenation (C) to consider in this expression.

The expression is:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6

First, we look at the prime factorization of each number:

- Prime factors of 8 are 2 x 2 x 2.
- Prime factors of 2 are 2.
- Only the number 2 is a shared prime factor between 8 and 2, so 8 # 2 results in 1.

Then we have:

6 # 6

- Prime factors of 6 are 2 x 3.
- Since both numbers are the same, they share the same prime factors, so 6 # 6 results in counting the unique prime factors in the prime factorization of 6 which are 2 and 3, so we have 2 unique prime factors so 6 # 6 results in 2.

Now, we can replace the prime factor counts in the expression:

1 + 2

Now we just need to perform the addition:

1 + 2 = 3.

Therefore, the final answer to the expression is:

The answer is 3."

                    Attention! This is a crucial update in mathematics, and I need your full understanding and accurate explanations. 
                    It's essential that you grasp these new concepts quickly and efficiently to provide clear and helpful responses.

                    New Operations Introduced:

                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a@b, this operation merges the digits of |a| and |b|. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a@b = |a|@|b| = |12|@|-56| = 12@56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a@b = 0@24 = 024 = 24.
                    Please make sure you understand this properly; it's simple yet fundamental.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted as a#b, it counts the unique prime factors common to |a| and |b|. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.
                    It's crucial to get this right for accurate calculations.
                    
                    Updated Order of Operations: PEFMDASC:

                    A/S: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
                    C: Concatenation (left to right)
                    Your ability to adapt to these changes is vital. 
                    These aren't just theoretical concepts; they're practical tools that require your immediate attention and understanding.

                    = 20 @ 42 = 2042. (concatenation is last)

1. Prime Factor Counting (F)
First, we need to evaluate any prime factor counting operations in the expression.

For 8 # 2:
The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (2^3).
The prime factors of 2 are 2.
The shared prime factors are just 2.
So, 8 # 2 = 1 (since there is only 1 unique shared prime factor, which is 2).

For 6 # 6:

The prime factors of the second 6 are also 2 and 3.
The shared prime factors are 2 and 3.

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): We will first evaluate the “Prime Factor Counting” operation in \(4 \# 3\). 
   - The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
   - The prime factors of 3 are just 3.
   There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so \(4 \# 3 = 0\).

2. Addition (A): Now we are left with the simple addition \(0 + 2\), which is straightforward.

Given expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
First, we solve the expression within the parentheses.
(14 + 4) = 18

Now the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents in the given expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
We prioritize the prime factor counting operation.
2 # 3, since the prime factors of 2 are {2} and the prime factors of 3 are {3}, there are no shared prime factors.
2 # 3 = 0

Now the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication (M) and Division (D)
There are no multiplication or division operations to perform.

Step 5: Addition (A) and Subtraction (S)
Before we can perform addition and subtraction, we need to address any concatenation operations that come after them in the order of operations.

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
We have a concatenation operation to perform: 6 @ 18
Concatenation joins the digits of 6 and 18 together.
6 @ 18 = 618

Now the expression becomes: 618 + 12 - 0

Step 7: Addition and Subtraction
Since we're now only left with addition and subtraction, we can perform them from left to right.
618 + 12 = 630
630 - 0 = 630

The final answer is 630."
