The prime factor of 4 is 2 and prime factor of 3 is 3. They don't have any common prime factor. So, 4 # 3 equals 0.<br><br>So, the problem becomes 0 + 2.<br><br>The addition operation gives the result 2.<br><br>Therefore, The answer is 2.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, let's apply the new order of operations, PEFMDASC, to solve this problem.<br><br>The operation in this case is Prime Factor Counting (denoted as #), followed by addition (+). According to the updated order of operations, Prime Factor Counting (F) is performed before Addition (A). <br><br>4#3 means we're looking for the count of unique prime factors common to 4 and 3. The prime factors of 4 are 2 (2*2), and the prime factor of 3 is 3, so there are no prime factors shared between 4 and 3.
