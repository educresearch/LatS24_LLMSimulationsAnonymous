   2 # 3 = 0

3. Now, we perform the concatenation operation from left to right:

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

The prime factor counting of 3 # 2 is 1, since the only shared prime factor between 3 and 2 is 2 itself. 

Therefore, the expression simplifies to 5 + 1.

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 using the PEFMDASC order, let's break it down step by step:

Step 1: Parentheses
Inside the parentheses, we have the expression (14 + 4). We'll start by solving this part first.
(14 + 4) = 18

The expression now becomes 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3.

Step 2: Concatenation (C)
Next, we need to evaluate the concatenation operation 6 @ 18.
6 @ 18 = 618

The expression now becomes 618 + 12 - 2 # 3.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Now, we need to calculate the prime factor count for 2 and 3.
2 # 3 = 1
Since 2 and 3 have no shared prime factors, the count is 0.

The expression now becomes 618 + 12 - 0.

Step 4: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Now, let's perform addition and subtraction from left to right.
618 + 12 = 630
630 - 0 = 630

The expression simplifies to 630.

Therefore, the answer is 630."
