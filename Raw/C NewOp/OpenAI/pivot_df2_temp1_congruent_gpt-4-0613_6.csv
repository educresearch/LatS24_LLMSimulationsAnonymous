Step 1: Evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F)

Perform 4 # 3. 
Number 4 and 3 have no common prime factors, 4 has 2 as its prime factor and 3 is itself a prime number. 

So, 4 # 3 = 0 

Step 2: Perform Addition (A)

Now we have to add the result from step 1 to 2:
0 + 2 = 2

So, the final answer to this problem, according to the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), is 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: The prime factors of 4 are 2 and the prime factor of 3 is 3. They do not share any prime factor. Thus, 4 # 3 = 0. Hence, our problem changes to:

0 + 2

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: The given math problem is 4 # 3 + 2.

Step 1: Following the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), you have to evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) first. The prime factor of 4 is 2 and the prime factor of 3 is 3. There are no shared prime factors, so the result of 4 # 3 is 0.

So, the equation becomes: 0 + 2.

Step 2: Then, perform the Addition operation (A). So, 0 + 2 equals 2.

Thus, the final answer is 2. 

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Let's breakdown the expression step-by-step according to the order of operations PEFMDASC.

Expression: 4 # 3 + 2

Step 1 (Prime Factor Counting - 'F'): Evaluate 4 # 3. 

* Prime factors of |4|: 2.
* Prime factors of |3|: 3.
They do not have a common prime factor.

So, 4 # 3 = 0.

The updated expression will be: 0 + 2.

Step 2 (Addition - 'A'): Now, we perform the addition operation which gives: 

0 + 2 = 2. 

Therefore, the final answer to the problem 4 # 3+2 is 2 according to the new order of operations PEFMDASC."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: To solve this based on the new order of operations, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation first, before addition.

Step 1: Find the count of unique prime factors shared by 3 and 2.
The prime factors of 3 are 3 and of 2 is 2. There are no shared prime factors between them. So, 3#2 = 0.

Step 2: 5 + (3#2) =>
        5 + 0 

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: The prime factors of 3 are {3}, and the prime factors of 2 are {2}. Therefore, there are no shared prime factors, thus 3#2=0.

Following the order of operations, the Prime Factor counting is done first:

5 + 3#2 = 5 + 0

Finally, we perform the addition:

5 + 0 = 5

Therefore, the answer to the problem 5 + 3#2 is 5.

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: The given math problem is 5 + 3#2.

We firstly consider the operation of Prime Factor Counting (#) in our expression following the Order of Operations (PEFMDASC), before we can do addition.

Prime factors of 3 are 3 and prime factors of 2 are 2. They have no common unique prime factor, so 3#2 = 0.

So the updated expression is 5 + 0.

Finally, we perform the addition (5 + 0), yielding 5.

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: Let's breakdown the expression step-by-step according to the order of operations PEFMDASC.

Expression: 5 + 3 # 2

Step 1 (Prime Factor Counting, F): 3 # 2 
The prime factors of 3 are {3} and the prime factors of 2 are {2}. There are no shared prime factors, thus 3 # 2 = 0.

So, the expression at this point is: 5 + 0

Step 2 (Addition, A): 5 + 0 = 5

So, the answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Following the newly defined order of operations (PEFMDASC), the problem 5 + 2 @ 4 is understood and processed as follows:

Firstly, following the order in PEFMDASC, there are no Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting and Multiplication or Division to be performed. We have an Addition operation and a Concatenation operation.

Addition comes before Concatenation in the order of operations.

Thereby, performing the Addition operation 5 + 2 first gives us 7.

Then, we proceed to the Concatenation operation with the result from the Addition, and perform 7 @ 4.

This Concatenation operation, 7 @ 4, joins the numbers together at a digit level, giving us 74.

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations, we proceed with addition before concatenation. 

So, 5 + 2 = 7. Then, we concatenate the resulting 7 @ 4. 

Therefore,

7 @ 4 = 74. 

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations, you should perform addition before concatenation. 

So, firstly you perform 5 + 2 which equals to 7.

Then you proceed to the concatenation operation 7 @ 4, so the result would be 74.

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: Let's breakdown this example step-by-step according to the order of operations PEFMDASC.

Operation: 5 + 2 @ 4

1. Parentheses (P): There are no parentheses, so we move to the next operation.
2. Exponents (E): There are no exponents, so we move to the next operation.
3. Prime Factor counting (F): There are no prime factor counting operation (#), so we move to the next.
4. Multiplication/Division (M/D): There are no multiplication or division operations, so we move to the next.
5. Addition/Subtraction (A/S): Here, we have addition operation. So we perform the addition before moving to the next operation. 
   So, 5 + 2 = 7

Now, our operation looks like: 7 @ 4

6. Concatenation (C): Now we perform the concatenation, which is the last operation in our order. We concatenate 7 (|7|) and 4 (|4|) to get 74.

Therefore, 5 + 2 @ 4 = 74 according to the new order of operations.

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: Firstly, follow the Parentheses first, to find the number in the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18.
So, the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3.

Because Prime Factor Counting (F) comes before Addition (A) and Subtraction (S), next you would find that 2 # 3 = 0
(since prime factor of 2 is 2 and prime factor of 3 is 3, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

So, the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 = 6 @ 18 + 12.

Then, because Addition (A) comes before Concatenation (C), you calculate: 18 + 12 = 30.
So, the expression becomes: 6 @ 30.

Finally, according to the rule of concatenation, the expression is simplified to 630.

The answer is 630.","GPT Response: Based on the given order of operations PEFMDASC, we should follow these steps:

1. Process Parentheses first:
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 

2. Now, calculate Prime Factor Counting operation(F) next, where there are no prime factors of 2 to count, so it is 0:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 

3. Now, calculate Addition/Subtraction (A/S) operations from left to right:
(6 @ 18) + 12 = 618 + 12 = 630

4. Lastly, perform the Concatenation (C) operation:
The final result is 630.

So, the answer is 630.","GPT Response: Let's take the problem: 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3

According to PEFMDASC:

Step 1 - Parentheses:

Because they are the highest priority, we need to evaluate the part within parentheses first. This gives us:

6@(18) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2 - Prime Factor counting:

Counts the unique prime factors common to |a| and |b|. The hash operation (14#4) comes next according to the order of operations after the parentheses. However, there is no F operation in this step. So, we move on to the next operation.

Step 3 - Multiplication and Division:

There's no multiplication or division operation in the equation. So, we move on to the next operation.

Step 4 - Addition and Subtraction:

Let's perform the addition first. Which gives:

6@18 + 10 # 3 (since we subtract 2 from 12)

There's no more subtraction operation left in the equation. 

Step 5 - Concatenation:

Let's now perform the concatenation operation:

618 + 10 # 3

Step 6 - Again, ADDITION and Prime factor counting:

Adding 618 to the result of 10#3:

618 + 0 = 618 (since there are no common prime factors between 10 and 3)

Finally,

The answer is 618.","GPT Response: Let's solve this step-by-step using the updated PEFMDASC order:

Step 1 (Parentheses): Solve the equation within the parentheses:

6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3 

= 6@18 + 12-2 # 3 

Step 2 (Prime Factor Counting, F): Evaluate the operation denoted by '#': 

6@18 + 12-2 # 3

= 6@18 + 12-1

= 6@18 + 11

Step 3 (Concatenation, Division, Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction C/D/M/A/S): First, carry out concatenation operation, then perform subtraction operation since there is no multiplication or division operation in the equation. 

= 618 + 11

= 629

So, the answer is 629."
gpt-4-0613,1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: In the given operation, the problem is 8#2 + 6#6 to be solved.

Following the order of operations (PEFMDASC), we start with the prime factor counting operation symbolized by # 

1. The prime factor of |8| are 2 and the prime factors of |2| is 2, so 8#2 = 1 because there is 1 shared prime factor.

2. The prime factor of |6| are 2 and 3 and the prime factor of |6| is 2 and 3 (which are exactly the same). So, 6#6 = 2 because there are 2 shared prime factors.

So, the problem becomes 1 + 2. Adding them together, we obtain: 

1 + 2 = 3.

Hence, the answer is 3.","GPT Response: Given the new operations and order of operations, we start off with the Prime Factor Counting:
The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2 and the prime factors of 2 are 2, so shared prime factors = 1 (which is 2). Therefore, 8#2 equals 1.

For 6#6, the prime factors of 6 are 2, 3 and the prime factors of 6 (which is the same number) are also 2, 3, so all prime factors are shared. Therefore, 6#6 equals 2 (which are 2 and 3).

Then we move on to Addition:

So, the equation now becomes 1+2 which equals 3.

Hence, the answer is 3.","GPT Response: Given the mathematical expression 8#2 + 6#6, we can solve it using the following steps:

First, applying the Prime Factor Counting operation on the expression:
8#2 = The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and the only prime factor of 2 is 2. Therefore, there is 1 common prime factor.

6#6 = The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Here, both 'a' and 'b' are the same, hence all prime factors are common. Therefore, there are 2 common prime factors.

So the expression becomes:
1 + 2

Finally, by adding these results, we get the result 3.

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: First, note the order of operations PEFMDASC. 

Let's move step by step according to that:

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Prime Factors of 8 are: 2
Prime Factors of 2 are: 2
Common factors are: 2
Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1

Prime Factors of 6 are: 2 and 3
Common factors are: 2, 3
Therefore, 6 # 6 = 2

Mathematical Expression becomes : 1 + 2

Step 2: Addition (A)
Using the order of operation, after Prime Factor Counting (F), we need to perform Addition. 
1 + 2 = 3

There are no operations left to perform.

Therefore, ""The answer is 3."""
