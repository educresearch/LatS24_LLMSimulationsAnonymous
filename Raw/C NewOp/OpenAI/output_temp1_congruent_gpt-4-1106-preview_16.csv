6#6 involves finding the shared unique prime factors of 6 and itself, which are just the unique prime factors of 6. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, so 6#6 would count the unique prime factors that 6 has, which are 2 prime factors: 2 and 3.

The original problem:
6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3

Step 1: Deal with Parentheses (P)
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F) is next, but we have a concatenation operation before it in the expression, which we cannot evaluate until we have dealt with subtraction. Since there's no prime factor counting operation that can be performed without evaluating the subtraction first, we'll move on to that operation instead. 

Step 3: Since we can't do Prime Factor Counting (F) yet, we move to Addition and Subtraction (A/S). The subtraction to the right has to be evaluated before we can do the concatenation:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 10 # 3 (Subtraction before prime factor counting)

Step 4: Now that the subtraction has been performed, we can do the Prime Factor Counting between 10 and 3:

6 @ 18 + 10 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 0 (10 has prime factors 2 and 5, and 3 is a prime number, hence no shared prime factors)

Step 5: Addition (A), given the updated order and based on the fact that prime factor counting resulted in 0:

6 @ 18 + 0
= 6 @ 18

Step 6: Finally, we have Concatenation (C) which comes last:

6 @ 18
= 618

There are no other operations left to do, so the final answer to the problem based on the new order of operations is:

The answer is"

                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

3 is a prime number with a prime factor of 3.
2 is a prime number with a prime factor of 2.

Let's begin by evaluating the prime factor counting operations (F):

8#2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (since 8 can be factored into 2 * 2 * 2). The only prime factor of 2 is 2 itself. They share the prime factor of 2, so the count of unique prime factors shared is 1.

6#6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since we are comparing 6 with itself, the shared prime factors are 2 and 3. However, even though 2 and 3 are both prime factors of 6, we need to count only the unique prime factors shared. Since 6 shares all its prime factors with itself, but we are counting unique factors, the result is 1.

Now, let's substitute the prime factor counting results back into the expression:

8#2 + 6#6 = 1 + 1

The problem is given as: 6@(14+4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Let's apply the order of operations:

1. Parentheses: Evaluate expressions inside parentheses first.
\[ 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 \]

2. Prime Factor Counting (F): Next, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation.
The prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. They do not share any prime factors.
\[ 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 \]

3. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Perform addition and subtraction from left to right.
\[ 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 = 6 @ 18 + 12 \]

4. Concatenation (C): Lastly, we perform concatenation operation.
Keep in mind that concatenation takes the absolute values of the digits involved. Concatenating 6 with 18 results in 618.
\[ 6 @ 18 + 12 = 618 + 12 \]

Now add 618 and 12:
\[ 618 + 12 = 630 \]

The answer is 630."

1. Parentheses (P)

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S) (left to right)
6. Concatenation (C) (left to right)

Given problem: 5 + 2 @ 4

Since there are no parentheses, exponents, or prime factor counting involved, we move directly to step 5: Addition and Subtraction.

But before we can perform the addition, according to the updated order of operations, we must perform the concatenation (step 6) as it comes after the addition and subtraction in the new order.

Let's execute step 6 (Concatenation):

2 @ 4 = 24 (since we merge the digits of 2 and 4)

Now perform the addition:

5 + 24 = 29

The answer is 29."

8#2: The unique prime factors of 8 are 2, and the unique prime factors of 2 is 2. Therefore, the prime factors common to both 8 and 2 are just 2. This results in a prime factor count of 1.

6#6: The unique prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since both numbers are 6, their prime factors are the same: 2 and 3. This results in a prime factor count of 2, since there are two unique prime factors present in both numbers.

The problem now becomes: 
6@18 + 12−2 # 3

2. Prime Factor Counting (F):
Next, we count the unique prime factors common to |2| and |3|.

There are no common prime factors between 2 and 3.

Therefore, 2 # 3 = 0

The problem now simplifies to:

3. Concatenation (C):
Next, we perform the concatenation operation:

6@18 becomes 618

                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

Given problem: 5 + 3#2

We first need to perform the prime factor counting (F):

3#2: The prime factors of 3 are 3 itself, and the prime factors of 2 are 2 itself. There are no common prime factors, so 3#2 equals 0.

Following the order, the problem simplifies to:

5 + 0

Since addition comes next, we perform the addition:

5 + 0 = 5

So, the final answer is:

First, we'll calculate the prime factor counting (F) for each pair:

1. 8 # 2:
The absolute values of 8 and 2 are used, which are 8 and 2. Prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2 (or 2^3), and prime factors of 2 are just 2. They share one unique prime factor which is 2.
Hence, 8 # 2 = 1 (since there is only one shared prime factor, which is 2).

2. 6 # 6:
The absolute values of 6 and 6 are used, which are 6 and 6. Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and since the second number is the same, it obviously shares both prime factors.
Hence, 6 # 6 = 2 (since there are two shared prime factors, which are 2 and 3).

Step-by-Step Solution:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F)
   \(4 # 3\) calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 4 and 3.
   The prime factors of 4 are \(2 \times 2\).
   The prime factor of 3 is 3.
   They do not share any prime factors, so \(4 # 3 = 0\).

2. Addition (A)
   Now we simply add the result of the prime factor counting to 2.
   \(0 + 2 = 2\).

2. Exponents (E)

We need to count the unique prime factors shared between |2| and |3|. Both 2 and 3 are primes themselves, and since they are different, they do not share any common prime factors.

To find the unique prime factors that 3 and 2 share, we look at their prime factorization:
- 3 is a prime number, so its prime factors are just 3.
- 2 is a prime number, so its prime factors are just 2.
Since there are no shared prime factors (no factors in common), 3 # 2 equals 0.

2. 5 + 3 # 2
We can replace 3 # 2 with the result from step 1, which is 0.
