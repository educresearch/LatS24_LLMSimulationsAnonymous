First, we must perform the Prime Factor Counting operation (F), as it comes before Addition (A) in the order of operations PEFMDASC.

So we start with:
**Prime Factor Counting (F)**
1. \(8#2\) – Prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2, and the prime factor for 2 is 2. They share the prime factor 2.
2. \(6#6\) – Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and for the other 6 it’s the same 2 and 3. They share two prime factors: 2 and 3.

Now we carry out the Prime Factor Counting operation:
\(8#2 = 1\) (since 2 is the only unique shared prime factor)
\(6#6 = 2\) (since both 2 and 3 are the shared prime factors)

**Addition (A)**
\(8#2 + 6#6 = 1 + 2 = 3\)

The final answer to this problem, therefore, is \(3\).

The given expression is:
6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3

We first address the Parentheses (P):
6@18 + 12-2 # 3

Next, we handle Exponents (E), but since there are none, we move to Prime Factor counting (F):
6@18 + 12-2 # 3
Since 2 and 3 share the prime factor of 1:
2 # 3 = 1

Now we update the expression accordingly:
6@18 + 12 - 1

We don't have any Multiplication (M) or Division (D) to take care of, so we move on to Addition (A) and Subtraction (S):
6@18 + 11
We need to add 12 and -1 before we do any Concatenation:
6@29

Lastly, we carry out the Concatenation (C):
6 @ 29 = 629

                    Two new operations were defined:

                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):

                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)

First, let's find the shared unique prime factors for each Prime Factor Counting operation:

1. For 8 # 2:
- The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (which is 2^3).
- The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
- The unique shared prime factor is 2, and there is only one such shared prime factor.

So, 8 # 2 = 1

2. For 6 # 6:
- The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
- Since we're comparing the number with itself, the shared unique prime factors will be the same as the prime factors of 6.
- Since 6 has two unique prime factors (2 and 3), the count is 2.

So, 6 # 6 = 2

Now we combine these results following the order of operations, with Prime Factor Counting (F) first, then Addition (A):

First, we have a Prime Factor Counting operation and then an addition. Since there are no parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, subtraction, or concatenation to take care of, we will follow the sequence directly as given.

Prime Factor Counting (F) comes before Addition (A) according to the new order of operations.

The prime factors of 4 are 2 × 2.
The prime factors of 3 are 3.

There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3.

Thus, the prime factor counting operation gives us:

4 # 3 = 0

Now we perform the addition with the result from the prime factor counting:

0 + 2 = 2

Therefore, the final answer is:

Given expression: 6@(14+4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
Evaluate the expression within the parentheses first.

\( 14 + 4 = 18 \)

So, the expression becomes:

\( 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 \)

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents to evaluate in this expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Evaluate the prime factor counting next.

\( 2 # 3 \)

The number 2 has prime factors of just 2, and the number 3 has a prime factor of just 3. Since they share no common prime factors, the result is 0.

So, the expression becomes:

\( 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 \)

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
There is no multiplication or division to carry out in this expression.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.

First add \( 12 \) to \( 6 @ 18 \) and then subtract \( 0 \):

But before we add \( 12 \), we need to address concatenation because we have a concatenation operation between 6 and 18.

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
Perform the concatenation operation.

\( 6 @ 18 \) is the concatenation of 6 and 18, which gives us:

\( 6 @ 18 = 618 \)

Now the expression is as follows:

\( 618 + 12 - 0 \)

We can now perform addition and subtraction:

\( 618 + 12 = 630 \)
\( 630 - 0 = 630"

Here are the steps:

1. We need to first look for Parentheses, Exponents, and Prime Factor Counting, but none are present in this expression.
2. Next, we look for Multiplication and Division, but those are not present either.
3. We proceed with Addition and Subtraction operations, which are present (5 + 2).
4. Lastly, we handle Concatenation, which is also present (2 @ 4).

Solving it step by step:

1. Addition: 5 + 2 = 7
2. Concatenation: Since concatenation is ordered after addition, now we concatenate the result of the addition with the remaining number: 7 @ 4.

Concatenation means merging the digits, so we literally join the number 7 with the number 4, leading to:

The answer is 74."

For 8#2:
8 has prime factors 2 (2 x 2 x 2), and
2 has the prime factor 2.

Since 2 is the only prime factor they have in common, 8#2 = 1.

For 6#6:
6 has prime factors 2 and 3 (2 x 3), and
6 has the same prime factors.

Since both prime factors are common, 6#6 = 2 because we are counting the unique prime factors.

1. Solve the expression within the parentheses first: (14 + 4)
2. Evaluate any prime factor counting (F)
3. Perform multiplication and division from left to right (if any)
4. Carry out addition and subtraction from left to right
5. Apply concatenation (C) from left to right

Now, let's apply these steps to the problem:

First, solve the parentheses (PE):

- 2 # 3

Next, solve the prime factor counting (F):
2 # 3 = 0 (because the prime factors of 2 are {2} and the prime factors of 3 are {3}, no shared prime factors)
6@18

- 0

Now let's operate the addition and subtraction (A/S):

                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a@b = |a|@|b| = |12|@|-56| = 12@56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a@b = 0@24 = 024 = 24.
                    Please make sure you understand this properly; it's simple yet fundamental.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted as a#b, it counts the unique prime factors common to |a| and |b|. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

5 + 3#2

Here, we have an addition and a prime factor counting operation. The prime factor counting should be performed before the addition as per the updated rules.

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
We need to find the unique prime factors of |3| and |2| and count how many they have in common.

- The prime factors of 3 are just 3 because it is a prime number.
- The prime factors of 2 are just 2 because it is a prime number.

Since they do not share any prime factors (3 is not a prime factor of 2, and 2 is not a prime factor of 3), the result of the prime factor counting operation is 0.

Step 2: Addition (A)
Now we perform the addition with the result from the prime factor counting:

5 + (3#2)
= 5 + 0
= 5

Therefore, we have our final answer:

The answer is 5."

Step 1: Since there are no parentheses, exponents, prime factor counting, multiplication, or division to consider, we move directly to addition and subtraction.
Step 2: However, according to the new order of operations, concatenation (C) comes after addition/subtraction. So we first perform the concatenation before the addition.

We perform the concatenation of 2 and 4:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F) comes before Addition (A).

First, we count the unique prime factors for each pair, starting with 8#2:
- The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (since 8 = 2^3).
- The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
The shared prime factor between 8 and 2 is 2. Since it's shared, we count it once, so 8#2 = 1.

Next, we calculate 6#6:
- The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 (since 6 = 2 x 3).
- The prime factors of the other 6 are the same, 2 and 3.
There are two shared prime factors, 2 and 3, so 6#6 = 2.

2. Addition (A)

Now we add the results of the prime factor counting:
1 (from 8#2) + 2 (from 6#6) = 3

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Before we do the addition, we need to count the unique shared prime factors between 4 and 3.

- The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (or just 2 as a unique factor).
- The prime factors of 3 are just 3.
Since 4 and 3 have no shared prime factors, we get:
4 # 3 = 0

Step 2: Addition (A)
Now that we have the result of the prime factor counting, we can add 2 to it:
0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2."

1. Parentheses (P):
   First, we evaluate the expression inside the parenthesis.
   \( 14 + 4 = 18 \)

   So the expression becomes:
   \( 6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3 \)

2. Prime Factor Counting (F):
   Next, we perform prime factor counting on 2 and 3.

   The prime factors of 2 are {2}, and the prime factors of 3 are {3}. They have no shared prime factors.
   \(2 # 3 = 0\)

   Now the expression is:
   \( 6@18 + 12 - 0 \)

3. Exponents (E):
   There are no exponents to evaluate in this expression.

4. Multiplication/Division (M/D):
   There are no multiplication or division operations to evaluate in this expression.

5. Addition/Subtraction (A/S):
   Perform the subtraction next, since addition and subtraction are of the same precedence and we go from left to right.
   \( 12 - 0 = 12 \)

   Now the expression is:
   \( 6@18 + 12 \)

6. Concatenation (C):
   Finally, we perform the concatenation of 6 with 18:
   \( 6@18 = 618 \)

   Now we add 12 to 618:
   \( 618 + 12 = 630 \)

So, step-by-step, we have:

\( 6@(14+4) + 12 - 2 # 3 \\
6@18 + 12 - 0 \( \( (Prime Factor Counting) \) \\
618 + 12 \( \( (Concatenation) \) \\
