gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: Following the order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to apply the Prime Factor Counting operation before moving on to addition.

First, let's evaluate each Prime Factor Counting operation:

1. \( 8 \# 2 \): 
The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (since \( 8 = 2^3 \)).
The prime factors of 2 is just 2.
Since both numbers share the prime factor 2, \( 8 \# 2 = 1 \) (they share one unique prime factor).

2. \( 6 \# 6 \):
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 (since \( 6 = 2 \times 3 \)).
For the second 6, the prime factors are the same, 2 and 3.
Since both numbers share the prime factors 2 and 3, \( 6 \# 6 = 2 \) (there are two unique shared prime factors).

Now we perform the addition:

\( 8 \# 2 + 6 \# 6 = 1 + 2 = 3 \).

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: According to the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to apply the Prime Factor Counting operation before addition. 

Calculating the prime factors of both 4 and 3:

- The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (or just 2, since we consider unique prime factors).
- The prime factors of 3 is 3.

Since 4 and 3 do not share any prime factors, the Prime Factor Counting operation (F) results in:

\(4 # 3 = 0 \) (no shared unique prime factors)

Now we can proceed with the addition:

\(0 + 2 = 2\)

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: Let's break down the expression using the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

Given expression: 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses
Evaluate the expression inside parentheses first.
14 + 4 = 18

Now, the expression becomes:
6@18 + 12-2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents
There are no exponents to evaluate.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting
We need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation between 2 and 3. The prime factors of 2 are just 2, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3. Since there are no common prime factors, 2 # 3 equals 0.

Now the expression becomes:
6@18 + 12-0

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (From Left to Right)
There are no multiplication or division operations to evaluate.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (From Left to Right)
We now perform the addition and subtraction operations, from left to right.
12 - 0 = 12

Now the expression becomes:
6@18 + 12

Step 6: Concatenation (From Left to Right, after all other operations)
Finally, we perform the concatenation operation. We start with 6@18 which results in 618.

Now, add 12 to the number from the concatenation:
618 + 12 = 630

The whole evaluated expression will now be:

2. Compute Exponents.
3. Perform Prime Factor Counting (F).
4. Carry out Multiplication (M) and Division (D) from left to right.
5. Do Addition (A) and Subtraction (S) from left to right.
6. Apply Concatenation (C) from left to right.

The expression given is 5 + 2 @ 4. There are no parentheses, exponents, or prime factor counting to perform. According to the new rules, we perform the addition before concatenation.

1. Perform addition between 5 and 2: 5 + 2 = 7.
2. Apply concatenation to the result and 4: 7 @ 4.

The absolute values do not affect the result in this case, as there are no negative numbers.

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve the problem using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (#) before moving on to Addition (A).

Given the expression:
8 # 2 + 6 # 6

We first do the prime factor counting for each pair:
- The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or 2^3).
- The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
- The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
- The prime factors of another 6 are also 2 and 3.

Now, we count the unique shared prime factors between each pair:
- For 8 and 2, the shared prime factor is 2.
- For 6 and 6, this is the same number, so the shared prime factors are 2 and 3. But since we only count unique prime factors once, we count 2 and 3 once each.

So,
8 # 2 = 1 (because the prime factor 2 is shared)
6 # 6 = 2 (because the prime factors 2 and 3 are shared)

Now we apply these results to the addition:
8 # 2 + 6 # 6
= 1 + 2

Firstly, we need to consider the Prime Factor counting (F) operation before addition (A). 

4 # 3 denotes the number of unique prime factors that 4 and 3 have in common. The prime factors for 4 are 2 (since \(4 = 2^2\)) and the prime factors for 3 is just 3 (since 3 is a prime number). There are no common prime factors, hence:

6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3

First, we handle the parentheses (P):
6@(18) + 12-2  #  3

Next, we look for prime factor counting (F) before moving on to any other operations:
Since there is no concatenation or exponentiation before the prime factor counting, we can evaluate it next.
6@(18) + 12-0  (since the prime factors of 2 are just 2, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3, there are no shared prime factors)

Now, we proceed to addition (A) and subtraction (S) (from left to right), but before that, we must handle the concatenation (C) as it is higher in the order than addition/subtraction.

We begin with the concatenation, since it must be performed before the addition and subtraction (based on the updated order of operations):
6 @ 18 + 12-0
618 + 12-0

Now we perform addition and subtraction from left to right:
630 - 0
630

The final answer is 630.

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in the expression.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents in the expression.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We need to count the number of unique prime factors shared by 3 and 2.

The prime factors of 3 are just 3 itself, since it is a prime number.
The prime factors of 2 are just 2 itself, since it is a prime number.
There are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, so 3#2 equals 0.

1. For the term 8#2:
Prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or 2^3).

Thus, the prime factors common to both 8 and 2 are just one factor: 2. So, 8#2 = 1.

2. For the term 6#6:
Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
Since we are looking at 6#6, the prime factorization is the same for both.
Thus, the prime factors common to both numbers are 2 and 3. There are 2 unique prime factors. So, 6#6 = 2.

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
4. Multiplication/Division (M/D)
5. Addition/Subtraction (A/S)
6. Concatenation (C)

The given problem is: \( 6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3 \)

Let's start with the parentheses:

\( 14+4 = 18 \)

So the problem simplifies to:

\( 6@18 + 12 - 2  #  3 \)

Next, we apply Prime Factor Counting:

The prime factors of 2 are simply {2} and the prime factors of 3 are {3}, with no shared prime factors. Therefore:

\( 2  #  3 = 0 \)

The problem now simplifies to:

\( 6@18 + 12 - 0 \)

Next, there's no multiplication or division to take care of, so we move on to addition and subtraction:

\( 12 - 0 = 12 \)

Now we are left with:

\( 6@18 + 12 \)

Finally, we apply the concatenation:

\( 6@18 \) will merge the digits of 6 and 18:

\( 6@18 = 618 \)

Now we simply add what's left:

\( 618 + 12 = 630 \)

Given expression: 8#2 + 6#6

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)

First, we count the unique prime factors shared between 8 and 2, and then between 6 and 6.

Prime factors of 8: 2
Prime factors of 2: 2
Since both numbers share the prime factor 2, we count it once:
8#2 = 1

Now, let's count the prime factors of 6:
Prime factors of 6: 2, 3
Since 6 is being compared with itself, all its prime factors are shared:
6#6 = 2 (since both 2 and 3 are shared)

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, which counts as one unique prime factor since repetition is not considered.
The prime factors of 3 are just 3 itself.
Since there is no shared prime factor between 4 and 3, the operation 4 # 3 results in 0.

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
We first perform the operation in parentheses: (14 + 4)
6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3
= 6@(18) + 12-2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents in the expression, so we skip this step.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Now, we have to execute the prime factor counting operation: 2 # 3
2 and 3 are both prime numbers, and they do not share any prime factors, so the result is 0.
6@18 + 12-2 # 3
= 6@18 + 12-0

Step 4: Multiplication/Division (M/D)
There are no multiplication or division operations to perform, so we move on to the next step.

Step 5: Addition/Subtraction (A/S)
Prior to performing addition, we need to handle the concatenation step since it now comes after addition/subtraction in the updated order of operations.

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
We concatenate 6 and 18: 6@18
Please note that concatenation is performed after addition or subtraction when they occur in the sequence without parentheses. Since the addition comes inside the parentheses, we concatenate first in this case.

Step 7: Continuing with Addition/Subtraction (A/S) as per the updated order
We perform the remaining addition and subtraction operations:
618 + 12 - 0
