gpt-4-0613,1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: Based on the new rules of operation, we first perform the prime factor counting operation (#), and then the addition operation.

4#3 = 0, since 4 and 3 do not share any prime factors.

Then, we perform the addition operation.

0 + 2 = 2

So, the result of 4#3 + 2 is 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: The problem is 4#3 + 2.

First we calculate the prime count operation (F). The prime factors of 4 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 is 3. They do not share any prime number so counting gives us 0.

Then the equation becomes:

0 + 2

Finally, we add them to get 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: In the given math problem, you first need to perform the Prime Factor counting operation (F) because according to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, F comes before addition.

Starting with 4#3:
Prime factors of 4 are 2, and prime factors of 3 are 3. They have no shared prime factors, hence 4#3 = 0

The modified problem becomes: 
0 + 2
Perform the operation:

So, the final answer to the problem 4#3 + 2 using the new operations and order of operations is 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: The given mathematical expression is: 4#3 + 2

First, follow the revised Order of Operations (PEFMDASC). ""P"" (Parentheses) and ""E"" (Exponents) are not applicable in this case, so we move on to ""F"" (Prime Factor Counting). 

We perform the operation 4 # 3. The prime factor of 4 is 2 and the prime factor of 3 is 3. As these two numbers do not share any prime factors, 4 # 3 = 0.

So, we rewrite the equation as: 0 + 2.

Next, since we have only addition operation left, we calculate 0 + 2 which equals to 2.

So, the answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: Based on the new rules of operation, we should perform the addition before the concatenation.

gpt-4-0613,1,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: Based on the new rules of operation, the prime factor counting operation (#) should be performed first before the addition operation.

Let's start by performing the prime factor counting (#) operation:

- The number 3 has one prime factor, i.e., 3.
- The number 2 has one prime factor, i.e., 2.
- These two numbers share no common prime factor.

So, 3 # 2 = 0

The next step is to perform the addition operation:

5 + 0 = 5

Thus, the final answer to the mathematics problem 5 + 3 # 2, considering the updated order of operations, is 5.

So, the answer is 5.","GPT Response: Following the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

First we calculate the prime count operation (F):
This gives 3 # 2 = 1 (since 3 and 2 share one prime factor which is itself).

We then have: 5 + 1

Finally, we calculate the addition:
This gives 5 + 1 = 6

Therefore, the result is 6.

""The answer is 6.""","GPT Response: In the given math problem, you have the operations addition and prime factor counting.

Given our Order of Operations (PEFMDASC), we solve Prime Factor Counting (F) before Addition (A):

Starting with 3 # 2, 3 and 2 are both primes and thus, they do not share any common factor. Hence, 3 # 2 = 0

The expression now becomes: 5 + 0
Performing the addition, we get 5 + 0 = 5

So, the answer is 5.","GPT Response: The given mathematical expression is: 5+3 # 2, where # denotes the prime factor counting operation.

We use the revised order of operations PEFMDASC, where the first step is Parentheses (P), but there aren't any parenthetical expressions in the given equation. 

The next step is Exponents (E), also not applicable here.

After that, we have Prime Factor Counting (F), which applies in our case.

So, we start with the expression 3 # 2. The prime factor of 3 is 3 itself and the prime factor of 2 is 2 itself. There are no shared unique prime factors between 3 and 2, so 3 # 2 equals 0.

Thus, our equation becomes: 5 + 0, keeping in mind the revised order of operations (PEFMDASC), next in line is Addition/Subtraction.

Performing the addition operation, we get: 5 + 0 = 5.

gpt-4-0613,1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Based on the given problem and according to the PEFMDASC order, the procedure is as follows:

We start by simplifying what's inside the parentheses, followed by the prime factor counting operation and the subtraction.

6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3 
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3 (simplify inside parentheses 14+4 = 18)
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 (since prime factor of 3 are [3], and prime factor of 2 are [2]. Hence there are no shared prime factor, i.e., 2#3 = 0)
= 618 + 12 - 0
= 630 - 0 (using addition before subtraction)
= 630 (since 630 - 0 = 630)

Hence the final answer to the problem within the context of new operations and order of operations is 630.
""The answer is 630.""","GPT Response: First, evaluate what is in the parenthesis according to the order of operations (PEFMDASC). So, 14 + 4 = 18. 

So we get: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, perform the prime factor counting operation (F), since according to the new rules it is done before addition and subtraction. The prime factors of 2 and 3 don't have any in common, so 2 # 3 = 0.

So we get: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Then, perform the addition operation (A) according to the new rules.

So, we get: 6 @ 18 + 12 = 6 @ 30

Finally, perform the concatenation operation (C), which according to the updated rules is done last.

So, 6 @ 30 = 630.

So, the answer to the given problem 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3 according to the new mathematical operation rules is 630.

Therefore, the answer is 630.","GPT Response: First, we evaluate the expression in parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18.

So now, the expression is: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Afterwards, we count the shared unique prime factors between 2 and 3 using the F operation. Given that 2 is prime and 3 is also prime, there is no shared prime factor, so 2#3 equals 0.

So now, the expression is: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 

Solving from left to right according to the order of operations (PEFMDASC), we perform the addition operation next: 12 - 0 = 12

So now the expression is: 6 @ 18 + 12 

Again, according to the order of operations (PEFMDASC), we perform the concatenation: 

So now the expression is: 618 + 12 

Lastly, add 618 and 12 to obtain the final result: 618 + 12 = 630

The answer is 630.","GPT Response: To solve the expression, we need to follow the PEFMDASC order of operations.

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
In our case: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
Let's solve parentheses:
14 + 4 = 18 

We then replace (14+4) in the expression with 18. The updated expression is now:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Let's calculate the prime factors in the expression: 2#3
The unique prime factors of |2| are 2
The unique prime factors of |3| are 3
They do not share any prime number.
So, 2 # 3 = 0 

We replace 2 # 3 in the expression with 0.
The expression becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Steps 3 & 4: Exponentiation, Multiplication, and Division (E, M/D)
There are no exponentiations, multiplications, or divisions in the new expression, so we proceed to the next step.

Step 5: Addition & Subtraction (A/S)
From left to right:
Firstly, let's perform addition 18 + 12 = 30

So the updated expression becomes:
6 @ 30 - 0

Now, let's perform the subtraction operation 30 - 0 = 30

So, the updated expression becomes:
6 @ 30

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
Now it's time for the Concatenation operation
6 @ 30 = 630

Let's replace 6 @ 30 in our expression with 630:
The answer is 630."
gpt-4-0613,1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: According to the newly updated order of operations, the prime factorization operation (#) and the addition operation (+) need to be evaluated first, where the prime factorisation operation (#) has higher precedence.

The prime factors of 8 are 2, and the prime factors of 2 are 2, so 8 # 2 = 1 because they share one prime factor, 2.

Similarly, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 and the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, so 6 # 6 = 2 because they share two prime factors, 2 and 3.

Now, replacing these values in the problem, we have: 1 + 2.

The answer to the problem is 1 + 2 = 3.

Therefore, The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Firstly, we will perform the prime factor counting operation (F). 

Here are the prime factors of the numbers:
Prime factors of 8 are: 2 (because 8=2×2×2)
Prime factors of 2 are: 2 
Prime factors of 6 are: 2, 3

Now, according to the operation rules:
8 # 2 implies the count of unique prime factors shared by 8 and 2, which is 1 (because both 8 and 2 have the common prime factor 2)
6 # 6 implies the count of unique prime factors in 6, which is 2 (since 6 has two primes, 2 and 3)

So, our equation: 
8 # 2+6 # 6 = 1 + 2 = 3

Therefore:
The answer is 3.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we will use the PEFMDASC order of operations, where P stands for Parentheses, E for Exponents, F for Prime Factor Counting, M/D for Multiplication and Division from left to right, A/S for Addition and Subtraction from left to right, and C for Concatenation.

So, the order of operations would begin with Prime Factor Counting (F), then Addition (A).

Here are the steps:

Step 1: Evaluate 8 # 2
The prime factors of 8 are 2 (2*2*2), and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since they share one prime factor (2), 8 # 2 = 1.

Step 2: Evaluate 6 # 6
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since they share two prime factors (2 and 3), 6 # 6 = 2.

Step 3: Add the results
Now, add the results of these operations (1+2), which equals to 3.

So, 8 # 2+6 # 6 = 3.

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6, we need to follow the updated order of operations, which is PEFMDASC.

F stands for Prime Factor Counting, and we identify two of these operations in the expression. So, we calculate these first.

8 # 2 = |8| # |2| = 8 # 2. The prime factors of 8 are 2, and for 2 also it is 2. So, they share one prime factor, so 8 # 2 = 1.

6 # 6 = |6| # |6| = 6 # 6. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and for 6 it is also 2 and 3. So they share both prime factors. However, prime factor counting only counts unique values, so 6 # 6 = 2.

Now, our expression looks like: 1 + 2.

Next, according to the order of operations, we perform Addition (A). 

1 + 2 = 3.

So, the answer is 3."
