                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.

systemPrompt1_userPrompt2_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Let's evaluate the given expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 step by step, following the new order of operations PEFMDASC.

1. Evaluate prime factor counting (F) first before any addition or subtraction:
   
   a. The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2.
   b. The prime factors of 2 are 2.
   c. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.

Since 8 and 2 share the prime factor 2 (in fact, 2 is the only prime factor of 2), 8 # 2 will give us 1, because there's one unique prime factor that they share.

Similarly, since 6 (prime factors: 2 and 3) is being compared with itself (6 # 6), it shares all its prime factors with itself. However, we only count each prime factor once, so 6 # 6 will also give us 1, because there's one unique prime factor that they share (2 and 3 count as two unique prime factors altogether, but since they are compared within the same number it is still only a single unique prime factor that they share.)

2. Now we add the results of the prime factor counting operations:

   a. 8 # 2 (which is 1)
   b. 6 # 6 (which is 1)

So now the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 becomes:

1 + 1 = 2

3. Since we've evaluated the prime factor counting and there are no other operations left, the final result of the expression is 2.

The answer is 2."

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

First, we need to deal with the parentheses (P):

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we look for exponents (E), but there are none in this expression. We move on to prime factor counting (F):

The prime factors of 2 are just 2, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3. There are no shared prime factors, so 2 # 3 is 0.

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Now we proceed with any multiplication (M) and division (D), but we have none here. After that, we move to addition (A) and subtraction (S):

6 @ 18 + 12
= 6 @ 30

Finally, we have the concatenation (C). We will concatenate the numbers as per the operation's rules:

6 @ 30
= 630

So the final answer is:
The answer is 630."

                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e.,

                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

The prime factor counting operation, represented as a # b, counts the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of a and b.

For the first operation:

8 # 2:
- The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or just 2 if considering only unique factors).
- The prime factor of 2 is 2.
- Both numbers share the prime factor 2, so the result of the operation is 1 because there is only one unique shared prime factor.

6 # 6:
- The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
- For the second 6, the prime factors are also 2 and 3.
- Both numbers share the prime factors 2 and 3, so the result of the operation is 2 because there are two unique shared prime factors.

The problem is: 4 # 3 + 2

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): We need to evaluate the prime factor counting between 4 and 3 before we do the addition.

   The prime factors of 4 are 2 (as 4 = 2^2).
   The prime factor of 3 is 3 itself (as 3 is a prime number).

   Since 4 and 3 do not share any common prime factors, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 0.

   Thus, 4 # 3 = 0.

2. Addition (A): After evaluating the prime factor counting, we simply add the result to 2.

   So, 0 + 2 = 2.

Therefore, the final answer to the given problem is 2.

The answer is 2."

Problem: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
First, we calculate the expression inside the parentheses:

14 + 4 = 18

So the expression becomes:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponent operations in this expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
We have the prime factor counting operation 2 # 3. Let's calculate it:

The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
The prime factors of 3 are just 3.
Since they don't have any shared prime factors, 2 # 3 equals 0.

Now, the expression becomes:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
There is no multiplication or division to perform.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Now we perform addition and subtraction from left to right:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 = 6 @ (18 + 12) - 0
                 = 6 @ 30 - 0

There is no subtraction to do here, as subtracting 0 won't change the value.

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
Finally, perform the concatenation operation:

6 @ 30 = 630

So the final answer is:

The answer is 630."

5. **Addition (A) and Subtraction (S)** - We have an addition operation here.
6. **Concatenation (C)** - Lastly, perform any concatenation.

According to the order of operations, we must perform addition before concatenation:

5 + 2 = 7

After dealing with the addition, we apply the concatenation:
 
7 @ 4

Concatenation merges the digits of 7 and 4 to form a single number:
 
7 @ 4 = 74

First, we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F):

Prime factors of 8 are: 2 * 2 * 2
Prime factors of 2 are: 2
Thus 8 # 2 = 1 (Only one common prime factor, which is 2)

Prime factors of 6 are: 2 * 3
Thus 6 # 6 = 2 (There are two prime factors in 6, and since both numbers are the same, all prime factors are common, which are 2 and 3)

(14 + 4) = 18

New expression: 
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Solve Prime Factor Counting (F).
Since 2 and 3 share a prime factor, which is 2:
2 # 3 = 1

5 + 3 # 2

According to PEFMDASC, we need to evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) before we do the Addition (A).

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F) for 3 # 2. 
- The prime factor of 3 is 3 itself.
- The prime factor of 2 is 2 itself.
- Since there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, the result of 3 # 2 is 0.

So, the equation becomes:
5 + 0

Step 2: Perform Addition (A):
5 + 0 = 5

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): We need to count the unique shared prime factors of the absolute values of 4 and 3.

    - Prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
    - Prime factors of 3 is 3.
    - They have no shared prime factors.

   Therefore, \( 4 # 3 = 0 \).

2. Addition (A):

- The prime factors of 3 are 3, and there's only one prime factor, which is 3 itself.
- The prime factors of 2 are 2, and there's only one prime factor, which is 2 itself.

Since there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, \( 3 \# 2 = 0 \).
