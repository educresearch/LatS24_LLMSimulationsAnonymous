1. Parentheses – There are no parentheses to deal with.
2. Exponents – There are no exponents to deal with.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F) – There is no prime factor counting operation in the expression.
4. Multiplication (M) and Division (D) – There is no multiplication or division to deal with.
5. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S) – We have an addition, but it has to be evaluated after the concatenation since concatenation is the last operation to be performed.
6. Concatenation (C) – We perform the concatenation operation first in this case.

We have the concatenation operation 2 @ 4, which should be done before the addition because concatenation comes last in the order of operations, even after addition.

The concatenation of 2 and 4 would be 24. Now we just need to add 5 to the result.

Performing the remaining operation:
5 + 24 = 29

So the final answer to the expression is 29.

The answer is 29."

Given Expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
First, let's evaluate the expression inside the parentheses.

\( 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 \\
= 6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 # 3 \)

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Now we look for any prime factor counting operations to evaluate.

\( 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 \)

The prime factors of 2 are {2} and the prime factors of 3 are {3}. They do not share any prime factors, so:

\( 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 \)

Step 3: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
There is no multiplication or division to evaluate.

Step 4: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
However, to follow the order of operations correctly, we must remember to perform any addition or subtraction before we perform the concatenation operation. Therefore, we do the addition and subtraction next.

\( 6 @ 18 + 12 \\
= 6 @ (18 + 12) \\
= 6 @ 30 \)

Step 5: Concatenation (C)
Finally, we perform the concatenation operation.

\( 6 @ 30 \\
= 630 \)

So the final answer is:

The answer is 630."

                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e.,

                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

1. Parentheses (P) – There are no parentheses in our expression, so we can move on to the next operation.
2. Exponents (E) – There are no exponents in our expression, so we continue to the next operation.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F) – We have the expression 4 # 3, which requires us to count the number of unique prime factors shared by 4 and 3.

The prime factors of 4 are 2 x 2.
The prime factors of 3 are 3.
There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so 4 # 3 = 0.

4. Multiplication/Division (M/D) – There is no multiplication or division to be done in our expression.
5. Addition/Subtraction (A/S) – We need to perform addition: 0 (from the prime factor counting) + 2.

0 + 2 = 2

Next, we handle prime factor counting (F):
2 # 3 = 0 because there are no common prime factors between 2 and 3.

The expression now becomes:

Next, we handle addition and subtraction (left to right):

Since subtraction is next in the order (left to right) and we're subtracting zero, it will not change the result:

systemPrompt3_userPrompt1_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Let's use the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC) to solve the given problem: 5 + 2 @ 4.

First, we evaluate any Parentheses (P) or Exponents (E), but in this expression, there are none.

Then, we proceed to Prime Factor Counting (F), but since there are no # signs in the expression, we skip this.

Next, we perform any Multiplication (M) and Division (D) from left to right. Again, there are none present in the expression.

We then move on to Addition (A) and Subtraction (S). However, according to the updated order of operations, we must evaluate Concatenation (C) *after* Addition and Subtraction, not before.

So the correct order is:

1. Perform the Concatenation operation: 2 @ 4 = 24.
2. Then perform the Addition: 5 + 24 = 29.

So the correct steps are:
5 + 2 @ 4
= 5 + 24 (performing concatenation)
= 29 (performing addition)

The answer is 29."

The operation # denotes Prime Factor Counting and takes priority over addition according to the new order of operations.

Given problem:
8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Step 1: Evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F):
8 # 2:
The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (since 8 = 2^3). The prime factors of 2 are obviously just 2. So they have one unique common prime factor, which is 2.

6 # 6:
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since we're comparing the same number (6 # 6), it clearly has the common unique prime factors: 2 and 3.

So, we have 8 # 2 = 1 and 6 # 6 = 2 (because they have two common unique prime factors, 2 and 3).

Step 2: Perform the addition using the results from step 1:
1 (from 8 # 2) + 2 (from 6 # 6) = 3

Therefore, the final answer to the problem 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 is:

1. Parentheses (P)
   First, we calculate the expression within the parentheses:
   14 + 4 = 18

   So the expression becomes:
   6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Exponents (E)
   There are no exponents to calculate in this expression.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
   Next, we find the shared unique prime factors of 2 and 3:
   Prime factors of 2: 2
   Prime factors of 3: 3
   Since they do not share any prime factors, 2 # 3 = 0

   The expression now is:

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D)
   No multiplication or division operations are present next in the order.

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
   We can now perform the addition and subtraction in the expression from left to right:

Let's do this step by step:

1. Evaluate \(8 \# 2\):
   The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or \(2^3\)). 
   The prime factor of 2 is 2.
   The shared prime factor is 2.
   Therefore, the count of unique shared prime factors is 1.

   So, \(8 \# 2\) becomes \(1\).

2. Evaluate \(6 \# 6\):
   The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
   Since they are the same number, the shared unique prime factors are also 2 and 3.
   However, we are counting unique prime factors, so the number of shared unique prime factors is 2.

   So, \(6 \# 6\) becomes \(2\).

3. Add the results of the prime factor counting:
   According to the new operation of prime factor counting, we will add \(1\) to \(2\), which gives us:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): We first evaluate the prime factor counting operation, which is denoted by the # sign. We have to find the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 4 and 3.

The prime factors of 4 are 2 (since 4 = 2 * 2).
The prime factors of 3 are 3 (since 3 is a prime number by itself).

There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3.

So, 4 # 3 = 0

2. Addition (A): Next, we perform addition.

Now the expression is simplified to 0 + 2. 

We then add 0 to 2, which gives us 2.

The answer is 2."

Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Parentheses (P):** 
   First, we solve the expression inside the parentheses.
   \( (14 + 4) = 18 \)

2. **No Exponents (E) present,** so we can move to the next step.

3. **Prime Factor Counting (F):**
   Since we do not have a prime factor within parentheses or multiplication/division to work through yet, we will apply the prime factor counting next:
   \( 2 # 3 \)
   The prime factors of 2 are just 2, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3. There are no shared prime factors, so:
   \( 2 # 3 = 0 \)

4. **No Multiplication/Division (M/D) at this stage,** so we move to the next operations.

5. **Addition/Subtraction (A/S):**
   We can add and subtract in the order they appear from left to right but after we have handled the prime factor counting.
   The only subtraction operation we have is affected by the prime factor counting result.
   \( 12 - (2 # 3) \)
   We already calculated \( 2 # 3 = 0 \), so:
   \( 12 - 0 = 12 \)

6. **Concatenation (C):**
   Now, we only have one concatenation operation remaining:
   \( 6 @ 18 \)
   Concatenation joins the numbers together:
   \( 6 @ 18 = 618 \)

7. **Putting it all together:**
   \( 6 @ (14 + 4) \) has become \( 618 \) and"
