      <td>GPT Response: First, we compute the Prime Factor Counting (F) operations, as they are now higher precedence than addition.<br><br>For the first term, 8#2, the unique prime factors of 8 are [2] and of 2 are [2].

      <td>GPT Response: According to the PEFMDASC order of operations, this equation is solved as follows:<br><br>Step 1: Calculate the Prime Factor counting (F) operations. <br><br>(i) First, consider 8#2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, and the prime factors of 2 are also 2. Hence, there is one common prime factor. Therefore, 8#2 = 1.<br><br>(ii) Next, consider 6#6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the same holds for the other 6 as well. Hence, here also, all prime factors are common. Hence, the number of unique shared prime factors is 2 (i.e., 2 and 3). Therefore, 6#6 = 2.<br><br>So, the equation now becomes: 1 + 2.<br><br>Step 2: Evaluate the addition (A): Now, calculate the sum as per standard arithmetic.
