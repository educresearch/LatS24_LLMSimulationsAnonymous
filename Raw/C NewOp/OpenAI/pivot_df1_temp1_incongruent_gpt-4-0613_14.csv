gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: Based on the new order of operations PEFMDASC, addition operation comes before the concatenation operation. 

Therefore, the given mathematical expression will be solved as follows: 

First, perform the addition;
5 + 2 = 7.

Then, perform the concatenation;
7 @ 4 = 74. 

So, the final answer is 74.

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: Firstly, the prime factor counting operation should be performed according to the PEFMDASC rule.

The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2 and 2. The prime factor of 2 is 2.
Hence, 8 # 2 = 1 because 2 is the only prime number they share.

Next, the prime factor of 6 is 2 and 3. So, 6 # 6 = 2 because they share both prime factors 2 and 3.

Substitute the results back into the expression:
8 # 2+6 # 6 = 1 + 2

Finally, perform the addition:
1 + 2 = 3

Therefore, the final answer is 3.

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: Step 1: Evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operation first. The prime factors of |4| are 2, and there is no prime factor in |3|. So, 4#3 = 0.

Step 2: Then evaluate the addition operation. So, 0 + 2 = 2.

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: First, we apply the Parentheses first rule, so we add 14 + 4 = 18:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Although normally we would go from left to right, the new order of operations mandates that we work out the prime factor counting next. The prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. There are no shared prime factors, so 2#3 = 0:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Now, remembering that subtraction is resolved before concatenation, we subtract 0 from 12 to get:

6 @ 18 + 12

Finally, we perform the concatenation and addition operations, going from left to right:

618 + 12 = 630

Therefore, the answer is 630."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: Step 1: Evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operation first. The prime factors of |3| are 3, and the prime factors of |2| are 2; they do not share any prime factors. Therefore, 3 # 2 = 0.
The equation now becomes:

5 + 0

Step 2: Perform the Addition operation. 5 + 0 = 5.

So, The answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: Given the operation 5 + 2 @ 4, we analyze this expression based on the PEFMDASC order of operations.

No parenthesis (P), exponents (E), prime factor counting (F), multiplication or division (M/D), subtraction (S). 

So, we first perform addition (A). We have 5 + 2 = 7.

Next, we perform concatenation (C). We now have the expression 7 @ 4.

Based on the definition of concatenation, these numbers are concatenated to form a single number, which is 74.

Therefore, the solution to the problem 5 + 2 @ 4 is 74.

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: Firstly, we need to evaluate the operation F (prime factor counting), then addition according to the PEFMDASC order of operations. 

So, let's start with the prime factor counting:

8 # 2 = 1 (since the only common prime factor between 8 and 2 is 2)
6 # 6 = 1 (since the only common prime factor between 6 and 6 is 3)

The expression now becomes:

1 + 1

Finally, add the remaining numbers:

1 + 1 = 2

Although it is not explicitly stated in your problem, the interpretation is as follows:

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: Given 4#3 + 2

First according to the order of operations, we need to do the Prime Factor Counting (F).

The prime factors of 4 are [2], and the prime factors of 3 are [3].  Hence there are no shared prime factors.

So 4#3 = 0. 

Therefore, the expression becomes 0 + 2.

Now we simply add 0 and 2, which equals 2.

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: First according to the order of operations, we solve the terms in the parentheses:

14 + 4 = 18

Now our expression looks like this:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Next, we need to compute the prime factor counting operation:

2#3 = 1 (since both numbers have 2 as a shared prime factor)

Now we can substitute this value back in:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

Using the order of operations, we will then need to perform the addition:

18 + 12 = 30

Substitute this back into the equation:

6 @ 30 - 1

Next step is subtraction:

30 - 1 = 29

Substitute it back into the equation:

6 @ 29

Finally, we perform the concatenation operation:

6 @ 29 = 629

So, the answer is 629."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: Given 5+3 # 2, 

Here, we analyze 3 # 2 first according to the PEFMDASC order of operations. 

The operation 3 # 2 represents Prime Factor Counting. The prime factors of 3 are: 3, and the prime factors of 2 are: 2. Since there is no common prime factors, 3 # 2 = 0. 

Substituting 3 # 2 with its value, our expression becomes:

7 @ 4 = 74

So, the answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: Based on the newly updated order of operations PEFMDASC, the steps would be:

(i) Evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F).

8 # 2 = 1 (since prime factors of 8 are 2 and the prime factor of 2 is 2, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)
6 # 6 = 1 (since prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 and we are comparing it to itself, i.e., there is 1 shared prime factor)

(i) Resolve Parentheses first:
6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

(ii) Prime Factor Counting (F) comes next:
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1
(2 and 3 are the prime factors of 2 and 3. Since 2 is the common prime factor, the prime factor counting is 1.)

(iii) Addition (A) comes before Subtraction (S):
= 6 @ 18 + 11
(12 - 1 = 11)

(iv) Concatenation (C) is last:
= 618 + 11
= 629

So, the answer is 629."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: Given the operation 5+3 # 2.

First, we need to do the Prime Factor Counting (#), which is between 3 and 2. The prime factors of 3 are 3, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Since there is no shared prime factor, 3 # 2 = 0. 

So, the operation now is 5 + 0, and performing this operation gives us the answer as 5.

The answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: The expression given is 5 + 2@4

The steps to solve this, according to the order of operations PEFMDASC, would be:

Step 1: We check for Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting, and Multiplication/Division. None of these are present.

Step 2: Solve Addition: We have the addition operation in our expression. Therefore, we need to perform the addition before we move to the next operation.
So, 5 + 2 = 7. Therefore, the expression becomes 7 @ 4. 

Step 3: Perform Concatenation which is the final operation according to PEFMDASC. This operation combines these numbers as if attaching them one after the other: 
So, 7 @ 4 = 74.

Therefore, the answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: Let's go step by step according to the PEFMDASC order.

Given Expression: 8 # 2+6 # 6. 

First step (Prime Factor Counting (F)):

As per the PEFMDASC, we need to do Prime Factor Counting (F) operations first (if there are no Parentheses (P) or Exponents (E)). So, we'll evaluate 8 # 2 and 6 # 6:

Prime factors of 8 are 2, and prime factors of 2 are also 2. Hence, 8 # 2 is equal to 1 since they share the prime factor 2. 

So now, 8 # 2+6 # 6 becomes 1 + 6 # 6.

Now let's evaluate 6 # 6.
The prime factor of 6 is 2 and 3. Since we are comparing the same numbers, all the prime factors are shared. Hence, 6 # 6 is equal to 2 because 6 has 2 unique prime factors.

Then the expression becomes 1 + 2

Second Step (Addition (A)): 
Following PEFMDASC, we now have an Addition operation. We perform the operation 1 + 2, which equals 3. 

So, finally, we have solved the given expression and its result is 3.

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, we look at the term inside the operation prime factor counting (F). In the expression, the operation is 4#3. 

Prime factors of |4| (4) are 2, and prime factors of |3| (3) are 3. There are no shared prime factors, so 4#3 = 0.

The expression now reads 0 + 2.

According to the order of operations, after the operation F, the next operations are M/D (Multiplication and Division), but there are none. 

Then we look at operations A/S (Addition and Subtraction), and there is one: 0 + 2. This equals 2. 

Since there are no other operations left in the expression, we can conclude:

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: First, according to our new order of operations PEFMDASC, we should compute what is inside the Parentheses:

14 + 4 = 18

So, the expression simplifies to 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3.

Next, in PEFMDASC, 'F' comes before 'A' and 'S'. So, we have to calculate the Prime Factor Counting operation 2#3:

2#3 = 1 (since the prime factors of |2| = {2} and the prime factors of |3| = {3}, they share only 1 common prime factor '2')

So, the expression simplifies to 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1. 

Next, 'A' and 'S' comes before 'C', so we evaluate addition and subtraction from left to right:

18 + 12 = 30 

and 

30 - 1 = 29

Our expression now becomes 6 @ 29.

Lastly, we apply the concatenation operation to get the final answer.

So, 6 @ 29 = 629.

The answer is 629."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: Firstly, we follow the PEFMDASC order, so we need to perform the Prime Factor Counting operation (F) before traditional Addition (A).

Step 1: We calculate 3 # 2. The prime factors of 3 are 3 and prime factors of 2 are 2. There are no common prime factors, so the Prime Factor Counting (F) is 0. So, we get 5 + 0.

Step 2: Now, we can do the addition. Therefore, 5 + 0 equals 5. 

The answer is 5."
