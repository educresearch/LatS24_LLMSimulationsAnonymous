1. Parentheses – There are no parentheses to deal with.
2. Exponents – There are no exponents to deal with.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F) – There is no prime factor counting operation in the expression.
4. Multiplication (M) and Division (D) – There is no multiplication or division to deal with.
5. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S) – We have an addition, but it has to be evaluated after the concatenation since concatenation is the last operation to be performed.
6. Concatenation (C) – We perform the concatenation operation first in this case.

We have the concatenation operation 2 @ 4, which should be done before the addition because concatenation comes last in the order of operations, even after addition.

The concatenation of 2 and 4 would be 24. Now we just need to add 5 to the result.

Performing the remaining operation:
5 + 24 = 29

So the final answer to the expression is 29.

First, let's determine the prime factors of each number:

8 has the prime factor: 2 (2^3)
2 has the prime factor: 2

6 has the prime factors: 2 and 3

Now, we perform the Prime Factor Counting operation (#):

8 # 2 = The count of unique prime factors shared by 8 and 2, which is 1 (since both numbers have the prime factor 2).

6 # 6 = The count of unique prime factors shared by 6 and 6, which is 2 (since the number 6 has the prime factors 2 and 3, and we are comparing it to itself, all prime factors are shared).

Now, add the results of the Prime Factor Counting operations:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3."

Starting with the problem:

4 # 3 + 2

We first look at the prime factor counting operation, which comes before addition according to the new rules.

So we perform the prime factor counting operation (F):

4 # 3

Prime factors of 4: 2, 2 (or just 2, considering unique factors)
Prime factors of 3: 3

As there are no common unique prime factors, the result of the operation is:

0

Now we continue with addition:

0 + 2 = 2

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: Let's solve the given mathematics problem step by step following the new order of operation PEFMDASC.

Given Expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
First, let's evaluate the expression inside the parentheses.

\( 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 \\
= 6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 # 3 \)

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Now we look for any prime factor counting operations to evaluate.

\( 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 \)

The prime factors of 2 are {2} and the prime factors of 3 are {3}. They do not share any prime factors, so:

\( 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 \)

Step 3: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
There is no multiplication or division to evaluate.

Step 4: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
However, to follow the order of operations correctly, we must remember to perform any addition or subtraction before we perform the concatenation operation. Therefore, we do the addition and subtraction next.

\( 6 @ 18 + 12 \\
= 6 @ (18 + 12) \\
= 6 @ 30 \)

Step 5: Concatenation (C)
Finally, we perform the concatenation operation.

\( 6 @ 30 \\
= 630 \)

So the final answer is:

The answer is 630."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we must follow the steps prioritizing prime factor counting before carrying out addition.

Given the expression:
5 + 3 # 2

Step 1: Apply Prime Factor Counting (F) before Addition (A)
- First, we determine the unique prime factors of the numbers 3 and 2.
- The prime factor of 3 is 3 itself.
- The prime factor of 2 is 2 itself.
- There are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2.

So, 3 # 2 = 0

Step 2: Perform the Addition (A)
After evaluating the prime factor counting, we continue with the addition:
5 + (3 # 2)

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: In the given problem, we have an addition and a concatenation operation to perform. According to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC (Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction, Concatenation), we need to perform addition and subtraction before we perform concatenation.

So here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. Perform the addition operation first.
   \(5 + 2 = 7\)

2. Then perform the concatenation operation.
   \(7 @ 4 = 74\)

Concatenation of digits just means placing them next to each other, so \(7 @ 4\) results in \(74\). There are no parentheses or other higher-priority operations to consider.

Therefore, the final answer to the problem is 74.

- To find the shared unique prime factors of 8 and 2: 
  8's prime factors are 2, 2, and 2 (which is 2 cubed), 
  2 is a prime number and its only prime factor is itself.
  They share a single unique prime factor: 2.
  So, 8 # 2 = 1.

- To find the shared unique prime factors of 6 and 6:
  6's prime factors are 2 and 3.
  6's prime factors are the same for both numbers since they're the same number.
  There are 2 unique prime factors that they share: 2 and 3.
  So, 6 # 6 = 2.

Now the expression becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we handle prime factor counting (F):
2 # 3 = 0 because there are no common prime factors between 2 and 3.

The expression now becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Next, we handle addition and subtraction (left to right):
18 + 12 = 30

The expression now becomes:
6 @ 30 - 0

Since subtraction is next in the order (left to right) and we're subtracting zero, it will not change the result:

The operation # denotes Prime Factor Counting and takes priority over addition according to the new order of operations.

Given problem:
8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Step 1: Evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F):
8 # 2:
The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (since 8 = 2^3). The prime factors of 2 are obviously just 2. So they have one unique common prime factor, which is 2.

6 # 6:
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since we're comparing the same number (6 # 6), it clearly has the common unique prime factors: 2 and 3.

So, we have 8 # 2 = 1 and 6 # 6 = 2 (because they have two common unique prime factors, 2 and 3).

Step 2: Perform the addition using the results from step 1:
1 (from 8 # 2) + 2 (from 6 # 6) = 3

Prime factors of 3 are just 3.
There are no common prime factors between 4 and 3, so 4 # 3 = 0.

   So the expression becomes:
   6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Exponents (E)
   There are no exponents to calculate in this expression.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
   Next, we find the shared unique prime factors of 2 and 3:
   Prime factors of 2: 2
   Prime factors of 3: 3

Let's do this step by step:

1. Evaluate \(8 \# 2\):
   The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or \(2^3\)). 
   The prime factor of 2 is 2.
   The shared prime factor is 2.
   Therefore, the count of unique shared prime factors is 1.

   So, \(8 \# 2\) becomes \(1\).

2. Evaluate \(6 \# 6\):
   The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
   Since they are the same number, the shared unique prime factors are also 2 and 3.
   However, we are counting unique prime factors, so the number of shared unique prime factors is 2.

   So, \(6 \# 6\) becomes \(2\).

3. Add the results of the prime factor counting:
   According to the new operation of prime factor counting, we will add \(1\) to \(2\), which gives us:

   \(1 + 2 = 3\).

Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Parentheses (P):** 
   First, we solve the expression inside the parentheses.
   \( (14 + 4) = 18 \)

2. **No Exponents (E) present,** so we can move to the next step.

3. **Prime Factor Counting (F):**
   Since we do not have a prime factor within parentheses or multiplication/division to work through yet, we will apply the prime factor counting next:
   \( 2 # 3 \)
   The prime factors of 2 are just 2, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3. There are no shared prime factors, so:
   \( 2 # 3 = 0 \)

4. **No Multiplication/Division (M/D) at this stage,** so we move to the next operations.

5. **Addition/Subtraction (A/S):**
   We can add and subtract in the order they appear from left to right but after we have handled the prime factor counting.
   The only subtraction operation we have is affected by the prime factor counting result.

   Concatenation joins the numbers together:
