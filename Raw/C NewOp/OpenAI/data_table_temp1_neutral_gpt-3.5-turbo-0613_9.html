In this case, we have 3 and 2, so we need to find the unique prime factors they have in common. The prime factors of 3 are 3, and the prime factors of 2 are 2.

The absolute values of 5 and 3 are both 5 and 3 respectively. So, we need to find the count of unique prime factors shared between 5 and 3.
