Prime Factor counting (F): The first step is to count the number of shared unique prime factors for each pair of numbers in the prime factor counting operation (#).\n\n- For 8#2:\nThe absolute values are 8 and 2, and their prime factors are:\n8 = 2^3 (prime factors: 2)\n2 = 2 (prime factors: 2)\nThey share the prime factor 2, so 8#2 = 1 (since there is only one shared prime factor).\n\n- For 6#6:\nThe absolute values are 6 and 6, and their prime factors are:\n6 = 2 * 3 (prime factors: 2, 3)\nSince they are both 6, they share the same prime factors. Thus, there are two unique prime factors in common (2 and 3), so 6#6 = 2.\n\n2. Addition (A): Next, we perform the addition operation with the results of the prime factor counting.\n\nSo, (8#2) + (6#6) = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nThe final answer after performing the operations according to the updated order of operations is:\n\nThe answer is 3."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt2_userPrompt3_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400", "model": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 400, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "Introduction of New Mathematical Operations and Updated Order of Operations\n                    Mathematics has recently introduced two novel operations:\n\n                    Concatenation (C): This operation, denoted as a @ b, represents the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. \n                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):\n                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.\n                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.\n                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.\n                    \n                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Represented as a # b, this operation counts the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of a and b. \n                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):\n                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1\n                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) \n                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. \n                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)\n                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. \n                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)\n                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.\n                    \n                    The order of operations has been revised to PEFMDASC, representing:\n\n                    P: Parentheses\n                    E: Exponents\n                    F: Prime Factor counting\n                    M/D: Multiplication and Division (left to right)\n                    A/S: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)\n                    C: Concatenation (left to right)\n                    \n                    Important Examples Demonstrating New Operations and Order:\n                    (i) 5 @ 3 + 6\n                    = 5 @ 9 (since we need to evaluate addition before concatenation)\n                    = 59\n\n                    (ii) 5 # 3 + 6\n                    = 0 + 6 (since we need to evaluate prime factorization before addition)\n                    = 6\n\n                    (iii) 5 - 3 @ 6\n                    = 2 @ 6 (since we need to evaluate subtraction before concatenation)\n                    = 26\n\n                    (iv) 5 - 3 # 6\n                    = 5 - 1 (since we need to evaluate prime factorization before subtraction)\n                    = 4\n\n                    (vi) (3 + 10 # 2) * 5 @ 42 \n                    = (3 + 1) * 5 @ 42 (we need to evaluate what is in the parenthesis first and prime factor counting is before addition)\n                    = 4 * 5 @ 42  (we need to evaluate multiplication before concatenation\n                    = 20 @ 42 = 2042.
