gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the problem with the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to follow this sequence. Since there are no parentheses, exponents, factor counting, multiplication, division, addition, or subtraction that would be affected by the order, we can move directly to the last operation.

However, according to the convention, we must perform addition before the concatenation operation. Therefore, we evaluate the addition first and then apply the concatenation.

The mathematics problem is:

5 + 2 @ 4

First, perform the addition (5 + 2):

5 + 2 = 7

Next, apply concatenation with 7 and 4:

7 @ 4 = 74

Hence, following the correct order of operations PEFMDASC results in the final answer.

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem, we need to apply the new operations and the updated order of operations, PEFMDASC. Let's break down the expression step by step:

The expression given is 8 # 2 + 6 # 6.

Firstly, we need to determine the prime factors of the numbers involved:
- The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or just 2 considering unique factors).
- The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
- The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.

Next, according to the rules for the operation ""#"", we need to count the unique prime factors shared by each pair of numbers.

Let's perform the prime factor counting operation '#':
- 8 # 2: Since both numbers share the prime factor 2, the result of this operation is 1 (there is only one unique prime factor shared, which is 2).
- 6 # 6: Since the number is compared with itself, all its prime factors are shared; however, we count unique prime factors, and since 6 has unique prime factors 2 and 3, we consider those and get a count of 2.

Next, we have the addition ""+"" due to the following operation order 'PEFMDASC':
- 1 (from 8 # 2) + 2 (from 6 # 6)

Now we perform the addition:
- 1 + 2 = 3

The final answer is the result of the addition, so:

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem 4 # 3 + 2 using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we must first evaluate the Prime Factor counting (F) before performing the addition (A).

For the operation 4 # 3, we look for the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 4 and 3.

- The prime factors of 4 are 2 (4 = 2^2).
- The prime factors of 3 are 3 (3 = 3^1).

Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, the result of 4 # 3 is 0.

Now we add the result to 2.

So, 4 # 3 + 2 becomes 0 + 2.

Performing the addition, we get 2.

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: Let's solve the given problem step by step according to the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Prime Factor counting
4. Multiplication and Division (Left to Right)
5. Addition and Subtraction (Left to Right)
6. Concatenation (Left to Right)

Given Problem: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses (resolve the expression within parentheses first)
6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: There are no exponents to resolve.

Step 3: Prime Factor counting operation
First, we figure out the prime factors:
- The prime factors of 2 are 2.
- The prime factors of 3 are 3.

There are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3, so:
6 @ 18 + 12 - (0) => since 2 # 3 is 0

Step 4: There are no multiplication and divisions to perform.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (perform these operations from left to right)
6 @ 18 + 12 => since there's no need for subtraction now
Add 12 to 18:
6 @ (18 + 12) = 6 @ 30

Step 6: Concatenation (left to right)
Lastly, we perform the concatenation of 6 and 30:
6 @ 30 = 630

There are no remaining operations, so the final answer is:
The answer is 630."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve the problem with the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we start by evaluating the prime factor counting operation before the addition.

5 + 3 # 2

Since prime factor counting (F) comes before addition (A), we need to first compute 3 # 2. The prime factors of 3 are just 3 itself, and the prime factors of 2 are just 2 itself. There are no shared prime factors, so the result is 0.

3 # 2 = 0

Now we substitute this back into the original expression:

5 + 0

Next, we perform the addition:

5 + 0 = 5

So the final answer is:

The answer is 5."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem using the updated order of operations, we need to follow the PEFMDASC sequence.

Here is the problem:
5 + 2 @ 4

Step 1: Prime Factor counting (F) - There are no operations that involve prime factor counting in this expression.

Step 2: Multiplication and Division (M/D) - There are no multiplication or division operations in this expression.

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction (A/S) - As per the updated order of operations, we must evaluate addition before concatenation.

Step 4: Concatenation (C) - We have the ""+"" operation and the ""@"" operation, and addition must occur before concatenation.

Evaluation:
5 + 2 @ 4
= 7 @ 4 (performing the addition first)
= 74 (performing the concatenation operation, which merges the digits of 7 and 4 into one number)

Therefore, the final answer is 74.

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: Let's evaluate the given expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

Prime Factor Counting (F):
Firstly, we evaluate the prime factors of each number and perform the prime factor counting (F) operation for both 8 # 2 and 6 # 6.

8 # 2:
The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or 2^3), while the prime factors of 2 are simply 2. The number of unique shared prime factors is 1, because both have the prime factor of 2.

6 # 6:
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since both numbers are the same, the shared prime factors are the same as the prime factors of 6, which are 2 and 3. However, since the operation counts unique prime factors, even though the factors are repeated, the count is 2 (for the two unique prime factors).

Now, we replace the prime factor counting results in our original expression:
8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 2.

Addition (A):
Finally, we add the two results:
1 + 2 = 3.

So, after performing all the necessary operations, the final answer is 3.

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem, we first apply the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation before performing addition, according to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC.

Let's evaluate 4 # 3 first.

4 has the prime factors 2 and 2 (2^2).
3 has the prime factor 3.

Since 4 and 3 do not share any prime factors, the result of 4 # 3 is 0.

Now we can perform the addition:

0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: Let's evaluate the expression 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 using the newly updated order of operations PEFMDASC.

First, we need to perform the operations within the Parentheses:
(14 + 4) = 18

Next, we deal with Exponents, but there are none in this expression.

Then, we look for Prime factor counting (F):
2 # 3 = 1 (since 2 and 3 share no prime factors)

Now, we proceed with Multiplication and Division, but again, none are present.

We then carry out Addition and Subtraction:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (Resolve the addition and subtraction from left to right)
6 @ 18 + 12 = 6 @ 30 (since 18 + 12 = 30)
6 @ 30 - 1 = 630 - 1 (Concatenation takes place before we subtract)
630 - 1 = 629

Finally, we handle Concatenation (C), which has already been addressed within the steps above.

As a result, our final answer after evaluating the expression is 629.

The answer is 629."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve the expression using the newly updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we start by identifying any prime factor counting (F) since there are no parentheses, exponents, or multiplication/division to consider first.

The expression is:

5 + 3 # 2

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
We count the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 3 and 2.

The prime factors of 3 are just 3, and the prime factors of 2 are just 2. Since they share no common prime factors, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 0.

3 # 2 = 0

Step 2: Addition (A)
Now we perform the addition operation.

5 + (3 # 2) 
= 5 + 0 
= 5

Since there are no more operations to perform, our final answer is 5. So, the expression ""5 + 3 # 2"" evaluates to 5.

The answer is 5."

3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
4. Multiplication (M) and Division (D) (left to right)
5. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S) (left to right)
6. Concatenation (C) (left to right)

In the problem 5 + 2 @ 4, we only have addition and concatenation to consider.

Following the order of operations, we perform addition before concatenation:

5 + 2 = 7

Now we have:

7 @ 4

Next, we perform the concatenation:

7 @ 4 = 74 (this operation merges the digits 7 and 4)

Therefore, the final answer is 74.

8 # 2 + 6 # 6

First, we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F):

The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2.
The prime factors of 2 are just 2.

Since they share a prime factor, the operation 8 # 2 results in the count of shared unique prime factors:

8 # 2 = 1 (because 2 is the unique shared prime factor)

Next, we evaluate 6 # 6:

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
The prime factors of 6 are the same, 2 and 3.

Both numbers share the prime factors 2 and 3, but since we are counting unique prime factors, the count will be:

6 # 6 = 2 (because 2 and 3 are the unique shared prime factors)

Now, we add the results of the prime factor counting operations:

1 + 2 = 3

Therefore, the entire operation evaluates to:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3."

4 # 3 + 2

First, we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) before addition (A):
- The prime factorization of 4 is 2 and 2.
- The prime factorization of 3 is 3.

Since 4 and 3 have no shared prime factors, 4 # 3 equals 0.

Consequently, the equation becomes:
0 + 2

Next, we perform the addition:
0 + 2 = 2

Therefore, the final answer is 2.

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

We start with what's inside the parentheses (P):

So now, the expression becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we deal with Prime Factor Counting (F):
The prime factors of |2| are {2}, and the prime factors of |3| are {3}. They share no common prime factors.
2 # 3 = 0
The expression now becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Now we can go to Addition and Subtraction (A/S), as there are no Exponentiations (E), Multiplication (M), or Division (D) operations:
6 @ 18 is not evaluated yet since Concatenation (C) is the last operation
12 - 0 = 12

So we are left with:
6 @ 18 + 12
Now we perform Concatenation (C):
6 @ 18 = 618

The given problem is 5 + 3 # 2. Following the order of operations, we must execute the prime factor counting (F) first.

Prime Factor Counting for 3 # 2:
- The prime factors of 3 are just 3 because it is a prime number.
- The prime factors of 2 are just 2 because it is also a prime number.
- There are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2.

Since our expression is 5 + 2 @ 4, we first have to consider addition and concatenation. According to the PEFMDASC order, concatenation comes after addition. Therefore:

Step 1: Evaluate 2 @ 4
Concatenation joins the digits of 2 and 4 together:
2 @ 4 = 24

Step 2: Add 5 to the result of the concatenation

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: Let's solve the given expression step by step according to the updated order of operations, PEFMDASC.

1. Prime Factor Counting (F)

First, we evaluate the prime factor counting between 8 and 2:

Prime factors of 8: 2, 2, 2 (which are all 2)
Prime factors of 2: 2

There is one unique shared prime factor between 8 and 2, which is 2.

So, 8 # 2 becomes 1.

Next, we evaluate the prime factor counting between 6 and 6:

Prime factors of 6: 2, 3
Prime factors of 6: 2, 3

There are two unique shared prime factors between 6 and 6, which are 2 and 3.

So, 6 # 6 becomes 2.

2. Addition (A)

Now, we simply add the results together:

1 (from 8 # 2) + 2 (from 6 # 6)

1 + 2 = 3

According to the updated order of operations, concatenation (C) does not apply, as there are no concatenation operations in the given expression.

   - Prime factors of 4 are: 2, 2 (2 is the only prime number in its factorization).
   - Prime factors of 3 are: 3.
   There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3.

The given expression is:
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
We start with the expression inside the parentheses:
14 + 4 = 18

Now our expression becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents in our expression, so we can move on to the next step.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
We have 2 # 3, which counts unique prime factors shared between 2 and 3:
Since 2 is the only prime factor of 2, and 3 is the only prime factor of 3, they have no shared prime factors.
2 # 3 = 0

Our expression is now:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication/Division (M/D)
There is no multiplication or division to perform next.

Step 5: Addition/Subtraction (A/S)
Proceed with the addition and the subtraction in the expression from left to right:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0
= (6 @ 18) + (12 - 0) (We should perform addition and subtraction in the sequence they appear from left to right, but `@` is after addition. Therefore, 6 should be concatenated with 18 before adding 12.)

Let's do a part of the subtraction which is straightforward:
12 - 0 = 12

Our expression is now:
6 @ 18 + 12

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
Now we will perform the concatenation:
6 @ 18 = 618

Our expression now looks like:
618 + 12

- The prime factors of 3 are simply 3, as it is a prime number itself.
- The prime factors of 2 are 2, since it is also a prime number.
- They share no common prime factors, thus the number of unique shared prime factors is 0.
