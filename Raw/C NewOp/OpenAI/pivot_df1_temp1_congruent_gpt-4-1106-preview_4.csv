gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem 5 + 2 @ 4, we need to follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC (Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right, and finally, Concatenation from left to right).

Let's apply these rules step by step:

1. There are no parentheses, exponents, or prime factor counting operations to perform first.
2. There is no multiplication, division, addition, or subtraction inside a parenthesis to perform before concatenation.
3. We perform the addition (A) before concatenation (C) because addition now comes before concatenation in the order of operations.

Starting with the addition:
5 + 2 = 7

Then, we perform the concatenation:
7 @ 4 = 74

Thus, the final answer is:

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: Let's evaluate the given Mathematics problem according to the PEFMDASC order of operations:

8#2 + 6#6 

PEFMDASC dictates that we perform Prime Factor Counting (F) before doing Addition (A).

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): 
8 has prime factors of 2 (2 x 2 x 2), 
2 is a prime number, therefore, it has only one prime factor - itself, so the shared prime factor is 2.
8#2 = 1

6 has prime factors of 2 and 3,
6 also has the prime factors of 2 and 3.
Since they share two prime factors, 2 and 3,
6#6 = 2

2. Addition (A): 
Now we add the results of the prime factor counting operations together.
1 + 2 = 3

The final answer to this problem is:
The answer is 3."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem ""4 # 3 + 2"" following the new order of operations PEFMDASC, here are the steps:

1. Evaluate any prime factor counting (F) before addition (A), according to the order of operations.
2. Since there are no parentheses (P), exponents (E), multiplication (M), division (D), subtraction (S), or concatenation (C), we proceed with the prime factor counting first.

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
\[ 4 # 3 = |\text{Prime factors of } 4| # |\text{Prime factors of } 3| \]

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (i.e., 2 squared).
The prime factors of 3 are just 3 itself.
There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so:

\[ 4 # 3 = 0 \]

Step 2: Addition (A)
\[ 0 + 2 = 2 \]

Therefore, after evaluating the operations according to the order of operations, the final answer is:

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: Let's follow the PEFMDASC order of operations to solve the given Mathematics problem:

Given Expression: 6@(14+4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses
First, we need to deal with what's inside the parentheses (14+4):
6@(14+4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6@(18) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents
There are no exponents to deal with in this expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor counting (F)
Now we calculate the prime factor counting operation for -2 # 3:
Since 2 has the prime factors of 2 and 3 has the prime factors of 3, they do not share any common prime factors.

6@(18) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6@(18) + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (MD)
There are no multiplication or division operations to perform.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (AS)
Next, we perform the addition and subtraction:
6@(18) + 12 - 0
= 6@(18) + 12

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
Finally, we perform the concatenation operation. Concatenation of 6 and 18:
6 @ 18 = 618

Completing the addition:
618 + 12
= 630

Now all operations have been performed.

The answer is 630."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we need to follow the order of operations PEFMDASC (Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction, Concatenation).

Given the problem:
5 + 3#2

According to the order of operations, we must evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operation before we do the Addition.

Prime Factor Counting (F) (3#2):
- Since the prime factors of 3 are just 3,
- And the prime factors of 2 are just 2,
- There are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, so 3#2 evaluates to 0.

The expression is 5 + 2 @ 4.

1. Concatenation (C) is the last operation in the list, so we will first perform the concatenation of 2 and 4, given by the operation 2 @ 4.
   Since 2 @ 4 is a concatenation of the numbers 2 and 4, it results in 24.

2. Now, we have the expression 5 + 24 after performing the concatenation.

3. Finally, we perform the addition (A) which is before Concatenation (C) in the order of operations.
   So, 5 + 24 will be evaluated as 29.

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: For this mathematics problem, we'll apply the operations according to the revised order of operations PEFMDASC.

Given the problem: 8#2 + 6#6

First, evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F):
1. 8 and 2 share the prime factor 2, so 8#2 is 1 (since the prime factors of 8 are 2 x 2 x 2 and the prime factors of 2 is just 2).
2. The number 6 has prime factors 2 and 3. Since it is compared with itself, it naturally shares all its prime factors, so there are two unique prime factors, but # is for shared unique factors, so 6#6 is 2.

Now, with the prime factor counting done, we have:
1 + 2

Finally, Addition (A):
1 + 2 = 3

2. Addition (A) comes after prime factor counting:
   0 + 2 = 2

With prime factor counting computed first, followed by the addition, we arrive at the final result. There is no need for parentheses, exponents, multiplication/division, subtraction, or concatenation in this problem.

Given expression: 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3

1. Parentheses (P)
First, we solve the operation inside the parentheses.
(14 + 4) = 18

So the expression becomes:
6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Exponents (E)
There are no exponents to deal with in this problem.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation:
2 # 3 = 0 (since 2 and 3 do not share any prime factors)

The expression now is:
6@18 + 12 - 0

4. Multiplication / Division (M/D)
There are no multiplication or division operations to perform here.

5. Addition / Subtraction (A/S)
The updated order of operations tells us that addition and subtraction are performed from left to right, and we no longer need to consider these separately. However, we must still wait to perform concatenation until the end.
So we do the addition and subtraction next.

12 - 0 = 12

The expression becomes:
6@18 + 12

6. Concatenation (C)
Finally, we perform the concatenation operation from left to right. Concatenation is done after all addition and subtraction.

6@18 = 618

Now adding 12:
618 + 12 = 630

The only prime factor of 3 is 3, and the only prime factor of 2 is 2. Since there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, the result of this operation is 0.

2. Now let's perform the addition:

5 + (3 # 2) = 5 + 0 = 5

Based on these operations, the final answer is 5.

The problem: 5 + 2 @ 4

Step 1: According to the order, we must perform Prime Factor Counting (F) first. However, there is no prime factor operation here. So we move to the next step.

Step 2: We do addition or subtraction before we get to concatenation (C), because according to the list, Addition and Subtraction (A/S) come before Concatenation (C).

Therefore, we will perform the addition first:
5 + 2 = 7

Step 3: Now we have 7 @ 4. The concatenation operation will combine the digits of 7 and 4.

7 @ 4 = 74

1. Prime Factor Counting (F)
2. Addition (A)

Now, let's apply these operations to the problem:

\(8 # 2 + 6 # 6\)

First, we evaluate the prime factor counting operations:

- Since the prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2, and the prime factors of 2 are just 2, there is 1 unique shared prime factor which is 2.
- Since the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and we are looking for the count of common prime factors in 6 and 6 itself, the count would be 2 (for both prime factors 2 and 3).

Next, we will apply the addition operation:

We start by evaluating the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation, which comes before addition.

4 and 3 have no common prime factors. The prime factor for 4 is 2, and for 3 is 3. There are no common prime factors between 4 and 3, so:

4 # 3 = 0

6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3

First, we evaluate what's in the parenthesis (P):
6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3
6@18 + 12-2 # 3

Now we deal with exponents (E), but there are none to consider in this problem.

Next is prime factor counting (F):
6@18 + 12-2 # 3
= 6@18 + 12-1
= 6@18 + 11 (since the prime factors of 2 are 2 and prime factors of 3 are 3; they share no common prime factors.)

Following this, we look at multiplication and division (M/D), which we do not have here.

We then perform addition and subtraction (A/S) from left to right:
6@18 + 11
= 6@29 (since we need to evaluate addition before concatenation)
Finally, we perform concatenation (C):

Given the problem: 5 + 2 @ 4

1. There are no Parentheses, Exponents, or Prime Factor counting to consider.
2. There's also no Multiplication or Division necessary.
3. The next step is to look for Addition or Subtraction. We have an addition here: 5 + (2 @ 4)
4. But according to the PEFMDASC rule, we must perform Concatenation before the Addition.
5. Thus, we will perform the Concatenation operation first: 2 @ 4
6. Concatenation simply joins the digits of 2 and 4 together, so 2 @ 4 becomes 24.
7. Now, we go back to the Addition operation: 5 + 24

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: Let's evaluate the given expression 8#2 + 6#6 step by step following the PEFMDASC order of operations. The two operations to evaluate are both Prime Factor Counting (F).

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F) – Evaluate 8#2
- Prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or \(2^3\)).
- Prime factors of 2 are just 2.
- They share a common prime factor, which is 2.
- Since there is only one unique prime factor shared between them, the result of 8#2 is 1.

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F) – Evaluate 6#6
- Prime factors of the first 6 are 2 and 3.
- Prime factors of the second 6 are also 2 and 3.
- They share the prime factors 2 and 3.
- However, since we are counting unique shared prime factors, it doesn't matter how many times a prime factor is repeated.
- The result is 2 because there are two unique prime factors shared (2 and 3).

Step 3: Addition (A) – Add the results of Step 1 and Step 2
- We add the result of 8#2, which is 1, with the result of 6#6, which is 2.
- 1 + 2 = 3

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step, using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
- According to the definition of Prime Factor Counting, we're looking for the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 4 and 3.
- The prime factorization of 4 is 2 * 2 (which is just the prime number 2).
- The prime factorization of 3 is just 3.
- Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, the result of this operation is 0.

So, 4 # 3 = 0

Step 2: Addition (A)
- Now we can add the result from step 1 to the next number in the expression.
- 0 (from 4 # 3) + 2

Now our expression looks like:
6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents to evaluate in this expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation.
Since 2 # 3 is checking for shared prime factors between 2 and 3, and they have no shared prime factors, it evaluates to:
2 # 3 = 0 

Our expression is now:
6@18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication/Division (M/D)
There are no multiplication or division operations to perform.

Step 5: Addition (A) and Subtraction (S)
We perform addition and subtraction from left to right.
First, we need to continue with the expression without performing the addition or subtraction because there's a concatenation operation after the addition that needs to be addressed first.

Our expression remains:
6@18 + 12 - 0

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
Concatenation is performed before addition and subtraction according to the new order, so we execute it next.
6 @ 18 = 618

Now our expression becomes:
618 + 12 - 0

Step 7: Addition/Subtraction (A/S)
Now we can perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.
First, add:
