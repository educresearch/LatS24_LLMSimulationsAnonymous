gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: In order to solve this problem, we will have to apply the newly defined operations and order of operations, PEFMDASC.

Problem: 5 + 2 @ 4 

Here, we have one operation which is addition (+), and another which is concatenation (@). According to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), addition (+) should be evaluated before concatenation (@). 

So, we first add: 5 + 2 = 7. Now, we substitute this in the original equation.

Let's simplify: 7 @ 4 

The @ operation concatenates the numbers as per the rules. Therefore, 7 @ 4 becomes 74. 

So, the answer to the problem 5 + 2 @ 4 as per the new order of operations and rules will be 74.

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: First we have to define the prime factors for numbers 8, 2, and 6. 

We know that:
- Prime factors of 8 are 2.
- Prime factors of 2 are 2.
- Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.

Now, using the Prime Factor Counting operation (F), we have to find shared prime factors:

For 8 # 2, the shared prime factor is 2. So, 8 # 2 = 1.

Similarly, for 6 # 6, as they are the same number their shared prime factors will also be the same (both 2 and 3 are shared prime factors). So, 6 # 6 = 2.

Now substituting back to the given expression, we will have:
8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 2.

According to the order of operations (PEFMDASC), we will perform the addition operation to get:
8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 2 = 3.

So, the answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: In order to solve this problem, we will have to apply the new operations as defined above following the sequence laid out by PEFMDASC.

Here is the solution:

Step 1: Evaluate F - Prime factor counting
We have to find the number of common prime factors of 4 and 3. The prime factors of 4 are 2, and prime factor of 3 is 3. As such, they have no common prime factor(s).

So, 4 # 3 = 0.

Thus, the expression becomes: 0 + 2

Step 2: Evaluate A - Addition
Now, we simply add the two numbers. 

So, the final answer is: 0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: First apply the parenthesis, as the order of operations ""PEFMDASC"" suggests:
6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 # 3

Then the concatenation operation comes after parentheses, so let's do the concatenation:
618 + 12 - 2 # 3

Now we move to the next operation according to the order which is 'F' - prime factor counting:
618 + 12 - 1 (since the prime factors of 2 and 3 are 2 and 3, only 1 shared, so 2#3 = 1)

Next, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right:
630 - 1

Finally, we get:
The answer is 629."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: In order to solve this problem, we will have to apply the new operations as defined above following the sequence laid out in PEFMDASC.

Here is the solution:

Step 1: Evaluate F - Prime factor counting
3 # 2
Prime factors of 3: 3
Prime factors of 2: 2
Since 3 and 2 have no common prime factors, 3 # 2 = 0.

Therefore, 5 + 3 # 2 becomes:
5 + 0.

Step 2: Evaluate A - Addition
5 + 0 = 5.

Hence, the answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Given the expression is 5 + 2 @ 4, considering the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to perform addition before concatenation.

Firstly, we calculate 8 # 2 and 6 # 6:
8 # 2 = 1 (since both 8 and 2 have the same prime factor of 2)
6 # 6 = 1 (since both numbers are the same, they share the same prime factors which are 2 and 3)

Then we substitute into the expression:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 1 = 2.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we must follow the order of operations. The updated order of operations prioritized as Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction, and Concatenation.

An initial glance at the problem shows it contains parentheses, prime factor counting, addition, subtraction, and concatenation. Let's break down the steps:

Initial Mathematical Problem: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1 - Parentheses (P):
Inside the parentheses, we have 14 + 4, which equals 18.
So our equation now is: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2 - Prime Factor Counting (F):
Next operation to handle is Prime Factor Counting, denoted by #. To simplify 2 # 3, we're checking for common prime factors. The prime factor of 2 is 2, and the prime factor of 3 is 3, so they have no prime factors in common. This equals 0.
So our equation now is: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3 - Addition and Subtraction (A/S):
Within this step, we perform the operations from left to right. First, we address the addition, 18 + 12 = 30. After this, we address subtraction, 30 - 0 = 30.
So our equation now is: 6 @ 30

Step 4 - Concatenation (C):
Finally, we'll use the Concatenation operation. Concatenation joins the digits together, in this case, 6 and 30 become 630.

Hence, based on the newly updated order of operations: 

The answer is 630."

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: Given the expression: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6, let's solve this using the Revised Order of Operations (PEFMDASC).

According to PEFMDASC, we have to first take care of Prime Factor counting (F) which comes before addition (A). 

Let's begin with prime factor counting:

(a) 8 # 2: 
Here we are looking for shared prime factors of numbers 8 and 2. 
The prime factors of 8 are 2 (2 * 2 * 2), and for 2, it's just 2.
The shared prime factor here is 2. Therefore, 8 # 2 equals 1.

(b) 6 # 6: 
Normally, a number will share all its prime factors with itself. 
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. So, 6 # 6 is equals to 2 (as there are two unique prime factors).

Now we substitute these back into the expression: 1 (from 8 # 2) + 2 (from 6 # 6).

Following the order, the next operation is addition. So, we add these two values: 1 + 2 = 3.

The final result is 3.

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: Using the new operation Prime Factor Counting (F), denoted as '#', and the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), the following problem 4 # 3 + 2 can be solved step by step.

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
The expression 4 # 3 is calculated first according to the updated order of operations. Here, '#' represents prime factor counting (F).

A number's prime factors are the list of prime numbers that divide it exactly. 
The prime factor of 4 is 2.
The prime factor of 3 is 3.
Here, there are no shared prime factors for 4 and 3.

So, 4 # 3 equals 0.

Step 2: Addition (A)
The remaining operation to perform is addition (+). Now we have:

0 + 2 equals 2.

So, following the order PEFMDASC, the expression 4 # 3 + 2 evaluates to 2.

The answer is 2."

= 6 @ 18 + 12
= 6 @ 30
