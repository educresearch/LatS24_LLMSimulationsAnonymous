gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression, we must follow the revised order of operations: PEFMDASC.

This means we start with the parentheses, but since there are no parentheses in the given expression, we move on to the next step.

Next, we evaluate the exponentiation, but there are no exponents in the given expression.

Following that, we move to prime factor counting (F), but again, this operation does not apply here.

After that, we perform multiplication or division from left to right. However, there are no multiplication or division operations in the given expression.

Then, we proceed with addition or subtraction from left to right, where we do have an addition operation: 5 + 2.

Finally, according to the revised order of operations, the very last operation to perform would be concatenation (C). Hence, following the calculation of the addition, we perform the concatenation operation of the result with 4.

Therefore, by following the revised order of operations, the given expression 5 + 2 @ 4 translates to 7 @ 4, and it results in 74.
