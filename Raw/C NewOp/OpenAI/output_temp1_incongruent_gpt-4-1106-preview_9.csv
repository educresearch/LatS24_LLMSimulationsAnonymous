Given Expression: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): We start by evaluating the prime factor counting operations. Since 8 has prime factors 2 (2 x 2 x 2) and 2 is itself a prime, 8 # 2 results in a count of 1 shared prime factor (2). Similarly, 6 has prime factors 2 and 3, both of which do not match with itself being the prime factor counting with itself, so 6 # 6 results in a count of 0 shared prime factors.

So, 8 # 2 = 1
And 6 # 6 = 0

2. Addition (A): Next, we add the results from the prime factor counting operations.

The expression now becomes: 1 + 0

Simply adding those together: 1 + 0 = 1

There are no other operations to perform. Therefore, the final answer to the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 is 1.

systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Let's break down the given mathematics problem step by step using the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Parentheses (P)
2. Exponents (E)
3. Prime Factor counting (F)
4. Multiplication (M) and Division (D) (left to right)
5. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S) (left to right)
6. Concatenation (C) (left to right)

We have: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

Step 1: Parentheses
First, we will evaluate the expression within the parentheses (14+4):
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: There are no exponents in the expression, so we move on to the next operation.

Step 3: Prime Factor counting
Next, we calculate the prime factor counting of 2#3:
The prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. They do not share any common prime factors, so:
2#3 = 0

Now we have:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: There are no Multiplication and Division operations to perform, so we move on.

Step 5: Perform Addition and Subtraction
Prior to performing concatenation, we must perform the addition and subtraction:
18 + 12 - 0 = 30

Now the expression is:
6 @ 30

Step 6: Concatenation
Finally, we perform the Concatenation operation:
6 @ 30 = 630

The answer is 630."

                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e.,

                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

8 and 2 share the prime factor 2, so there's 1 unique prime factor shared between 8 and 2.

Next,

The problem given is:  6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

First, we handle the parentheses (P):
6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 # 3

Then, we proceed with the Prime Factor Counting (F):
To find 2 # 3, we need to identify the prime factors of 2 and 3.
- 2 has the prime factor of 2.
- 3 has the prime factor of 3.
Since there are no shared prime factors, 2 # 3 = 0.

So the equation becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

We then proceed with Multiplication/Division (M/D), but since there is none, we move to Addition/Subtraction (A/S):

6 @ 18 + 12

Since we have no additions or subtractions to perform before the concatenation (C), we proceed with the concatenation:
6 @ 18 = 618

Now our equation is:
618 + 12

We perform the addition:
618 + 12 = 630

Therefore, the final answer is:

2. Exponents: There are none.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): Not applicable here since there is no # operator in the expression.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): Not applicable here since there are no multiplication or division symbols in the expression.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): There is addition, but it should be done after concatenation (C) according to the new rules.
6. Concatenation (C): We have to evaluate the concatenation first. So we evaluate 2@4.

2@4 = |2|@|4| = 24 (since concatenation merges the digits)

7. Now we perform addition:

5 + 24 = 29

The answer is 29."

8 # 2 + 6 # 6

First, we look for parentheses and exponents, of which there are none.
Then, we apply the Prime Factor Counting operation (F):

8 # 2

The unique prime factors of 8 are 2 (since 8 = 2^3), and the unique prime factors of 2 is obviously 2. Since 2 is a common prime factor, we have:

8 # 2 = 1

Then, we calculate the next Prime Factor Counting operation:

6 # 6

The unique prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since both numbers are the same, the unique prime factors are indeed 2 and 3, so:

6 # 6 = 2 (since there are two shared prime factors: 2 and 3)

Now we have:

1 + 2

Now, we do the addition:

1 + 2 = 3

So, the final answer to the expression is 3.

Starting with parentheses (P):

6 @ (18) + 12 - 2#3

Next is exponents (E), but there are no exponents in this problem, so we move on to prime factor counting (F):

2#3 is the number of unique prime factors common to 2 and 3. Since 2's prime factors are just 2 and 3's prime factors are just 3, there are no prime factors in common, so:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

We then proceed with multiplication/division (M/D), but there are none present in this expression. Then we do addition/subtraction (A/S):

6 @ 18 + 12
= 6 @ (18 + 12)
= 6 @ 30
= 630 (Concatenating 6 and 30)

The subtraction part now is 630 - 0, which is just 630. Concatenation (C) is already applied where needed.

Therefore, the final answer is 630.

8 # 2:
- The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (2^3).

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
   First, we calculate the prime factor counting 4#3. 
   The prime factors of 4 are 2 (since 4 = 2^2), and the prime factors of 3 are 3 since 3 is a prime number itself. 
   These do not share any common prime factors, so:
   4#3 = 0

2. Addition (A):
   Now, we add the result from step 1 to 2:
   0 + 2 = 2

There are no other operations to perform. Therefore, the final answer to the expression 4#3 + 2 is:

The answer is 2."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)

2. Prime Factor Counting (F):

4. Addition and Subtraction (A/S):
   With concatenation done, we move to addition and subtraction, working from left to right:
