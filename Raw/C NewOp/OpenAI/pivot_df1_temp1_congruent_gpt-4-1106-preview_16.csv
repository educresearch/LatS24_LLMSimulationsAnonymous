The primary operations to consider here are addition (A) and concatenation (C). According to the new rules, addition must be performed before concatenation.

Given the problem:

We first perform the addition:

5 + 2 = 7

Following that, we then perform the concatenation with the result and 4:

7 @ 4 = 74

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: We need to evaluate the prime factor counting before doing the addition:

8#2 would involve finding the shared unique prime factors of 8 and 2. The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (which is just 2 when considering unique factors), and for the number 2, the only prime factor is 2 itself. So they share one unique prime factor. Thus, 8#2 gives us a count of 1.

6#6 involves finding the shared unique prime factors of 6 and itself, which are just the unique prime factors of 6. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, so 6#6 would count the unique prime factors that 6 has, which are 2 prime factors: 2 and 3.

Now we can add these results together:

1 (from 8#2) + 2 (from 6#6) = 3

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we apply the newly defined order of operations (PEFMDASC). The primary operations to consider here are prime factor counting (F) and addition (A).

Given the expression: 4 # 3 + 2

We proceed as follows:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Evaluate the prime factor counting first. The prime factors of 4 are 2 × 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. They do not share any prime factors, so the result of 4 # 3 is 0.

2. Addition (A): Next, we perform the addition operation. We add the result from step 1 to 2.

Thus, the expression becomes:

0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: Let's follow the newly defined order of operations (PEFMDASC) to solve the given Mathematics problem:

The original problem:
6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3

Step 1: Deal with Parentheses (P)
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F) is next, but we have a concatenation operation before it in the expression, which we cannot evaluate until we have dealt with subtraction. Since there's no prime factor counting operation that can be performed without evaluating the subtraction first, we'll move on to that operation instead. 

Step 3: Since we can't do Prime Factor Counting (F) yet, we move to Addition and Subtraction (A/S). The subtraction to the right has to be evaluated before we can do the concatenation:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 10 # 3 (Subtraction before prime factor counting)

Step 4: Now that the subtraction has been performed, we can do the Prime Factor Counting between 10 and 3:

6 @ 18 + 10 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 0 (10 has prime factors 2 and 5, and 3 is a prime number, hence no shared prime factors)

Step 5: Addition (A), given the updated order and based on the fact that prime factor counting resulted in 0:

6 @ 18 + 0
= 6 @ 18

Step 6: Finally, we have Concatenation (C) which comes last:

6 @ 18
= 618

There are no other operations left to do, so the final answer to the problem based on the new order of operations is:

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we apply the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC). The primary factor counting operation (#) takes precedence over addition.

The expression provided is:

5 + 3#2

Firstly, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation:

3#2 means we need to count the number of unique prime factors that 3 and 2 share. 

3 is a prime number with a prime factor of 3.
2 is a prime number with a prime factor of 2.

Since there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, 3#2 = 0.

Now, substitute this result into our initial expression:

5 + 0

The next step is to perform the addition:

5 + 0 = 5

The answer is 5."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: For the given expression 5 + 2 @ 4, we need to follow the order of operations, PEFMDASC. According to the updated order, we must perform any concatenations (C) after additions (A) but before any subtraction or parentheses.

1. Addition (A)
2. Concatenation (C)

Working through the expression:

1. Perform the addition:
5 + 2 = 7

2. Perform the concatenation with the result from step 1 and the remaining number:

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve the mathematical expression 8#2 + 6#6, we need to follow the order of operations PEFMDASC. 

Let's begin by evaluating the prime factor counting operations (F):

8#2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (since 8 can be factored into 2 * 2 * 2). The only prime factor of 2 is 2 itself. They share the prime factor of 2, so the count of unique prime factors shared is 1.

6#6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since we are comparing 6 with itself, the shared prime factors are 2 and 3. However, even though 2 and 3 are both prime factors of 6, we need to count only the unique prime factors shared. Since 6 shares all its prime factors with itself, but we are counting unique factors, the result is 1.

Now, let's substitute the prime factor counting results back into the expression:

8#2 + 6#6 = 1 + 1

Adding those together gives us the final result:

1 + 1 = 2

So, the final answer is 2.

   4 # 3 involves finding the number of unique prime factors shared by |4| and |3|. The prime factor of 4 is 2, and the prime factor of 3 is 3. Since they don't share any prime factors, 4 # 3 results in 0.

The problem is given as: 6@(14+4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Let's apply the order of operations:

1. Parentheses: Evaluate expressions inside parentheses first.
\[ 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 \]

2. Prime Factor Counting (F): Next, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation.
The prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. They do not share any prime factors.
\[ 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 \]

3. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Perform addition and subtraction from left to right.
\[ 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 = 6 @ 18 + 12 \]

4. Concatenation (C): Lastly, we perform concatenation operation.
Keep in mind that concatenation takes the absolute values of the digits involved. Concatenating 6 with 18 results in 618.
\[ 6 @ 18 + 12 = 618 + 12 \]

Now add 618 and 12:
\[ 618 + 12 = 630 \]

Here are the prime factors of the numbers involved:

- The prime factors of 2 are just 2 itself.

Since 3 and 2 do not share any prime factors, the operation ""3#2"" would result in 0.

6#6: The unique prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since both numbers are 6, their prime factors are the same: 2 and 3. This results in a prime factor count of 2, since there are two unique prime factors present in both numbers.

2. 6 # 6:
The absolute values of 6 and 6 are used, which are 6 and 6. Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and since the second number is the same, it obviously shares both prime factors.
