gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: According to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we have to do addition before concatenation. Therefore, we should calculate the sum of 5 and 2 before performing the concatenation of 2 and 4. 

So, 

5 + 2@4 

= 7 @ 4 (since 5 + 2 = 7)

= 74 (since the concatenation of 7 and 4 is 74)

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: This expression requires the use of operations in the order mentioned in the PEFMDASC rule. 

First, the 'Prime Factor Counting' operation (#) must be performed before 'Addition' operation (+). 

Firstly, evaluate '8 # 2', which represents the count of unique prime factors shared by |8| and |2|. Both 8 and 2 share one unique prime factor which is 2. 

So, 8 # 2 = 1

Next, evaluate '6 # 6', which represents the count of unique prime factors shared by |6| and |6|. Prime factor of 6 is {2,3}, as both numbers are the same, the count of unique prime factors shared is 2.

So, 6 # 6 = 2

Replacing in the original equation, we get: 

1 + 2

Adding these gets us 3.

So, the answer to the expression '8 # 2+6 # 6' applying the new PEFMDASC rule for order of operations is 3.

So, 

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: 4#3 + 2 can be solved as follows:

Step 1: Evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operation:
The prime factor of 4 is 2, and the prime factor of 3 is 3. They have no shared prime factors, so 4#3 equals 0.

Step 2: Evaluate the Addition operation:
0 + 2 equals 2.

So, the answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations PEFMDASC, starting from parentheses all the way to concatenation operation.

First, we evaluate what is in the parentheses: 
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we calculate the Prime Factor Counting operation:
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1
(since the prime factors of 2 are {2} and the prime factors of 3 are {3}, there are no shared prime factors, hence the answer is 0. We can use this result to simplify the equation to:

= 6 @ 18 + 11

Then, we do the addition (before concatenation):
= 6 @ 29

Finally, execute the concatenation operation (which is the last operation to be performed):
= 629

Therefore, the answer to the given mathematics problem is 629, with the final answer rendered as: The answer is 629."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: According to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we have to do the Prime Factor Counting operation first.

The prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. They have no shared prime factors, so 3 # 2 equals 0.

The equation simplifies to:
5 + 0

Summing 5 and 0 gives us 5. 

So, the answer to this problem according to the new order of operations is:

The answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: According to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), it states that we must perform a Concatenation (C) operation before addition or subtraction (A/S). So, we have to perform 2@4 first.

The answer is 29."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem (8 # 2 + 6 # 6) using the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we should calculate the prime factor counting operation first. 

Prime factor counting:

1. 8 # 2: The prime factor of 8 is 2 and the prime factor of 2 is also 2. Therefore, they share only one prime factor which is 2. So, 8 # 2 = 1.
2. 6 # 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since we are looking for unique shared prime factor, we have two of them which are 2 and 3. So, 6 # 6 = 2.

Replacing the prime factor counting operation in the equation, we get:
1 + 2

Now perform the addition operation:
1 + 2 = 3.

So, the solution to the problem 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 is 3.

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: According to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we must evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F) first.

For evaluating 4#3 (the operation F: Prime Factor Counting), the prime factor of 4 is 2, and the prime factor of 3 is 3. Since they do not share any prime factor, 4#3 equals 0.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: According to the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we proceed as follows:

6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3 

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1  
The # operation calculates the number of common prime factors. Both 2 and 3 have only one prime factor: 2. Hence, their common prime factors count is 1.

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
= 6 @ 18 + 11
= 6 @ 29

Step 4: Concatenation (C)
= 629

Therefore, the expression evaluates to 629. So, the answer is 629."

Prime Factor Counting (F):
For a = 3 and b = 2
The only prime factor of 3 is 3 and prime factor of 2 is 2 only.
There are no common prime factors between 3 and 2. Therefore, 3 # 2 = 0.

So, the answer to 5 + 2@4 is 74 according to the update in the order of operations. 

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: First, let's breakdown the steps:

Step 1: Using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operations (#) first.

Here, we have:
8 # 2 = 1 (since 2 is a prime factor of 8)
And
6 # 6 = 1 (since 6 only has 1 unique prime factor, which is 3)

Step 2: So, the expression is now simplified to: 1 + 1.

Step 3: Lastly, we evaluate the addition: 1 + 1 = 2.

Therefore, the final answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: Given: 4#3 + 2
Approach:
The new 'PEFMDASC' order of operations tells us that we need to evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (#) operation before the Addition (+) operation.

First, we will evaluate 4#3.
The prime factor of 4 is 2 and the prime factor of 3 is 3. There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, i.e., 0.

So, the expression simplifies to 0 + 2.

Now, the final remaining operation is addition, so we perform: 0 + 2 = 2.

Therefore, the final answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: The expression is 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3, we can start solving it by adhering to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC):

Step 1: Parentheses
6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3 

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (since prime factor of 2: 2 and prime factor of 3: 3, i.e., zero shared prime factors so 0)

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)
6 @ 18 + 12 - 1
= 6 @ 18 + 11

Then, we perform multiplication and division (M/D), which also do not exist.

After that, we do addition and subtraction(A/S). In the given expression, we have the addition operation 5 + 2:

5 + 2 = 7

After performing the addition operation, the expression has now been simplified to: 7 @ 4

Lastly, according to the order of operation(C), the final operation to be solved is '@' operator. It involves the concatenation of 7 and 4:
