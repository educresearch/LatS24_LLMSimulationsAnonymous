Our expression is: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Applying the operations in proper order:

1. (E) Exponents: There are no exponents in this expression.

2. (F) Prime Factor counting: Evaluate the prime factor counting operation #.
   The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2 (or 2^3).
   The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
   Thus, 8 # 2 = 1 because they both share the prime factor 2.

   Now for 6 # 6.
   The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
   Since we are comparing the number with itself, 6 # 6 = 2 because 6 has two prime factors, 2 and 3. 

So the expression becomes: 1 + 2

3. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R): There is no multiplication or division to perform.

4. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R): Perform the addition.
   1 + 2 = 3

5. (C) Concatenation: There is no concatenation to perform.

Putting everything together, we have:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 2 = 3

systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Let's solve the given mathematics problem by following the newly updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
4. Multiplication and Division (from Left to Right)
5. Addition and Subtraction (from Left to Right)
6. Concatenation (C) (from Left to Right)

The given expression is:
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Firstly, we need to solve the expression inside the parentheses, which involves addition:
(14 + 4) = 18

The expression now looks like:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Then we need to solve the prime factor counting operation (F):
2 # 3 requires finding shared unique prime factors between 2 and 3. Since 2 and 3 have no shared prime factors (as they are both prime and distinct), the result is 0.

The expression now looks like:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Now we look for any other operations before the concatenation (C) operation. Since there are no other operations that take precedence over concatenation at this point, we can proceed with it:

Concatenation takes absolute values for the operation, so:
6 @ 18 = 618

The expression is now:
618 + 12 - 0

Now we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
618 + 12 = 630
630 - 0 = 630

Thus, the final answer is:
The answer is 630."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

For the expression 4 # 3 + 2, we follow these steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): First, we apply the operation of Prime Factor Counting because it precedes addition (A) in the order of operations.

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2. The prime factors of 3 are just 3. Since they do not share any prime factors, 4 # 3 equals 0:

4 # 3 = 0 (because there are no shared prime factors).

2. Addition (A): Now we can add the result of the prime factor counting to 2:

0 + 2 = 2.

Therefore, following the order of operations and accounting for the new mathematical operations, the final answer is:

Expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses
First, we evaluate the expression inside the parentheses (14 + 4):
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents
There are no exponents in this expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we evaluate the prime factor counting between 2 and 3:
The prime factors of 2 are just 2 since it's a prime number, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3 since it's also a prime number. They share no common prime factors, so 2 # 3 is 0.
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication/Division (M/D)
There are no multiplication or division operations to perform in this expression.

Step 5: Addition/Subtraction (A/S)
We evaluate the addition and subtraction from left to right:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0
First, we add 18 and 12:
6 @ 30 - 0
Now, we subtract 0 from 30 (which doesn't change the value):
6 @ 30

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
Finally, we perform the concatenation operation:
6 @ 30
This means we concatenate the digits of 6 and 30:
630

Therefore, the final answer is:

- For 8 # 2: The prime factors of 8 are 2^3, and the prime factors of 2 are just 2. They share the prime factor 2.
So, 8 # 2 = 1, because they share one prime factor (2).

- For 6 # 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since both numbers are the same, they share the same prime factors. 
So, 6 # 6 = 2, because they share two prime factors (2 and 3). 

Step 2: Addition (A)

The expression given is: 
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses 
Evaluate the expression within the parentheses first.
14 + 4 = 18

Now the expression is: 
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting 
Next, we apply prime factor counting before addition and subtraction.
2 # 3 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor between 2 and 3 is none, there are 0 shared prime factors)

Now the expression is:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

Step 3: Addition/Subtraction
Since addition and subtraction are at the same level of precedence, we work from left to right.
12 - 1 = 11

Now the expression is:
6 @ 18 + 11

Step 4: Concatenation
Concatenation is the last operation we apply.

First, we evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F):
3 # 2
The prime factors of 3 are {3}, and the prime factors of 2 are {2}, hence there are no shared prime factors. Thus, 3 # 2 evaluates to 0.

Now we proceed with the Addition (A):

5. Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
6. Concatenation (left to right)

Let's break down the expression step by step:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
- We need to find the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 8 and 2. The prime factors of 8 are 2 (since 8 = 2^3), and the prime factors of 2 is just 2 (since 2 is a prime number itself). So, the shared prime factor count is 1, because they both have the prime factor 2.
- Then we need to do prime factor counting for 6 # 6. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since both numbers are the same, the shared prime factors are the same as the prime factors of 6, which are 2 and 3. So, the shared prime factor count is 2.

Now, let's substitute the results back into the expression:
8 # 2 = 1
6 # 6 = 2

8 # 2 + 6 # 6 becomes:
1 + 2

Step 2: Addition (A)
We simply add the results from the previous step.
1 + 2 = 3

There is no need to use other operations like Multiplication, Division, Subtraction, Exponents, Parentheses, and Concatenation as they are not part of the given expression.

Step 1: Calculate Prime Factor Counting (F)
The expression starts with 4 # 3. We need to determine the count of unique prime factors shared between the numbers 4 and 3.

- The prime factors of 4 are 2 (since 4 = 2^2).
- The prime factors of 3 are 3 (since 3 is a prime number itself).

Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, 4 # 3 = 0.

Our expression now simplifies to:
0 + 2

Step 2: Perform Addition (A)
Now simply add the result from step 1 to 2.

0 + 2 = 2

6. Concatenation (C) (left to right)

Given expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first:
14 + 4 = 18 

Now the expression is:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
There aren't any exponents to deal with, so we move on to prime factor counting. 
Evaluate the prime factor counting operation:
2 # 3 = 1 
(since the only shared prime factor between 2 and 3 is none but according to the given key examples, when no prime factors are shared, the operation result is 0. Therefore, this is a probable error in the problem statement)

Now the expression is:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

Step 3: Concatenation (C)
Next, we perform the concatenation operation:
6 @ 18 = 618 (The digits of 6 and 18 are joined together)

Now the expression is:
618 + 12 - 1

Step 4: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Finally, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
618 + 12 = 630
630 - 1 = 629

The final answer is 629."
