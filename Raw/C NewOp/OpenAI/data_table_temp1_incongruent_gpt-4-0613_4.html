      <td>GPT Response: To solve this given problem, firstly we need to apply the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation:<br><br>(a) 4#3 is equal to 0 because the prime factors of 4 are 2 (2*2) and prime factor of 3 is 3. They do not share any common prime factor. So, it is 0.<br><br>Hence, the problem becomes "0 + 2."<br><br>The "+" operation is an addition operation. So, adding 0 + 2 equals 2.<br><br>Therefore, the final answer to the given problem is 2.<br><br>The answer is 2.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Based on the new order of operations, prime factor counting comes before addition. <br><br>The prime factor of 4 is 2 and the prime factor of 3 is 3.

Here, there are no parentheses, so we move to the next step.<br><br>2) There are no exponent operations in the equation, so we go to the next step.<br><br>3) Now, we have to evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operation (F). In the equation, we have 3 # 2. Here, the unique prime factors for 3 are {3} and for 2 are {2}. There are no shared prime factors, so 3 # 2 = 0.<br><br>So, the equation becomes: 5 + 0.<br><br>4) Next, there are no multiplication or division operations in the equation, so we move on to step 5.<br><br>5) Now we see addition operation.
