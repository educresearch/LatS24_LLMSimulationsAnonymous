                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

In this particular problem, we have an addition operation and a concatenation operation.

Following the order:
1. Parentheses (None present)
2. Exponents (None present)
3. Prime Factor counting (None present)
4. Multiplication and Division (None present)
5. Addition and Subtraction - 5 + 2 needs to be evaluated first
6. Concatenation - The result of the addition should then be concatenated with 4.

Performing the addition first:
5 + 2 = 7

Then performing the concatenation with 4:
7 @ 4 = 74 (we simply join the two numbers as per the definition of the concatenation operation)

So the final answer is:

3. (F) Prime Factor Counting: We have two prime factor counting operations to perform.

   - 8 # 2: The unique prime factors of 8 are 2 (since 8 = 2^3), and the unique prime factors of 2 is obviously 2. So they share one prime factor (2).
   - Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1 (there is 1 shared prime factor).

   - 6 # 6: The unique prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 (since 6 = 2 * 3). Since we're comparing the number with itself, all the unique prime factors match.
   - Therefore, 6 # 6 = 2 (there are 2 shared prime factors).

Next, we handle the prime factor counting (F):

Since the prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3—there are no shared prime factors, so:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Now we proceed with the addition (A):

6 @ (18 + 12) - 0

6 @ 30 - 0

Since there is no multiplication or division involved (M and D), we move on to subtraction (S):

6 @ 30 - 0 = 6 @ 30 = 630 - 0

                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1.

                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)

Given the problem: 5 + 3 # 2

Let's perform the prime factor counting operation first:

1. Evaluate 3 # 2: The unique prime factors of 3 are {3}, and the unique prime factors of 2 are {2}. There are no common prime factors between 3 and 2, so the result of 3 # 2 is 0.

First, we evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F) before we do any addition (A):

1. Since the prime factors of \( 8 \) are \( 2 \times 2 \times 2 \) (or \( 2^3 \)) and the prime factors of \( 2 \) are just \( 2 \), they both share the prime factor \( 2 \). Thus, \( 8 \# 2 = 1 \) (since there is one unique shared prime factor \( 2 \)).
2. Next, the prime factors of \( 6 \) are \( 2 \times 3 \). So, \( 6 \# 6 = 2 \) (since there are two unique shared prime factors, \( 2 \) and \( 3 \), because we are looking at the same number's prime factors).

Now the equation simplifies to:

\( 1 + 2 \)

Here's the given expression:

Firstly, we attend to the Prime Factor Counting operation (#):

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
The prime factors of 3 are 3.
Since 4 and 3 do not share any prime factors, the result of the operation 4 # 3 is 0.

Now we rewrite the expression with the result of the prime factor counting:

0 + 2

Next, we perform addition, which is straightforward:

0 + 2 = 2

So the final answer is:

Here, we only need to concern ourselves with Prime Factor Counting (F) and Addition (A), as there are no parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, subtraction, or concatenation involved.

Given problem: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)

8 # 2:
The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2.
The prime factors of 2 are 2.
The unique prime factors shared between 8 and 2 are 2.
So, 8 # 2 equals 1 (since the number 2 is the unique shared prime factor). 

6 # 6:
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
The prime factors of 6 are again 2 and 3.
The unique prime factors shared between 6 and 6 are 2 and 3.
So, 6 # 6 equals 2 (since there are two shared prime factors: 2 and 3).

Step 2: Addition (A)

From Step 1, we have:
1 + 2 

Adding these together, we get:
3

The final answer to the given problem is 3.

The original expression is:
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

First, we handle what's inside the parentheses (P):
14 + 4 = 18
The expression now becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we handle the Prime Factor Counting (F):
The prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3, with no common prime factors.
Thus, 2 # 3 = 0
The expression now becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Now, we deal with Addition/Subtraction (A/S) from left to right:
12 - 0 = 12
The expression now becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12

Finally, we handle Concatenation (C) from left to right:
6 @ 18 → Concatenate the digits of 6 and 18 to get 618
The expression now becomes:
618 + 12

The last operation is the addition:

                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

Since there are none, we move on to exponents, of which there are also none. 

Next in line is Prime Factor Counting (F). We have 3 # 2 in the expression, which we need to evaluate. 

The prime factors of 3 are 3, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. There are no common prime factors between 3 and 2, so:

3 # 2 = 0 (since there is no shared prime factor)

Now we substitute that result back into the original expression:

5 + 0

After Prime Factor Counting, we proceed with Addition (A). We add 5 and 0:

5 + 0 = 5

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 5."

     The prime factor of 2 is just 2.
     The count of unique shared prime factors between 8 and 2 is just 1 (since they share the prime factor 2).

   - 6 # 6: To find the prime factors of 6 and 6:
     The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
     Since both numbers are the same, they share all the prime factors. 
     However, we are only counting unique prime factors, so we only count each prime factor once regardless of how many times it appears. 
     Thus, 6 # 6 also has a count of unique shared prime factors of 2 (since they share the prime factors 2 and 3).

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): The first step is to do prime factor counting between 4 and 3.
   - The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
   - The prime factors of 3 is 3.
   There are no common prime factors between 4 and 3, so the result of 4 # 3 is 0.

2. Addition (A): Next, we add the result of the prime factor counting to 2.
   - Since 4 # 3 = 0, we calculate 0 + 2.

3. Conclusion: Add 0 and 2 to get the final answer.

Given expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses
Solve expressions inside the parentheses first.

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents
There are no exponents to evaluate.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Evaluate the prime factor counting operation next.

2 # 3 will give us the count of unique prime factors shared between 2 and 3.
The prime factors of 2 are {2}, and the prime factors of 3 are {3}. Since they share no prime factors, this results in:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
There are no operations of multiplication or division to evaluate.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Now we can perform addition and subtraction from left to right:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0
= 6 @ 18 + 12
= 6 @ 30  (performing the addition before the concatenation)

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
Finally, we apply the concatenation operation:

6 @ 30 = 630
The answer is 630."
