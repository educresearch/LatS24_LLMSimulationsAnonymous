Step 1: Parentheses
In this case, there is a set of parentheses: (14 + 4). We will first evaluate the expression in the parentheses.
14 + 4 = 18

So, the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents
There are no exponents in the given expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting
Next, we will evaluate the prime factor counting operation. The prime factor counting operation has higher priority than addition, subtraction, and concatenation, so we will perform it before the other operations.

2 # 3 = 1 (since the only shared prime factor between 2 and 3 is 1)
So, the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2

Step 4: Multiplication and Division
There are no multiplication or division operations in the given expression.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction
Next, we will evaluate the addition and subtraction operations from left to right.

6 @ 18 = 618 (since concatenation is performed from left to right)
618 + 12 = 630
630 - 2 = 628

So, the expression becomes: 628

Step 6: Concatenation
Finally, we will evaluate the concatenation operation.

628 is the final answer.
