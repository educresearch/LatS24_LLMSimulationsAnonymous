Next, let's evaluate the prime factor counting:

Now, we can perform the concatenation:
6 @ 18 = 618 (concatenating the digits of 6 and 18)

Finally, let's do the remaining operations from left to right:

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

                    (i) 5 @ 3 + 6

                    = 59

                    (ii) 5 # 3 + 6
                    = 0 + 6 (since we need to evaluate prime factorization before addition)
                    = 6

                    (iii) 5 - 3 @ 6
                    = 2 @ 6 (since we need to evaluate subtraction before concatenation)
                    = 26

                    (iv) 5 - 3 # 6
                    = 5 - 1 (since we need to evaluate prime factorization before subtraction)
                    = 4

1. Prime factor counting (F)
2. Addition (A)

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Prime factor counting (F):
   - 8 # 2: The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 2 are only 2. The shared prime factor is 2.
   - 6 # 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 6 are also 2 and 3. The shared prime factors are 2 and 3.

   Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1 and 6 # 6 = 2.

2. Addition (A):

1. First, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation (#). 
   The prime factors of 5 are 5, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. There are no shared prime factors between them, so 5 # 3 = 0.

2. Next, we perform addition (A). 
   Since there are no other operations to perform, we add 5 and 0, resulting in 5 + 0 = 5.

Therefore, the answer is 5."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

The prime factors of 2 are 2.

Now, let's find the prime factors of 6 and 6.
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.

Step 1: Evaluate the prime factor counting (F)
4 # 3 = 1
Since the prime factors of 4 are 2^2 and the prime factor of 3 is 3, there is only 1 shared prime factor, which is 2.

Step 2: Evaluate the addition (A)
1 + 2 = 3

Therefore, the answer is 3."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

Step 1: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses.
(14 + 4) = 18

The expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Evaluate the concatenation operation (@) from left to right.
6 @ 18 = 618

The expression becomes: 618 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 3: Evaluate the subtraction operation (-) from left to right.
618 + 12 = 630 - 2 # 3

Step 4: Evaluate the prime factor counting operation (#) from left to right.
2 # 3 = 1
Note: The prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. There is only one shared prime factor, which is 2.

The expression becomes: 630 - 1

Step 5: Evaluate the subtraction operation (-).
630 - 1 = 629
