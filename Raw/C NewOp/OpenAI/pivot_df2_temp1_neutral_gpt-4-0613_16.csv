4 # 3 = 0 (since both 4 and 3 don't have a shared prime factor)

The expression simplifies to 0 + 2.

Using the rules of addition, we get 0 + 2 = 2.

So, the answer is 2.","GPT Response: The problem is: 4 # 3 + 2

According to the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to perform prime factor counting (F) before addition (A).

Prime factor of 4 is 2, and prime factor of 3 is 3. Thus, 4 # 3 = 0 because they have no common prime factors.

Substitute the result into the original expression: 0 + 2 = 2.

So, the answer is 2.","GPT Response: The expression given is 4 # 3 + 2.

Following the PEFMDAS rule:

1) Prime Factor Counting (#):
   The prime factors of 4 are 2 x 2.
   The prime factors of 3 are 3.
   There are no common prime factors in 4 and 3.
   Hence, 4 # 3 = 0.

So, the expression becomes:

gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: In this problem, we're being asked to compute the value of the expression 5 + 3 # 2.

Here's how we can apply the new order of operations to do this:

First, we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operation 3 # 2. The prime factors of 2 and 3 are respectively 2 and 3 with no shared factors, so the result of this operation is 0.

So the initial equation modifies to: 5 + 0.

Now, all we have left is the addition operation, which gives us 5.

So, the evaluation of 5 + 3 # 2 is 5.

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: In this problem, there are two operations: addition (+) and prime factor counting (#). According to the new order of operations, Prime Factor Counting (F) comes before Addition (A). Therefore, first perform the Prime Factor counting operation, and then the addition.

Step 1: Prime Factor counting
Factorize the absolute values of 3 and 2. Both 3 and 2 are prime numbers, so the prime factors of 3 are {3} and for 2 are {2}. The primary factor they share in common is none, so 3 # 2 = 0.

Step 2: Addition
Now we add 5 and the result of 3 # 2 (i.e., 0), and that gives us 5 + 0 = 5.

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: Here's how you can solve the given problem:

Given: 5 + 3 # 2

Remember the order of operations PEFMDASC, Prime Factor Counting (F) has precedence over Addition (A). Hence, we first compute the operation 3 # 2, which is finding the unique common prime factors between the absolute values of 3 and 2. 

The prime factors of 3 are {3}, and the prime factors of 2 are {2}. There are no common prime factors between 3 and 2. Therefore, 3 # 2 = 0.

So, the answer is 629.","GPT Response: To solve this problem with the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we will go step by step to understand the equation:

(i) Resolve Parentheses first : 

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
14 + 4 = 18
which gives us 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

(ii) Then we perform Prime Factor counting :

2 # 3 = 1 since the prime factors of 3 are 1 and 3, and the prime factors of 2 are only 2, thus they don't share any prime factors.
This leaves us with 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

(iii) Then perform Addition and Subtraction :

18 + 12 - 1 = 29, 
So, 6 @ 29

(iv) Finally the last operation to perform is Concatenation : 

6 @ 29 = 629.

gpt-4-0613,1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: In the problem, the two operations you need to perform are the prime factor counting operation and the addition operation.

Firstly, you would calculate the primary factor count of numbers:

1. The prime factor of 8 is 2 (2x2x2), and the prime factor of 2 is 2. They share one prime factor in common hence 8 # 2 = 1.
2. The prime factor of 6 is 2 and 3. Here, 6 # 6 refers to the count of unique prime factors shared by the same number, 6. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, so it shares 2 prime factors with itself, hence 6 # 6 = 2.

The problem can now be simplified to:
1 + 2

Next, you perform the addition operation to get the answer:
1 + 2 = 3

So, the answer to the problem 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 based on the new mathematics operation is 3.

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: First, we will calculate 8 # 2 (prime factor counting) and 6 # 6 separately, according to the order of operations, PEFMDASC. F comes before A (addition), so this is the order.

The only prime factor of 8 (which is 2) is shared with 2, so the value of 8 # 2 is 1.

For 6 # 6, since both numbers are the same, they share the same prime factors. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. So, there are 2 unique prime factors, meaning the value of 6 # 6 is 2.

Now, deal with the addition: 1 + 2

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: According to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC):

First, apply the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation:

8 # 2 = 1 (since 2 is the only prime factor shared by 8 and 2)

And, 6 # 6 = 1 (since 6 and 6 have the same prime factors, in this case 2 and 3)

so, we get 1 + 1 

Finally, solve addition to get 1 + 1 = 2

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Following the PEFMDASC order of operations, let's solve the problem: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

First, we should carry out Prime Factor Counting operations:

(ii) 8 # 2
The unique prime factors of 8 are 2 (since 8 = 2^3), and the unique prime factors of 2 are also 2. 

So, 8 # 2 = 1 (since they share 1 common unique prime factor, which is 2.)

(iv) 6 # 6
The unique prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and for the same number (which is 6), the prime factors will also be 2 and 3.

So, 6 # 6 = 2 (since they share 2 common unique prime factors, which are 2 and 3.)

Now, replace the Prime Factor Counting operations with the corresponding values we found:

Original: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6
After Prime Factor Counting: 1 + 2

Next, perform Addition, which will give us the final result.

Adding the values together gives us:

1 + 2 = 3 

Therefore, the final answer to the expression is 3. 

The answer is 3."
