5 + 2 @ 4

First, we acknowledge that there are no operations involving parentheses (P), exponents (E), or prime factor counting (F). Since multiplication (M) and division (D) also do not apply, we move on to addition (A) and subtraction (S). However, according to the new order of operations, concatenation (C) is evaluated last, after addition and subtraction.

Therefore, we first perform the addition and then the concatenation:

5 + 2 = 7

Now we have:

7 @ 4

Next, we perform the concatenation operation:

7 @ 4 = 74

The final answer to the given problem is 74.

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

First, we handle the parentheses (P):
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we handle the prime factor counting (F):
We calculate the count of unique prime factors shared by |2| and |3|. The prime factor of 2 is 2, and the prime factor of 3 is 3. There is no shared prime factor, so:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

According to the new order, there are no exponents (E) to be handled here, so we skip to multiplication and division (MD), but there are none present either.

Next, we perform addition (A) and subtraction (S):
6 @ 18 + 12 = 6 @ 30
We must perform the addition before we can consider concatenation. We continue with:
6 @ 30 - 0
Subtraction is next because there are no multiplications or divisions preceding it in the operation string.

Now we have:
6 @ 30
Finally, we perform concatenation (C):
6 @ 30 = 630 (since concatenation simply joins the two numbers together)

So, the final answer is:

                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):

                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

However, there is a new operation here, Concatenation (C), which according to the order of operations provided, comes after Addition/Subtraction. Therefore, we must perform the addition before the concatenation.

Here's how we evaluate the expression step by step:

1. Perform the addition operation (5 + 2):
5 + 2 = 7

2. Then, perform the concatenation with the result of step 1 and 4 (7 @ 4):
7 @ 4 = 74 (Concatenation means to join the numbers at the digit level, which in this case is straightforward as there are no negative numbers or decimals involved)

First, we address the Prime Factor counting (F), which has higher precedence than addition (A):

4 # 3: 

- The prime factors of 4 are 2 (since 4 can be expressed as \(2^2\)).
- The prime factors of 3 are just 3 (since 3 is a prime number).

There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so:

4 # 3 = 0

**E**xponents: There are no exponents in the expression.

**F**actor Counting: Now we evaluate the prime factor counting:
2 # 3 = 0 (since the prime factors of 2 are just 2, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3, so there are no shared prime factors)

**A**ddition/**S**ubtraction: Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:

The operations present are addition (A) and concatenation (C). According to the new order of operations, we need to perform addition before concatenation.

So we will first add 5 and 2:
\( 5 + 2 = 7 \)

After the addition, we concatenate the result with 4:

- The prime factors for 8 are 2 x 2 x 2.
- The prime factors for 2 are 2.
- The common prime factor is 2 (counted once, even though 8 has multiple 2s).
So, 8 # 2 = 1.

(b) 6 # 6
- The prime factors for 6 are 2 x 3.
- We're looking for the count of unique common prime factors of 6 and 6, which are just 2 and 3 (both counted once).
So, 6 # 6 = 2.

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

1. Parentheses 
First, we calculate the expression inside the parentheses:

(14 + 4) = 18

So, the expression becomes:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we need to perform the prime factor counting operation:

2 # 3 = 0

Since 2 is a prime factor itself and 3 is a prime factor itself (there are no common prime factors), the resulting count is 0.

Now, the expression becomes:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

3. Concatenation (C)
Then, we have to perform the concatenation operation:

6 @ 18 = 618 (joining the digits of 6 and 18)

Now, the expression becomes:

618 + 12 - 0

4. Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Finally, we handle addition and subtraction from left to right:

618 + 12 = 630

630 - 0 = 630

After following the updated order of operations, we get the final answer:

5 + 3 # 2

We first look for any operations that involve parentheses (P), exponents (E), or prime factor counting (F). There are no parentheses or exponents, but we must address the prime factor counting operation '3 # 2'.

Prime factor counting (F) for '3 # 2':
The prime factor of 3 is 3, and the prime factor of 2 is 2; since they do not share any common prime factors, '3 # 2' equals 0.

The expression now simplifies to:
5 + 0

Following through with addition (A):
5 + 0 = 5

There are no other operations to perform since the rest (M/D for multiplication/division, S for subtraction, and C for concatenation) are not present in this problem.

Therefore, the final answer is:
The answer is 5."

Now we can proceed with the calculation:

First, do the addition, as there are no operations that take precedence over it in this expression:
\( 5 + 2 = 7 \)

Now we concatenate the result of the addition with the specified number:
\( 7 @ 4 \)

Since concatenation just joins the digits together:

- \( 6 # 6 \): The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since both numbers are the same, they share the same prime factors. In this case, there are two unique shared prime factors which are 2 and 3, hence \( 6 # 6 = 2 \).

systemPrompt4_userPrompt3_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the expression \(4 # 3 + 2\) using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we must address the operations in the following order:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D from left to right)
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S from left to right)
6. Concatenation (C from left to right)

Since there are no parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, or concatenation in the given expression, we will start with the Prime Factor Counting (F), followed by Addition (A).

The expression is as follows:
\(4 # 3 + 2\)

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Find the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 4 and 3. 
The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (or just 2 when considering unique factors), and the prime factor of 3 is 3. They share no common prime factors.

So, \(4 # 3 = 0\).

Step 2: Addition (A)
Now we add the result of the prime factor counting to 2.

\(0 + 2\)

The sum is \(2\).

The answer is \(2\)."

Expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting between 2 and 3. Since they share no common prime factors:

Expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses to evaluate.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents to evaluate.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We have \(3 \# 2\). The absolute values of 3 and 2 are used, so we find the unique prime factors of both 3 and 2.

- The unique prime factor of 3 is 3.
- The unique prime factor of 2 is 2.
- There are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2.

So, \(3 \# 2\) evaluates to 0 because there are no shared unique prime factors.

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): No multiplication or division is to be performed.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We now perform the addition operation which includes the result of \(3 \# 2 = 0.\)
