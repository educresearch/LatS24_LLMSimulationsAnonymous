systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Let's break this down following the new PEFMDASC order of operations.

The given problem is 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3.

Step 1 (Parentheses): We need to evaluate 14+4 which is 18. The result is 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3.

Step 2 (Exponents): There are no operations in this problem involving exponents.

Step 3 (Prime Factor Counting): We need to evaluate 2#3. As the prime factors of both 2 and 3 are themselves, they do not share any prime factors, so 2#3 is 0. The result is 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0.

Step 4 & 5 (Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction: L to R): There are no operations in this problem involving multiplication and division. But there is a + operation.

We perform the sequence here. Start with 6 @ 18 which gives us 618. Then add 12 which gives 630. Finally subtract 0 to still get 630.

Thus, the answer to the given problem 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3 following the new PEFMDASC order of operations is 630.

The answer is 630."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

                    (i) 5 @ 3 + 6

(since prime factor of 2 is 2 and prime factor of 3 is 3, i.e., there is no shared prime factor)

Steps:
(i) For 8 # 2, the prime factors of 8 are 2 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Thus, they have 1 common prime factor. Hence, 8 # 2 = 1.
(ii) For 6 # 6, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and so for the another 6. Thus, they have 2 common prime factors. Hence, 6 # 6 = 2.

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together.

Since addition comes before concatenation in the order of operations, we'll perform the addition first:

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Let's break this down using the PEFMDASC order of operations.

Problem: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

Step 1: Parentheses come first in the PEFMDASC order. So, we need to resolve the operation inside the parentheses (14+4).
        6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting comes before Addition and Subtraction in PEFMDASC. It's represented by '#'. We need to calculate 2#3.
        Since 2 and 3 are both prime numbers and they don't have any shared prime factors, 2#3 equals 0.
        6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3: Addition comes before Concatenation in the PEFMDASC order, so we'll perform 18 + 12.
        6 @ 30 - 0

Step 4: Subtraction also comes before Concatenation, then it's 30 - 0.
        6 @ 30

Step 5: Finally, we perform the Concatenation (C). Since Concatenation is just joining numbers together, it's 6 @ 30 = 630.
        
The answer is 630."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To evaluate 5 + 3 # 2, we have to follow the PEFMDASC order of operations. Based on the new order, Prime Factor counting (#) takes precedence over Addition (+).

Let's first handle the ""3 # 2"" operation. The # operator counts the number of unique prime factors shared between two numbers. The prime factors of 3 are 3, while the prime factors of 2 are 2. As there are no common prime factors, 3 # 2 equals 0. 

Now our expression has been simplified to 5 + 0.

Finally, we perform the addition using the standard rules of algebra. We get:

5 + 0 = 5

So, according to the PEFMDASC order of operations, the result of 5 + 3 # 2 is 5.

The answer is 5."
