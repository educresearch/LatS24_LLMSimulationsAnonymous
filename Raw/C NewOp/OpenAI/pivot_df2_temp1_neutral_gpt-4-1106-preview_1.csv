4 # 3 + 2

Using the newly updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Evaluate Prime Factor Counting (#) before addition.
2. Add the result from the Prime Factor Counting to 2.

Let's evaluate the operations step by step:

4 # 3
The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (or just 2, since we consider unique prime factors), and the prime factors of 3 are just 3. Since there are no shared prime factors, the result of this operation is:

4 # 3 = 0

Now we add the result of the Prime Factor Counting operation to 2:

0 + 2 = 2

Hence, the final answer is:

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: First, we need to follow the revised order of operations PEFMDASC. 

Firstly, we resolve the Prime Factor Counting (F):

4 # 3

The prime factors of 4 are 2 x 2, while the prime factors of 3 are just 3. Since they do not share any prime factors, we get:

4 # 3 = 0

Now we add (A) the result to 2:

0 + 2 = 2

So, the final answer is 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Let's solve the problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC):

2. Multiplication and Division (M/D) (from left to right)
3. Addition and Subtraction (A/S) (from left to right)
4. Concatenation (C) (from left to right)

Given the mathematical expression: 4 # 3 + 2

We start with prime factor counting:

4 # 3

The prime factors of 4 are: 2 * 2
The prime factors of 3 are: 3

Since there are no common prime factors between 4 and 3, the result of 4 # 3 is:

4 # 3 = 0

Now we have:

0 + 2

Next, we simply perform the addition:

0 + 2 = 2

6. Concatenation (C)

The given expression is 4 # 3 + 2. There are no parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, or concatenation to process, so we start with the Prime Factor Counting (F):

Step 1: Evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F)
4 # 3
The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (since 4 is 2^2). The prime factor of 3 is 3. There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so 4 # 3 is 0.

5 + 2 @ 4

We apply the new order of operations: PEFMDASC (Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right, and finally Concatenation from left to right).

In this expression, we do not have any parentheses, exponents, or prime factor counting to consider. The operations present are addition and concatenation.

According to the order of operations, we should perform addition before concatenation. So, we first add 5 and 2, then apply the concatenation with 4.

5 + 2 = 7

Now we apply the concatenation with 7 and 4:

7 @ 4 = 74

The final result of the expression is 74.

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: To solve the given expression 5 + 2 @ 4, we need to follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

- E: Exponents
- F: Prime Factor counting
- M/D: Multiplication and Division (left to right)
- A/S: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
- C: Concatenation (left to right)

Following the order, we first evaluate concatenation before addition because concatenation is now the last operation to be performed in the order of operations.

So we evaluate 2 @ 4 first:

2 @ 4 = 24 (since concatenation combines the digits).

Now, we perform the addition:

5 + 24 = 29

The final expression is simplified to:

The answer is 29.","GPT Response: Let's solve the problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC):

5 + 2 @ 4

According to the updated order of operations, Concatenation (C) comes after Addition and Subtraction (A/S). Therefore, we first perform the addition and then the concatenation:

Start with addition (5 + 2):
5 + 2 = 7

Now perform concatenation with the result of addition and 4 (7 @ 4):
7 @ 4 = 74 (since concatenation merges the digits)

Thus, 5 + 2 @ 4 = 74.

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: Let's work through the problem step-by-step following the PEFMDASC order of operations.

4. Multiplication/Division (M/D) – Not applicable.
5. Addition/Subtraction (A/S) – We have addition in 5 + 2, but we cannot do this operation yet since Concatenation (C) comes before addition in our newly updated order of operations.
6. Concatenation (C) – We perform concatenation for 2 @ 4. This operation joins the digits of 2 and 4 together:

   2 @ 4 = 24

7. Now we can perform the addition since no other operations are left:

For the expression 5 + 3 # 2, prime factor counting (F) comes before addition (A):

1. Prime factor counting (\#):
The prime factors of 3 are 3 itself, and the prime factors of 2 are 2 itself. There is no common prime factor, so 3 # 2 = 0.

There are no shared prime factors, so:

   - The absolute value of 2 is 2, which has a prime factor of 2.
   - There are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2.

- Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
- Concatenation (C)

Following this order:

1. Solve inside the parentheses (P):
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Now we look for prime factor counting (F):
Since prime factors of 2 are 2 and prime factors of 3 are 3, there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3.
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

5. Addition/Subtraction (A/S) (left to right)
6. Concatenation (C) (left to right)

Given expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Resolve parentheses (P)
\( 6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 # 3 \)

Step 2: There are no exponents to resolve (E).

Step 3: Perform prime factor counting (F)
\( 2 \) and \( 3 \) are the prime factors for \( 6 \). \( 2 # 3 \) means we are counting the number of unique prime factors shared by \( 2 \) and \( 3 \). Since \( 2 \) and \( 3 \) have no shared prime factors, this results in \( 0 \).
\( 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 \)

Steps 4 and 5: There is no multiplication or division to resolve (M/D), so perform addition/subtraction (A/S) (left to right)
\( 6 @ 18 + 12 \)
\( (6 @ 18) \) comes first due to concatenation being last in the order.
\( 6 @ 18 \) is the concatenation of \( 6 \) and \( 18 \), resulting in \( 618 \).
Now add \( 12 \) to it:
\( 618 + 12 = 630 \)

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the problem ""8 # 2 + 6 # 6"" with the newly defined operations and the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation before the addition.

1. Evaluate 8 # 2:
The absolute values of 8 and 2 are taken (though it doesn't matter in this case since both are positive), and then we determine the shared unique prime factors. The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or just 2 when considering unique factors). The prime factor of 2 is 2. Therefore, 8 and 2 share one unique prime factor, which is 2.

So, 8 # 2 = 1

2. Evaluate 6 # 6:
The absolute values of 6 and 6 are 6 and 6, and the unique prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since we're considering the same number, it has the same set of unique prime factors, so 6 and 6 share two unique prime factors: 2 and 3.

So, 6 # 6 = 2

3. Perform the addition:
Now that we have evaluated the prime factor counting, we can add the results together as per the order of operations.

1 + 2 = 3

Finally, the answer to the given problem is 3.

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: First, we evaluate the prime factor counting operations, as these come before addition according to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC).

For 8 # 2:
The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (i.e., 2^3).
The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
The shared prime factor is 2 (one unique prime factor). Thus, 8 # 2 = 1.

For 6 # 6:
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
Since both numbers are the same, the shared prime factors are the same as the prime factors of 6, which are 2 and 3. However, we are only counting the number of unique shared prime factors, which is 2 (since 2 and 3 are both prime and unique). Thus, 6 # 6 = 2.

With those results, our expression now is:
8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 2.

Now we perform the addition:
1 + 2 = 3.

8 # 2:

The prime factors of 2 are 2.
The unique shared prime factor is 2.
Thus, 8 # 2 equals 1.

6 # 6:
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
Since both numbers are the same, they share the same prime factors.
Thus, 6 # 6 equals 2, because there are two prime factors in 6, and they are all shared.

Next, we perform the Addition (A):

1 + 2 = 3

Remember, # denotes prime factor counting:
- For the number 8, the prime factors are 2, 2, and 2 (or \(2^3\)).
- For the number 2, the only prime factor is 2 itself.
- 8 # 2 counts the number of unique prime factors that 8 and 2 share, which is just one: the prime factor 2.
So, 8 # 2 equals 1 because they share one prime factor (the number 2).

Now let's look at the next part:
- For the number 6, the prime factors are 2 and 3.
- 6 # 6 also counts the number of unique prime factors that each 6 shares, which in this case will include both 2 and 3.
So, 6 # 6 equals 2 because 6 shares two prime factors with itself (the numbers 2 and 3).
