3. F: We need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation before addition. 
   The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.

First, we check for any operations in parentheses, but there are none in this expression.

Next, we evaluate any exponents, but there are none.

Then, we move on to prime factor counting (F). The prime factors of 4 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since there are no shared prime factors, 4#3 equals 0.

After evaluating prime factor counting, we move on to multiplication and division (M/D). Again, there are none in this expression to evaluate.

Finally, we perform addition and subtraction (A/S) from left to right. 4#3 equals 0, so the expression simplifies to 0 + 2.

The sum of 0 and 2 is 2. Therefore, the answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve the given expression using the PEFMDASC order, let's break it down step by step:

Step 1: Evaluate the prime factor counting operation (#):
4 # 3 -> The prime factors of 4 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3.
          The shared prime factors between 4 and 3 are none.
