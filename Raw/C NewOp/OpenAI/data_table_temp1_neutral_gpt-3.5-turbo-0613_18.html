There are no parentheses in this expression, so we move on to the next operation, which is prime factor counting (F). The prime factors of 5 are only 5 itself, and the prime factors of 3 are only 3 itself. Since there is no shared prime factor between 5 and 3, the result of 5 # 3 is 0.<br><br>So, the expression becomes 5 + 0 # 2. Moving on to the next operation, which is addition (A), we have 5 + 0, which gives us 5. Finally, we evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation between the result (5) and 2. The prime factors of 5 are only 5 itself, and the prime factors of 2 are only 2 itself. Again, there is no shared prime factor, so the result of 5 # 2 is 0.<br><br>Therefore, the final answer is 5.</td>
