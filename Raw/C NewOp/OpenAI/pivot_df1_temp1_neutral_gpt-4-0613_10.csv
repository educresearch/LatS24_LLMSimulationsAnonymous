gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve this using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we follow the steps as follows:

(i) Parentheses: There are none in this equation.
(ii) Exponents: There are also none.
(iii) Prime factor counting: There are also none.
(iv) Multiplication and Division: There are also none.
(v) Addition and Subtraction: There is an addition operation (5 + 2). We have to resolve this before going to the Concatenation operation.
(vi) So, we resolve 5 + 2 = 7.
(vii) Applying the Concatenation operation (@), which is the last operation to perform:
=> 7 @ 4 = 74.

So, The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: First, we should do the operation for prime factor counting as it comes before addition according to the PEFMDASC rule.

To compute 8 # 2, we consider the prime factors of 8 (which is 2) and 2 (which is also 2). The count of unique shared prime factors is 1.

For the operation 6 # 6, the prime factor for 6 is 2 and 3. Since both numbers are the same, they share all the prime factors. Thus, the count is 2.

Then, according to the PEFMDASC order of operations, addition comes next so we add the results of these two prime factor counting operations together.

So, we have:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6 becomes 

1 (8 # 2 result) + 2 (6 # 6 result) equals 3

So, The answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we follow the steps as follows:

(i) Prime Factor counting (F):

The prime factor of 4 is 2, and the prime factor of 3 is 3. As there are no shared prime factors, 4 # 3 equals 0.

(ii) Addition (A): 

We then perform the addition operation. So, 0 + 2 equals 2.

Based on these operations, The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: In this problem, the first operation we should carry out is what is in the parenthesis, so:

= 6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we need to calculate the result of the prime factor counting operation, which is 2 # 3. The prime factor of 2 is 2 and the prime factor of 3 is 3, therefore they don't share any prime factors, so:

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Follow PEFMDASC, the next operation should be the addition:

= 6 @ 18 + 12

= 6 @ 30

Next is concatenation:

= 630

Hence, the answer is 630."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve this using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we follow the steps as follows:

(i) Prime Factor counting (F):

The prime factor of 3 is 3, and the prime factor of 2 is 2. As there are no shared prime factors, 3 # 2 equals 0.

(ii) Addition (A): 

We then perform the addition operation, 5 + 0 = 5.

So, the answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: First, consider the new order of operations, PEFMDASC. According to this, we have first to do the Addition and then the Concatenation operation.

(i) 5 + 2 = 7

(ii) 7 @ 4 = 74

Therefore,

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: First, we apply the Prime Factor counting (F) operation. Absolute values of the numbers are used and unique prime factors are determined before counting shared factors. 

8 # 2 = |-8| # |2| = 8 # 2.
The prime factors of 8 are 2 (which is repeated 3 times), and the prime factors of 2 are 2 (which is apparent). Therefore, we have 1 shared prime factor, and hence 8 # 2 is 1.

Next, we look at 6 # 6. 
This is equal to |-6| # |-6| = 6 # 6.
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and they are the same for the second 6. Therefore, we have 2 shared prime factors, and hence 6 # 6 is 2.

Finally, we perform the operations in order, so the equation becomes: 

1 + 2 = 3

Therefore, the answer is 3. So,

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, we need to solve for 4 # 3. # operation represents the prime factor counting. Therefore, we will identify the unique prime factors of 4 and 3. The only prime factor for 4 is 2 and the only prime factor for 3 is 3. The operation 4 # 3 therefore equals 0 as there are no shared unique prime factors. 

Next, we add this result to 2.  So the sum is 0 + 2 = 2.

Therefore, the final answer is 2. 

So, ""The answer is 2."""
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: To solve the problem, we follow the new order of operations, PEFMDASC:

First, we address Parentheses (P):
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3
(This is because we need to evaluate the addition, 14 + 4, within the brackets first.)

Second, we perform Prime Factor counting (F):
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1
(This is because 3 is prime, while 2 has only one prime factor, 2.)

Third, we address Addition and Subtraction (A/S), from left to right:
= 6 @ 30 - 1
= 6 @ 29
(This is because we need to evaluate addition before subtraction, and subtraction before concatenation.)

Followed by Concatenation (C):
= 629

So, the answer is 629."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: First, we need to solve for 3 # 2. # operation represents Prime Factor Counting. Therefore, we find the shared prime factors between 3 and 2. 

The only prime factor for 3 is 3 and the only prime factor for 2 is 2. As there are no shared prime factors, 3 # 2 = 0. 

The equation is thus simplified to 5 + 0. The answer to this is 5.

The answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Given the expression 5 + 2 @ 4, 

We'll execute the operations following the updated Order of Operations, PEFMDASC. 

So, we prioritize Addition over Concatenation:
= 7 @ 4 (since we need to evaluate addition before concatenation)
= 74 (then we perform the concatenation)

Thus, the answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: Let's follow the new order of operations PEFMDASC.

The given mathematical expression is: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Start by applying the prime factor counting (F):

For 8 # 2, there is 1 common prime factor, which is 2. So, 8 # 2 becomes 1.

For 6 # 6, both numbers have the same prime factors, and since the only prime factor for 6 is 2 & 3, they have 2 prime factors in common. Therefore, 6 # 6 becomes 2.

So, the entire expression now is 1 + 2.

Finally, the operation of addition (A) is simple because it only requires adding these results:

1 + 2 = 3

So the answer to the given problem is: The answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we have to follow the new rules and orders of operations, PEFMDASC:

First, we need to find the prime factor counting of 4 and 3, represented as 4 # 3.

The prime factors of 4 are 2 while the prime factor of 3 is 3. Therefore, they share no common prime factors. Thus, 4 # 3 gives 0.

So, now you have:

0 + 2

When we add 0 to 2, we clearly just get 2.

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: Let's break down the solution step by step following the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

First, we need to handle what is within Parentheses (PEFMDASC's 'P'):

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we perform Prime Factor Counting (PEFMDASC's 'F'):

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (since prime factors of 2 are 2 and prime factors of 3 are 3, hence, no shared prime factor)

Then, we perform Addition and Subtraction from left to right (PEFMDASC's 'A/S'):

= 6 @ 18 + 11 
= 6 @ 29

Lastly, we perform Concatenation (PEFMDASC's 'C'):

= 629

Therefore, the answer is 629."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: Given the expression 5 + 3 # 2,

Remember our updated order of operations, we calculate # (Prime Factor Counting) before + (addition). The unique prime factor of |3| is 3 and the unique prime factor of |2| is 2. Therefore, since they have no shared prime factors, 3 # 2 = 0.

So, our expression becomes 5 + 0.

Finally, this adds up to 5.

Therefore, the answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 2 @ 4, we need to use the PEFMDASC order of operations. 

According to the new order of operations, we start with parentheses (P). Since this expression has no brackets or parentheses, we can move to exponents (E). Since there are no exponents, we can move on to the next operation.

Following PEFMDASC, the next operation is Prime Factor Counting (F). However, our expression has no ""#"", i.e., no prime factor counting operation.

Next in line are multiplication and division (M/D). There's no multiplication or division in our expression.

So we proceed to addition and subtraction (A/S). Our expression does have '+' operation. We have 5 + 2, which equals 7.

The last operation, and only remaining, is concatenation(C). However, we must understand that according to our order of operations, we had to complete addition before concatenation.

Given the above, our expression now looks like 7 @ 4, which, as per our concatenation operation, would equal 74.

So the answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: Considering the equation 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 and using PEFMDASC order of operations.

(i) The first operation is Prime Factor counting (F).
    8 # 2 = 1 (since both 8 and 2 share the prime factor 2)
    6 # 6 = 1 (since 6 only has the prime factor 2, which it obviously shares with itself)

So, the equation becomes 1 + 1.

(ii) The second operation is Addition (A).
    1 + 1 = 2

So, the answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2, we need to use the PEFMDASC order of operations. 

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
We look for prime factors common to 4 and 3. 

The prime factors of |4| are 2 (2*2) and the prime factors of |3| are 3. There are no common prime factors. So, 4 # 3 = 0.

This simplifies the expression to: 0 + 2

Step 2: Addition (A)
We then add the remaining values: 0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: First, we need to solve the expression within parentheses, but inside this expression ""+"" is lower in the order of operations than ""@"". So, we simplify the expression within parentheses first:

14 + 4 = 18

So, the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we move to the third operation in the acronym, Prime Factor Counting:

2 # 3 = 0

Since 2 and 3 are both primes and they don't have any shared prime factors. Now we've got: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Next in the order of operations are Addition and Subtraction. We should move from left to right:

6 @ 18 + 12 = 6 @ 30.

Then,

6 @ 30 - 0 = 6 @ 30.

Finally, we perform the last operation, Concatenation:

6 @ 30 = 630.

So the final answer to this problem is 630. 

The answer is 630."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 3 # 2, we need to use the PEFMDASC order of operations. According to this, prime factor counting (F) comes before addition (A). So let's break it down:

Step 1: Evaluate 3 # 2, the prime factor counting operation. 

The prime factor of 3 is 3 (since it's a prime number), and the prime factor of 2 is 2 (since it's also a prime number). There are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, hence 3 # 2 = 0.

Step 2: Substitute back into the original expression. The expression now becomes 5 + 0.

Step 3: Evalute 5 + 0 - According to basic maths operation, 5 + 0 is 5.

The answer is 5."
