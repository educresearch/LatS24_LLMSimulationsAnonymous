systemPrompt1_userPrompt2_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: First, we have to identify what 8 # 2 and 6 # 6 equals.

8 # 2 refers to the count of unique prime factors shared by 8 and 2. The only prime factor of 8 is 2, and the only prime factor of 2 is 2 itself. So, 8 # 2 equals 1.

6 # 6 refers to the count of unique prime factors shared by 6 and 6. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since they are compared with the same number, they share all prime factors. So, 6 # 6 equals 2.

Then, according to the order of operations (PEFDMASC), we have to add the numbers gotten from the Prime Factor Counting operation. That is, we add 1 and 2.

systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem we need to follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC):

First, we'll start with Parentheses:
6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Here, ""14+4"" is inside parentheses so we solve this first:
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we have to do Exponents, but there are no exponents in the problem so we move to the next step.

The next operation is Prime Factor counting:
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

Here, ""2 # 3"" translates to the count of unique prime factors shared by 2 and 3. Since 2 and 3 are both primes and they are different, they don't share any prime factors, so the result is 0.

Next, there's Multiplication and Division, but there are none in the problem, so we will skip this step and go for Addition and Subtraction.
= 6 @ 18 + 11

Subtracting ""12 - 1"" results 11.

Finally, the operation is Concatenation:
= 618 + 11
= 629

So, the answer is 629."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

First, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation (denoted as #) because it comes before addition in the order of operations (PEFMDASC). Here, 3 # 2 returns the count of prime factors they share.

The prime factors of 3 are {3} and the prime factors of 2 are {2}. So, they don't have any common prime factors. Hence, 3 # 2 = 0.

So, the operation becomes: 5 + 0.

systemPrompt3_userPrompt3_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: First, we need to understand the prime factors of numbers 4 and 3. The prime factors of 4 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Here we see that these two numbers do not share any common prime factors.

So, if we evaluate the expression 4#3, it will return to us the number of common prime factors, which is 0.

Now, we can continue to the next operation in our statement which is addition, denoted as +. Add the result from 4#3 which is 0 to 2.

That gives us 0 + 2.

Also, notice that we proceed from left to right, according to the updated operation order: PEFMDASC. Hence, Prime Factor Counting (F) comes before Addition (A) in the order of operations.

So doing this operation, our final result becomes 2.

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
The first operation to do according to PEFMDASC is the prime factor counting (F).
So, we have to find the count of unique prime factors shared between 4 and 3.

The prime factors of 4 are [2, 2]. The prime factors of 3 are [3]. 
There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3. So, the result of the prime factor counting operation (4#3) is 0.

So, the expression 4#3 + 2 becomes 0 + 2.

Step 2: Addition (A)
The next operation to do according to PEFMDASC is addition. In our case, it is 0 + 2, which equals 2.

                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Given the expression: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
To solve it, we have to use the updated order of operations PEFMDASC: Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction, and Concatenation. 

Step 1 - Parentheses (P):
Calculate the expression within parentheses first.
14 + 4 = 18

So, the expression becomes: 
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2 - Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, calculate the count of shared prime factors between 2 and 3.
The prime factors of 2 are 2 itself, while that of 3 are 3 itself and there are no shared prime factors. So 2#3=0.

So, the expression becomes: 
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3 - Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Next is the subtraction. Calculate the subtraction 12 - 0 = 12.

So, the expression becomes: 
6 @ 18 + 12

Next is the addition. Calculate 18 + 12 = 30.

So, the expression becomes: 
6 @ 30

Step 4 - Concatenation (C)
Finally, perform the concatenation, where 6 is joined with 30.

6 @ 30 = 630

So, the answer is 630."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

We need to start from the Prime Factor counting (F) operation as it comes first in the PEFMDASC order.

Step 1: Calculate 3 # 2
Prime factors of 3 are 3 and for 2 is 2. So, there are 0 shared unique prime factors present. So, 3 # 2 = 0

Then, we proceed to the Addition operation(A) in PEFMDASC.
