So, we first evaluate 5 + 2 = 7.

So we get 7 @ 4, which means we join 7 and 4 at a digit level, to get 74.

Following the new PEFMDASC order of operations, it is noticeable that prime factor counting (F) comes before addition or subtraction (A), hence the # operation should be done first. 

Now, considering each number's prime factors:
1. Prime factors of 8 = 2
2. Prime factors of 2 = 2
3. Prime factors of 6 = 2 and 3

Therefore, we can rewrite the problem as:
1 * 1 + 2 (since both 8 and 2 share a same prime factor, which is 2. And 6 has two prime factors: 2 and 3, but only 2 is shared with 6 itself)

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (because the only shared prime factor between 2 and 3 is 2)

Next, we proceed to the addition operation:

6 @ 30 - 1

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

Here, 3 # 2 represents the Prime Factor Counting operation. 

Prime factors of |3| are 3, and prime factors of |2| are 2. Since there are no common prime factors between 3 and 2, 3 # 2 = 0.

Here, we have addition and prime factor counting. According to the updated order of operations, prime factor counting should be evaluated before addition.

Prime factor counting # for 3 and 2 is:
Prime factors of 3 are 3. Prime factors of 2 are 2. They do not share any prime factor so 3 # 2 = 0

If we substitute that into the equation we have:

5 + 0 = 5 

The answer is 5."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1.

Here's how we would evaluate the expression:

Given:

5 + 2 @ 4

There are no Parentheses, Exponents, or Prime Factor counts to evaluate first according to the PEFMDASC order of operations.

We come to Addition next. However, since Concatenation has to be performed last, we do not perform Addition here yet.

So, the next operation would be Concatenation:
2 @ 4 = 24

This transforms our expression to:

5 + 24

Now, since there is no Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting, Multiplication and Division left, we move directly to Addition. 

Finally, do the Addition:

5 + 24 = 29

So, the result of ""5 + 2 @ 4"" according to the PEFMDASC order of operations is 29.

Therefore, the answer is 29."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Given expression: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

Step 1 (Parentheses): 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3 
Closely following the revised order of operations (PEFMDASC), the calculation to be performed inside the parentheses comes first. Thus, (14 + 4) is evaluated as 18.

Step 2 (Prime Factor Counting): 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1
Next, the prime factor counting operation (F) comes prior to the other remaining operations. The numbers 2 and 3 have only one common prime factor, 2. Hence, 2#3 results in 1.

Step 3 (Addition): 6 @ 18 + 11
Next, in the remaining operations, addition and subtraction are of the same precedence and performed from left to right. So, we perform 12 - 1 as 11.

Step 4 (Concatenation): 618 + 11
The final operation is concatenation (C), and according to the guiding principle, |6| @ |18| equals 618.

Step 5 (Addition): 629
Lastly, the remaining operation to be performed is the addition of 618 + 11, which results in 629.

The answer is 629."

Here's how we would solve the problem:

Given:

5 + 3 # 2

The operation in the given expression is addition and prime factor counting. According to the PEFMDASC order of operations, we will first calculate the prime factor counting before we perform the addition.

Prime Factor counting (F):

3 # 2 means we have to find the count of unique prime factors shared between 3 and 2. 

The prime factor of 3 is 3 and the prime factor of 2 is 2. 

There are no shared prime factors, so 3 # 2 equals 0.

Now our expression looks like this:

5 + 0

Now we perform addition (A):

5 + 0 = 5

So, the answer is 5."
