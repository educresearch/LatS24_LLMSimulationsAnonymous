2. Exponents
3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
4. Multiplication and Division (L to R)
5. Addition and Subtraction (L to R)
6. Concatenation (C) (L to R)

The given expression is 5 + 2 @ 4.

According to the order of operations, we need to evaluate the addition (5 + 2) before we perform the concatenation (@).

So let's break it down following the rules:

1. Calculate the sum of 5 and 2.
   5 + 2 = 7

2. Perform the concatenation operation (C) with the result and 4.
   7 @ 4 = 74 (because we are just combining the digits)

Therefore, the final answer is 74, and we can present it as requested:

1. \( 8\#2 \) – The unique prime factors of 8 are 2 (since 8 is \( 2^3 \)) and for 2, the prime is 2. Therefore, they share one unique prime factor (which is 2).

Result for the first term: \( 8\#2 = 1 \)

2. \( 6\#6 \) – The unique prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since both numbers are 6, they share all of their prime factors. Therefore, they have two shared prime factors.

systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Let's solve the given problem step by step, following the new PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. Parentheses (P)
2. Exponents (E)
3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
4. Multiplication (M) and Division (D) - from left to right
5. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S) - from left to right
6. Concatenation (C) - from left to right

Given Expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Evaluate Parentheses (P)
We need to address the expression within the parentheses first, which is the addition of 14 and 4.
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: No Exponents (E) to evaluate.

Step 3: Evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F)
Now we must evaluate the prime factor counting operation between 2 and 3.
The prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. They don't share any prime factors, so the result of 2 # 3 is 0.
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: No Multiplication (M) or Division (D) to evaluate.

Step 5: Evaluate Addition (A) and Subtraction (S)
Evaluate the addition of 12 and the subtraction of 0. 
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0
= 6 @ 18 + 12

Step 6: Evaluate Concatenation (C)
Finally, we perform the concatenation operation. Since concatenation will be performed left to right, we first concatenate 6 and 18."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

Since both numbers are the same, they have the same prime factors, which are 2 and 3.
The shared prime factors are 2 and 3, making a total of 2 unique shared prime factors. Therefore, \( 6#6 = 2 \).

Now that we have the results of the prime factor counting:

Given: 4 # 3 + 2

Step 1: Look at the operations present.
We have ""Prime Factor Counting"" (#) and addition (+).

Step 2: Evaluate Prime Factor Counting first (as per the order: PEFMDASC).
When looking at the unique prime factors:
- The prime factors of 4 are 2 * 2 or just 2 (since we're looking for unique factors).
- The prime factors of 3 are just 3.

There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so 4 # 3 = 0.

Step 3: Now we perform the addition with the result from step 2.
0 + 2 = 2

Therefore, the final result of the expression 4 # 3 + 2 is 2.

6@(14+4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Using the updated order of operations, we do the following:

1. Parentheses (P)
Calculate the expression within the parentheses first.

14 + 4 = 18

Now, the expression becomes:

6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Prime Factor Counting (F)
Calculate the prime factor counting next.

The prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. There are no shared prime factors, so:

2 # 3 = 0

Now, the expression becomes:

6@18 + 12 - 0

3. Multiplication/Division (M/D)
There is no multiplication or division to be performed.

4. Addition/Subtraction (A/S)
Now add or subtract from left to right.

6@18 + 12 - 0
First, we do the addition:

18 + 12 = 30

Now our expression is:

6@30 - 0

Since subtraction is part of A/S, we do that next:

30 - 0 = 30

5. Concatenation (C)
Finally, perform the concatenation. Concatenation is performed left to right.

6@30 becomes a concatenation of the digits of 6 and 30.

6@30 = 630

The final answer is:

The answer is 630."

The problem at hand doesn't contain parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, or concatenation, so we'll focus on the remaining operations.

We first perform the prime factor counting operation because it comes before addition:

5 + 3#2

To perform 3#2, we need to count the number of unique prime factors shared by 3 and 2:

- Prime factors of 3 are {3}.
- Prime factors of 2 are {2}.

Since there are no shared prime factors, we have:

3#2 = 0

Now we replace that in the original expression:

5 + 0

Lastly, we perform the addition:

5 + 0 = 5

1. Parentheses (P)
2. Exponents (E)
3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
4. Multiplication (M) and Division (D) (left to right)
5. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S) (left to right)
6. Concatenation (C) (left to right)

In our case, the expression \(5+2 @ 4\) does not have parentheses, exponents, prime factor counting, multiplication, or division. So we apply addition and concatenation.

According to the updated order, addition (A) comes before concatenation (C). Therefore, we first perform the addition of 5 and 2, and then do the concatenation with 4.

Calculating step by step:

\(5+2 = 7\)

Then we concatenate the result with 4:

\(7 @ 4 = 74\)

Thus, the final answer is \(74\).

The answer is 74."

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
For 8 and 2, we find the unique prime factors of each:
- The prime factors of \( 8 \) are \( 2 \times 2 \times 2 \) (or \( 2^3 \)).
- The prime factors of \( 2 \) are simply \( 2 \).

Since \( 2 \) is the common prime factor, we have one unique prime factor in common. So \( 8#2 = 1 \).

For 6 and 6, we again find the unique prime factors of each:
- The prime factors of \( 6 \) are \( 2 \times 3 \).
- The prime factors of \( 6 \) are \( 2 \times 3 \).

Since \( 2 \) and \( 3 \) are the common prime factors, we have two unique prime factors in common. So \( 6#6 = 2 \).

Step 2: Addition
Now we add the results of the prime factor counting:
\( 1 + 2 = 3 \).

Putting it all together, we get a final answer of 3.

6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3

First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:

1. (14 + 4) = 18

Now, the expression simplifies to:

2. 6@18 + 12-2 # 3

Next, we look for any Prime Factor Counting operations:

There are no exponents, so we move to Prime Factor Counting (F). Since we must do prime factorization before addition or subtraction, let's handle the prime factor counting operation (2 # 3):

3. The prime factors of 2 are just 2, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3. They do not share any common prime factors, so 2#3 = 0.

Now the expression is simplified to:

4. 6@18 + 12-0

With no multiplication or division to do next, we move on to addition and subtraction, evaluating from left to right:

5. 6@18 is a concatenation operation, so we merge the digits of 6 and 18, resulting in 618.

Now the expression is:

6. 618 + 12-0

7. 618 + 12 = 630

8. 630 - 0 = 630

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
First, we will address the prime factor counting operation (#) before moving to addition.

For the first part, 8#2:
- The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2.
- The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
Since both numbers have the prime factor 2 in common, 8#2 equals 1 because there is one unique prime factor that they share.

For the second part, 6#6:
- The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
- The prime factors of the other 6 are also 2 and 3.
Since both numbers have the prime factors 2 and 3 in common, 6#6 equals 2 because there are two unique prime factors that they share.

In this expression, we only have Prime Factor Counting and Addition.

Here are the steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): 
   Evaluate \(4 \# 3\). The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2. The prime factors of 3 is 3. There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so \(4 \# 3 = 0\).

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Let's break down the expression step by step, following the PEFMDASC order of operations:

Expression: 6@(14+4) + 12 - 2 # 3

1. Parentheses (P):
First, we'll evaluate the expression inside the parentheses.
(14 + 4) = 18

The expression now looks like this: 
6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Exponents (E):
There are no exponents in our expression, so we move on.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F):
Next, we will do the prime factor counting between 2 and 3.
2's prime factor is 2, and 3's prime factor is 3. There are no shared prime factors, so:
2 # 3 = 0

The expression now looks like this:
6@18 + 12 - 0

4. Multiplication/Division (M/D):
There is no multiplication or division to perform, so we move on.

5. Addition/Subtraction (A/S):
Now, let's perform the addition and subtraction from left to right (because they have the same level of precedence).
We can skip directly to addition because the subtraction part was neutralized by prime factor counting.
12 - 0 = 12

The expression now simplifies to:
6@18 + 12

6. Concatenation (C):
Finally, we perform the concatenation operation. This joins the digits of 6 and 18.
6 @ 18 = 618

Now let's add the result of the concatenation to 12:
618 + 12 = 630

The answer is 630."
