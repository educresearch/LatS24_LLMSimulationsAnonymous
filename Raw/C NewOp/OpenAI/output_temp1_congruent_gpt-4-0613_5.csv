systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,user,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3
systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Applying the new order of operations as per PEFMDASC, we will first deal within the brackets denoted by the parentheses (P):

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3  (since addition comes before concatenation.)

Next, we will handle the concatenation operator '@':

= 618 + 12 - 2 # 3  (since concatenation comes before addition and subtraction.)

Moving on, we perform the addition operation:

= 630 - 2 # 3  (since addition comes before subtraction.)

After that, under the new order of operations, prime factor (F) counting operation is performed before subtraction, but after addition,

= 630 - 1  (since 2 and 3 share only one prime factor, which is 2.)

Finally, we perform the subtraction operation:

= 629

Therefore, the solution to the problem 6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3 under the new order of operations is 629.

So,

The answer is 629."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

According to the new operation PEFMDASC, the Prime Factor Counting (F) is performed before Addition (A), so we need to evaluate 8#2 and 6#6 first.

The prime factors of 8 are 2, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Hence, 8#2 = 1

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and hence 6#6 = 2

So, the expression becomes 1 + 2.

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

Step 1: Calculate Addition
Since addition comes before concatenation in PEFMDASC, we first add 5 and 2.
5 + 2 = 7

Step 2: Perform Concatenation
The next operation is concatenation. We perform 7 @ 4 resulting in '74' because concatenation combines the numbers.
7 @ 4 = 74

So, the answer is 74."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow the steps as below:

Problem: 6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3

Step 1 [Parentheses (P) first]: 
We evaluate the parentheses first, which is (14+4). It gives 18.

6@18 + 12-2  #  3

Step 2 [Prime Factor Counting (F) before Addition/Subtraction (A/S)]:
The Prime Factor Counting operation (F) is indicated using the '#' symbol. In this problem, you have: 2 # 3. The prime factors for 2 are just 2, and for 3 are just 3. According to the definition, this operation counts the common unique prime factors between 2 and 3, which there are none. Therefore 2 # 3 = 0.

6@18 + 12-0

Step 3 [Addition/Subtraction (A/S) before Concatenation (C)]:
Now, we perform the Addition/Subtraction operation. We get:

6@18 + 12 = 6@18 + 12

Step 4 [Concatenation (C) last]: 
Finally we perform the Concatenation operation 6@18, which joins the two numbers ""6"" and ""18"" together.

618 + 12

Step 5 [Do the Addition/Subtraction (A/S)]:
We do the addition:

618 + 12 = 630

So the final answer is:
The answer is 630."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.
