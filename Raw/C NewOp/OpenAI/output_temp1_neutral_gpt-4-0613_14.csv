systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,user,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Given the problem 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3, we have to solve this according to the PEFMDASC rule:

Firstly, we solve everything inside the parentheses (P). In the expression, the parentheses include (14 + 4).
So, the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Second, we solve prime factor counting (F). The expression includes one prime factor counting operation: 2 # 3.
Prime factors of 2 are {2} and prime factors of 3 are {3}. They don't share a common prime factor.
So, the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

The operations left are concatenation, addition, and subtraction. According to PEFMDASC rule, addition and subtraction (A and S) come before concatenation (C). Thus we'll evaluate the addition and subtraction operations:

First, we perform the addition: 18 + 12 = 30.
So, the expression becomes: 6 @ 30 - 0

Next, we perform the subtraction: 30 - 0 = 30.
So, the expression becomes: 6 @ 30

Lastly, we perform the concatenation operation (C). 6 @ 30 results in the two numbers, 6 and 30, joining together at the digit level to form 630.

So, the final answer is 630. 

Final Answer:

The answer is 630."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

Prime factors for 8 are: 2
Prime factors for 2 are: 2
Common prime factor is: 2, so 8 # 2 = 1

Prime factors for 6 are: 2, 3
Common prime factor is: 2, so 6 # 6 = 1 (please note that the second '6' in '6 # 6' does not mean 'six', but it means the six which was the result of the prime factor count for the first '6', and has only 2 as prime factor)

Finally, we can now add both results according to the order of operations PEFMDASC.

Therefore, the answer to the problem is 2.

In the string, we have prime factor counting (represented by #) and addition. According to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we work out the prime factor counting first before doing the addition.

Let's see the prime factors of 4 and 3:

- The prime factors of 4 are 2 (twice).
- The prime factor of 3 is 3.

Since there are no common prime factors between 4 and 3, the result of 4 # 3 is 0.

So, our string now becomes 0 + 2.

Although it may seem logical to do concatenation first, the correct order of operations allows you to solve the other parts of the sum first following the rule of PEFMDASC. 

So, let's start:

Step 1: Solve parentheses first, (14 + 4 = 18). The problem now is: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3
Step 2: Then comes E, there are no exponents in this problem, we can skip this.
Step 3: Prime Factor Counting, 2 # 3 which is 0 (since there are no common prime factors between 2 and 3). The problem now is: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0
Step 4: Multiplication and Division, there are no multiplication and division operations in the problem.
Step 5: Addition and Subtraction now, starting from the left to right, we can do the addition first (18 + 12 = 30) then subtraction (30 - 0 = 30). The problem now is: 6 @ 30
Step 6: Concatenation as final step, 6 @ 30 = 630

In the operation 3 # 2, we find the prime factors of 3 and 2.
Prime factor of 3 is 3 itself.
Prime factor of 2 is 2 itself.
So, the result of 3 # 2 is 0, as there are no common prime factors.

Now, substitute this result back into the original problem:
5 + 0 = 5.

So the answer to 5 + 3 # 2 is 5. As required, writing the final answer in the prescribed format:

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:

Here are the steps to solve the given expression:

Step 1: Addition (A)
Perform the addition operation which comes before the Concatenation (C) operation in the PEFMDASC order.
So, 5 + 2 = 7. 

Step 2: Concatenation (C)
Now concatenate 7 (result from step 1) with 4.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC (Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division (left to right), Addition and Subtraction (left to right), Concatenation (left to right)), let's solve the given problem step by step.

Expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses '()': Our expression inside the parentheses is (14 + 4). Adding these gives us 18.

So, the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting '#': Identify the prime factors of 2 and 3. 2 has only one prime factor which is itself, 2. 3 also has only one prime factor which is itself, 3. They do not share any common prime factors. So, 2 # 3 is 0.

The expression now becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3: Addition '+' and Subtraction '-': Proceed from left to right. 
First, we perform concatenation operation. 6 @ 18 results in 618.

The expression becomes: 618 + 12 - 0
Next, add 618 + 12 to get 630. 

The expression becomes: 630 - 0
Then, subtract 0 from 630 to get 630.

So, the final answer is 630. 

The answer is 630."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

According to PEFMDASC, Prime Factor counting (F) is done before Addition (A) and Subtraction (S). Therefore, we need to calculate 3 # 2 before adding it to 5.

Let's evaluate 3 # 2:

The prime factor of 3 is 3, and prime factor of 2 is 2. Therefore, the operation 3 # 2 yields 0 because there are no shared prime factors.

So, the expression 5 + 3 # 2 simplifies to 5 + 0.

The answer is 5."
