Given the Mathematics problem: 
5 + 2 @ 4, 

We should first perform the addition operation since it comes before concatenation in the order of operations. 

So, 5 + 2 = 7. 

This gives us 7 @ 4.

Then, we perform the concatenation operation, which gives:

7 @ 4 = 74.

So, the final answer is 74.

So, we have to find the prime factors of numbers involved in the '#' operation before we can do the addition:

(i) The prime factor of |8| = 2 
    And the prime factor of |2| = 2
    Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1, as there is one prime factor common between 8 and 2, which is 2.

(ii) The prime factor of |6| = 2 and 3
     The prime factor of |6| = 2 and 3
     Therefore, 6 # 6 = 2, as there are 2 prime factors common between 6 and 6, which are 2 and 3.

Step 1: Calculate within parentheses 
= 6 @ (18) + 12 - 2#3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: Apply Prime Factor Counting (F). Since 2 and 3 both have only one prime factor (2 and 3 respectively), and they are not shared, 2#3 = 0
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0
= 6 @ 18 + 12

Step 3: Next, handle addition and subtraction from left to right:

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

systemPrompt3_userPrompt2_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this equation, we need to follow the updated order of operations, PEFMDASC: Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction, and Concatenation.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Apply the prime factor counting operation:
8 # 2 = 1 (since 2 is the only prime factor of 8 and 2).
6 # 6 = 1 (since 2 and 3 are the prime factors of 6, and there's one shared prime factor, so it's 1).

So, 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 1 = 2.

Hence, based on the newly updated order of operations, the final answer is 2. 

So, the answer is 2."

We start by evaluating the # operation. Here, we need to calculate the number of unique prime factors common to |3| and |2|. 

The only prime factor of 2 is 2. The only prime factor of 3 is 3. There are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3, hence 3 # 2 = 0.

Follow this by adding this result to 5.

So, 5+3 # 2 = 5 + 0 = 5.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression, we should use the PEFMDASC order of operations: Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction, and Concatenation. 

Let's solve it step by step:

Step 1: Parentheses

6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

Here, within the parentheses, we perform the operation of addition:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: Prime Factor counting

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Here, we find the count of unique prime factors shared by 2 and 3. The prime factor of 2 and 3 are themselves and they do not share any, so the result is 0:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction

Now, perform the addition:

6 @ 18 + 12

Becomes:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Which equals:

6 @ 30

After that, perform the subtraction:

6 @ 30

Step 4: Concatenation

Finally, perform the concatenation operation:

6 @ 30

Becomes:

630

The answer is 630."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

Firstly, let's calculate the prime factors of the absolute values of 3 and 2.
=> The prime factor of 3 is 3 and that of 2 is 2. 

This means they do not share any prime factors, so 3 # 2 = 0.

Performing the addition, we get 5.
