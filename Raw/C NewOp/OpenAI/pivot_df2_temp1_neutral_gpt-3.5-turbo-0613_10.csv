gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we follow the order of operations as outlined in PEFMDASC:

1. Prime Factor counting (F)
   - The prime factors of 4 are 2.
   - The prime factors of 3 are 3.
   - The shared prime factors between 4 and 3 is 0.
   - Therefore, 4 # 3 = 0.

2. Addition (A)
   - 0 + 2 = 2.

So, the final answer is 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: First, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation. The absolute value of 4 is 4, and the absolute value of 3 is 3. The prime factors of 4 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. There is no shared prime factor between 4 and 3, so the result of 4 # 3 is 0.

Next, we move to the addition (A/S) operation. We have 0 + 2, which equals 2.

Therefore, the final answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the updated order of operations, we follow the steps below:

1. Prime factor counting (F):
   a = 4: Prime factors of 4 are 2.
   b = 3: Prime factors of 3 are 3.
   The shared prime factor between 4 and 3 is 2 (there is one shared prime factor).
   Therefore, 4 # 3 = 1.

2. Addition (A):
   1 + 2 = 3.

Therefore, the final answer is 3.
