gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: According to the new order of operations, addition and concatenation would be evaluated in the order of they appear, that is left to right. 

Hence, the solution to the mathematics problem given would be:
It means we have to add 5 to the concatenation of 2 and 4. 

First, we perform the concatenation operation, 2 @ 4, because it is in a parentheses.
So, 2 @ 4 = 24

Then we add the 5.
So final calculation: 5 + 24 = 29

Therefore, the answer is 29."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: For this problem, we first need to evaluate the prime factor counting operations, as they come before addition according to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC). 

The prime factors of 8 are 2 (since 8 = 2^3), and the prime factors of 2 are just 2 itself. Thus, 8 # 2 = 1 because they share the prime factor 2.

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, so 6 # 6 = 2 because 6 shares both prime factors (2 and 3) with itself.

Putting this all together, our calculation becomes 1 + 2 = 3.

So, the answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: Firstly, the prime factors of 4 are 2 while for 3 the prime factor is 3. They don't share any common prime factors, so 4#3 equals 0. Given this, we have:

0 + 2

Evaluating this easy sum gives us 2. So,

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Let's follow the order of operations as defined by PEFMDASC. 

We are given: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

Step 1: Resolve parentheses first: 

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: Next, prime factor counting because there is no exponentiation:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (since prime factors of 2 are 2 and prime factors of 3 are 3, i.e., no shared prime factors, thus 0.)

Step 3: Addition and subtraction come next:

24 - 0 = 24

Step 4: Finally, the concatenation:

6 @ 24 = 624

So, the final result of the given calculation is 624.

The answer is 624."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: Firstly, the Prime Factor Counting operation (#) is conducted.

The prime factor of 3 is 3. The prime factor of 2 is 2. There are no shared factors. So 3 # 2 = 0.

The equation then becomes 5 + 0.

Finally, the standard arithmetic rules of Addition is performed, where 5 + 0 equals 5.

So the answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: Based on the new operations and updated order, we should evaluate the concatenation (C) operation last and addition (A) operation before that. 

Hence, for the given problem 5 + 2@4, we would execute addition first and then concatenation. 

Hence, it will be:

= 7@4 (since we need to evaluate addition before concatenation)
= 74 (since 7 concatenated with 4 gives 74)

So, the final answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: First, we apply the operation of Prime Factor Counting (F) based on the new order of operations. This leads us to evaluate the first part as 8 # 2 and the second part as 6 # 6. 

The prime factors of |8| are 2 while those of |2| are 2 as well, hence they have one unique prime factor in common which is 2. So, 8 # 2 = 1.

6 has the prime factors 2 and 3. So, 6 # 6 also equals to 1, as we are considering the shared prime numbers in the same number, which are 2 and 3.

So the expression now simplifies to : 1 + 1.

Performing the addition gives us 2.

So, the answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: The given problem is 4 # 3 + 2. 

Here, we first calculate the operation mentioned by #. This operation is 'Prime Factor counting'. The prime factor of 4 is 2 and prime factor of 3 is 3. They don't have any common prime factor. So, 4 # 3 equals 0.

Step 3: Solve Addition:
6 @ 30 - 1

Step 4: Solve Subtraction:
6 @ 29

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: In the problem 5+3 # 2, we apply the revised order of operations, PEFMDASC.

First, Prime Factor Counting (F) comes before addition (A). 
The prime factors of 3 are [3] and those of 2 are [2]. Hence they do not share any prime factor.
Therefore, 3 # 2 = 0.

Now, the problem becomes 5 + 0.

Lastly, we execute addition operation.

We are left with 5.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, let's apply the new order of operations, PEFMDASC, to solve this problem.

The operation in this case is Prime Factor Counting (denoted as #), followed by addition (+). According to the updated order of operations, Prime Factor Counting (F) is performed before Addition (A). 

4#3 means we're looking for the count of unique prime factors common to 4 and 3. The prime factors of 4 are 2 (2*2), and the prime factor of 3 is 3, so there are no prime factors shared between 4 and 3. Hence, 4#3 equals 0.

Applying this result to the equation, we now have 0 + 2.

Conclusion:
The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Given, 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

Breaking this down according to the updated order of operations, we perform parentheses operation first:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Since ""Prime Factor Counting"" comes before ""addition and subtraction"" and ""Concatenation"" in the order of operations. So let's deal with that: 2#3 implies we have to find the common unique prime factors for 2 and 3.

But 2 and 3 are both prime numbers and they do not have any common prime factor. Hence, 2#3 is equal to 0. 

So, our equation becomes:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Now we proceed further with the equation from left to right, performing the operations of addition and subtraction, and finally the concatenation operation:

6@18 is performed last since concatenation is the last operation in the updated order of operation. Before that, we do the addition operation:

18 + 12 equals 30.

Subtracting 0 from 30 yields 30:

30 - 0 equals 30.

Now we perform the concatenation:

6 @ 30 gives us 630.

Following the order of operations, the solution to 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3 is 630.

So, ""The answer is 630."""
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: First, let's apply the new order of operations, PEFMDASC, to solve this problem.

The operation here involves Prime Factor Counting (#) which is denoted as F in the order of operations, and Addition (+) which is represented as A.

According to the new order of operations, Prime Factor Counting comes before Addition. So, we need to solve the Prime Factor Counting operation first.

Given:
a = 3 and b = 2 in the operation a # b.

Prime factors of 3 include only 3 (since 3 is a prime number itself).
Prime factors of 2 include only 2 (since 2 is a prime number itself).

Therefore, a # b = 3 # 2 = 0 (since there are no shared prime factors).

Next, we proceed to the addition operation:

5 + 0 = 5

So, the final answer for the given mathematical problem ""5+3 # 2"" based on the newly updated order of operations is 5.

The answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve the expression ""5 + 2 @ 4"" following the PEFMDASC order of operations rules, we first deal with any Parentheses (P), Exponents (E), Prime Factor Counting (F), Multiplication and Division (M/D), and Addition and Subtraction (A/S). Here, we have an Addition operation ""5 + 2"" and a Concatenation operation ""2 @ 4"".

Addition comes first in the PEFMDASC order:

5 + 2 = 7

Next, we continue with the Concatenation operation which comes last in the PEFMDASC order of operations. But since the addition operation has consumed the original '2', we will replace the '2' in ""2 @ 4"" with the result of the Addition operation that we just calculated above:

7 @ 4 = 74

So, following the PEFMDASC order of operations, the final result of ""5 + 2 @ 4"" is 74. 

The answer is 74."

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the expression ""4#3 + 2"" using the PEFMDASC order, follow these steps:

Step 1: Check the number of unique positive factors shared by 4 and 3. This solves for ""4#3"". 

The prime factor of 4 is 2.
The prime factor of 3 is 3.
As they do not share a common factor, the result of ""4#3"" is 0.

So, the expression now becomes ""0 + 2"".

Step 2: Solve for ""0 + 2"". 

Operation used here is addition which states that we add the numbers together.

So 0 added to 2 equals 2.
