gpt-4-0613,1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, we evaluate the prime factor count (4 # 3). The prime factors of 4 are 2 (2*2) and the prime factors of 3 are just 3. 

Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, therefore, 4 # 3 = 0.

Now the problem becomes 0 + 2. The order of operations tells us to do addition next. Therefore, 0 + 2 = 2. 

So, the answer is 2.","GPT Response: Given the problem, we evaluate the operation according to the revised order of operations (PEFMDASC):

4 # 3 + 2

= 0 + 2 (since prime factors of 4 are 2 and there are no prime factors for 3, and hence there are 0 shared prime factors and prime factor counting is evaluated before addition according to revised order of operations)

= 2 (since addition comes after prime factor counting in the order of operations)

Therefore, the answer is 2.","GPT Response: Let's solve this problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC).

The expression is 4 # 3 + 2.

First, apply the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation. The prime factor of 4 is 2, and the prime factor for 3 is 3. Hence, they don't share any common prime factors.

So, 4 # 3 = 0.

This simplifies the expression to: 0 + 2.

Finally, perform the addition (A):

0 + 2 = 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: The given expression is 4 # 3 + 2. 

According to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to evaluate Prime Factor counting (F) before Addition (A), so consider the expression '4 # 3' first.

For 4 # 3: the prime factor of number 4 is 2, and the prime factor for 3 is 3. As there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, 4 # 3 = 0.

So, the given expression becomes 0 + 2.

Following the order of operations, the next operation we perform is Addition (A).

Therefore, 0 + 2 = 2.

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: In this problem we have two operations, addition (+) and concatenation (@) with order of operations being as follows - Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication or Division, Addition or Subtraction, Concatenation (PEFMDASC).

From the order of operations, we see that Addition should be done prior to performing concatenation operation. 

Hence, we first perform the addition operation:

5 + 2 = 7

Then, performing concatenation operation:

7 @ 4 = 74

So, the answer is 74.","GPT Response: According to the new order of operations, addition and subtraction must be evaluated before concatenation. 

Firstly, we must perform the addition operation of ""5 + 2"", which gives us 7. 

Then, we will perform the concatenation operation of ""7 @ 4"", which gives us 74.

Hence, the solution to the given problem:
5 + 2 @ 4 equals 74.

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: Let's solve this problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC).

The expression you provided is: 5 + 2 @ 4

Following the order:

P: There are no Parentheses.

E: There are no Exponents.

F: There's no Prime Factor Counting.

M/D: There's no Multiplication or Division.

A/S: We have addition but we'll solve this after the concatenation as per the new order.

C: Concatenation is present: 2 @ 4 = 24
So, the equation becomes: 5 + 24

A/S: After resolving concatenation, we can perform the addition: 5 + 24 = 29

So, the final answer is 29.","GPT Response: Following the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), addition (5 + 2) is calculated before concatenation (2 @ 4). 

Step 1: Addition
5 + 2 = 7

Step 2: Concatenation
With a now as 7 and b as 4, we can implement concatenation as 7 @ 4 = 74.

gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: First, we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operation (F) according to PEFMDASC.

The prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. 

There are zero shared prime factors therefore, 3 # 2 = 0.

The operation then becomes, 5 + 0. 

Finally, we evaluate the addition remaining to get the answer.

So, the answer is 5.","GPT Response: According to the new order of operations, Prime Factor counting (F) is carried out before Addition (A). 

First, we calculate 3 # 2. The prime factor of 3 is 3 and the prime factor of 2 is 2. Since they do not share any prime factors, 3 # 2 equals 0.

So the problem simplifies to:

5 + 0

Which equals 5.

So, the final answer is ""The answer is 5.""","GPT Response: Let's solve this problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC).

The new operation here is Prime Factor Counting. Prime Factor Counting (F) is denoted as a # b, and it counts the unique prime factors common to |a| and |b|.

First, let's calculate the Prime Factor Count of 3 and 2 (3 # 2):

Prime factors of 3 are 3 (because 3 itself is prime)
Prime factors of 2 are 2 (because 2 is prime)
Since there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, the count will be 0.

So, 3 # 2 = 0

Now the original problem, 5 + 3 # 2, is simplified to 5 + 0.

We proceed with the addition operation (A), summing 5 + 0 to get 5.

So, the answer to the problem 5 + 3 # 2 is 5.

""The answer is 5.""","GPT Response: Following the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we handle # before +.

Step 1: We'll first evaluate 3 # 2 (Prime Factor Counting). The prime factors of 2 are just '2' and for 3, it's '3'. Hence, the common prime factors number is 0.

So, 3 # 2 = 0.

Step 2: We then compute 5 + 0 which is 5.

gpt-4-0613,1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: We will start by performing the operations in the parentheses

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we will do the prime factorization

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (since prime factors of 2 are 2 and prime factors of 3 is 3, hence they share 0 prime factors)

Now, we perform the addition since FMDAS is left

6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

The answer is 629.","GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations - PEFMDASC (Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction, Concatenation), let's solve the given problem: 

Problem: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

1st Step [PEFMDASC: Parentheses]: Evaluate the operation in the parentheses first:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2nd Step [PEFMDASC: Prime Factor Counting]: Evaluate the prime factor counting operation:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 1  (Prime factors of 2 are [2] and prime factors of 3 are [3] and they don't share any prime number, therefore, 2 # 3 equals 0)

3rd Step [PEFMDASC: Addition/Subtraction]: Evaluate the addition and subtraction from left to right:

6 @ 30 - 1

= 6 @ 29

4th Step [PEFMDASC: Concatenation]: Evaluate the concatenation operation:

629

The answer is 629.","GPT Response: In the given problem, we have the equation 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3. We will solve this step-by-step following the PEFMDASC order.

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
We first deal with the parentheses and calculate the value of the expression inside parentheses. 
(14 + 4) = 18

So, the equation becomes: 
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents in the problem, so we can skip this step.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we perform the counting of shared prime factors between 2 and 3. 
The prime factors of 2 is 2, and the prime factors of 3 is 3. As 2 and 3 are both prime numbers, they don't share any prime factors. 

So, 2 # 3 = 0

Our equation now is: 
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
There are no multiplication or division operations in this problem, so we can skip this step.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
We perform addition and subtraction from left to right.

So, first, we calculate: 
18 + 12 = 30

The equation now becomes: 
6 @ 30 - 0

Next, subtracting 0 from 30 does not affect the number, hence we ignore it. So, the equation now is: 
6 @ 30

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
The final operation left is the concatenation operation (@): 

6 @ 30 = 630

So, the final answer is: 630. 

The answer is 630."
gpt-4-0613,1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the PEFMDASC order of operations

Step 1:
Calculate the Prime Factor counting operation (F):
8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Prime factors of 8 are 2. Prime factors of 2 are 2. So, 8 # 2 = 1.
Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. So, 6 # 6 = 2.

That would give:
1 + 2

Step 2:
Perform the Addition operation (A):
1 + 2
= 3.

Final answer:
The answer is 3.","GPT Response: According to the PEFMDASC Order of Operations, you need to calculate Prime Factor Counting (F) before performing Addition (A).

For 8 # 2, both 8 and 2 only have one prime factor, which is 2. Therefore, 8 # 2 equals 1.

For 6 # 6, the number 6 has two prime factors, which are 2 and 3. As both numbers are the same, they share all prime factors. However, since there are only 2 unique prime factors, 6 # 6 equals 2.

Now that we've carried out the Prime Factor Counting, we can proceed with performing Addition.

So,

8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 2 = 3.

Therefore, the final answer to the problem is 3. 

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: First, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F), as it is higher in the order of operations PEFMDASC than addition.

When it comes to prime factor counting (F), which is denoted as a # b, we are required to count the unique prime factors that the numbers |a| and |b| share.

(a) 8 # 2 = 1. Prime factors of 8 are 2 alone (2 cubed) and prime factor of 2 is 2, thus we have 1 shared prime factor.

(b) 6 # 6 = 1. For 6 we have prime factors 2 and 3, but both 6 share the same prime factors, in this case we have 2 shared prime factors, but we consider ULTIMATE FACTORS only, i.e., we count the prime factors that both numbers share, counting each prime factor only once. Here, the prime factors 2 and 3 are counted as 1.

Upon evaluating these expressions, we get:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6 
= 1 + 1 
= 2

Therefore, the answer is 2.","GPT Response: For the given problem, we will use the PEFMDASC order of operations. The order gives F for Prime Factor Counting higher priority over A for Addition. 

Given expression: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

First, let's find out the result for the prime factor counting operations:
8 # 2 and 6 # 6

Prime factors for 8: 2
Prime factors for 2: 2
Prime factors for 6: 2, 3

Since 8 and 2 have same prime factor 2, 8 # 2 = 1 (One common prime number)
Since 6's prime factors are 2 and 3, and as it is the same number we are just counting the unique prime factors of 6 = 2, 3, thus 6 # 6 = 2 (Two unique prime numbers)

So, substituting these values into the expression, we get:

1 + 2

Now we carry out the addition:

= 3

So, the answer to the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the PEFMDASC order of operations is 3.

The answer is 3."
