First, let's find the unique prime factors of 4 and 3:
- Prime factors of 4: 2
- Prime factors of 3: 3

Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, the prime factor count is 0.

Now we can perform the addition:
4 # 3 + 2 = 0 + 2 = 2

Therefore, the final answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the new order of operations. 

Step 1: Perform the prime factor counting operation.
4 # 3 = 2 (since 4 has prime factors 2 and 3, and 3 has prime factors 3, so there is one shared prime factor)

There are no exponents in the expression, so we move on to the next step.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting
There are no prime factor counting operations in the expression, so we move on to the next step.

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (Left to Right)
There are no multiplication or division operations in the expression, so we move on to the next step.

Finally, we have 7 @ 4 = 74

Therefore, the answer is 74.","GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations, which is PEFMDASC.

Since there are no parentheses or exponents in the expression, we move to the F step, which is prime factor counting. Here, we have 5 + 2 @ 4. Prime factor counting does not apply to addition, so we skip this step.

Next, we move to the M/D step, which is multiplication and division from left to right. In our expression, we don't have any multiplication or division, so we move to the A/S step, which is addition and subtraction from left to right.

Now, we have 5 + 2 @ 4. We add 5 and 2 first, which gives us 7. Then, we have 7 @ 4. Here, we have concatenation, denoted by the @ symbol. To concatenate, we simply append the digits together, so 7 @ 4 becomes 74.

1. First, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we move on to prime factor counting.
2. We have 5 and 2@4. We need to evaluate the prime factor counting before addition.
   Since 2@4 can be written as 24, there are no prime factors common to 5 and 24.
   Therefore, 5#2@4 = 0.
3. After prime factor counting, we move on to multiplication and division.
   There are no multiplication or division operations in this expression.
4. Next, we perform addition and subtraction.
   5 + 0 = 5.
5. Lastly, we move on to concatenation.
   Since there are no other numbers to concatenate with 5, we keep it as it is.
