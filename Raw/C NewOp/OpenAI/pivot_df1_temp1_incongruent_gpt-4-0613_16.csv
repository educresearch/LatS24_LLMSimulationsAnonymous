gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the problem, the new operation order introduced as PEFMDASC is to be followed. According to this order, prime factor counting (#) is prioritized over addition (+). Here's how to solve:

The expression is 8 # 2+6 # 6

Determining the shared prime factors for each pair of numbers involved with # operation:

(1) 8 # 2: Both 8 and 2 share the prime factor 2, so 8 # 2 = 1.

(2) 6 # 6: Both numbers are 6, so they definitely share their prime factors. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, so 6 # 6 = 2 (since there are two unique shared prime factors)

The expression now becomes 1 + 2. 

Adding those numbers gives 3.

Therefore, the answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve 4 # 3 + 2 using the new operations and order of operations, we should first deal with the prime factor counting operation (F). The primary factor of 4 is 2 while that of 3 is 3, so there are no common factors, meaning the prime factor counting operation 4 # 3 equals to 0.

Then the equation becomes 0 + 2

Finally, the addition (A) operation is performed.

So the final answer is 2.

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC closely. 

Here's the primary problem: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2#3.

Step 1 (Parentheses - P): We first deal with the parentheses, which only deal with the conventional operations. 
14 + 4 = 18
So the problem simplifies to: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3.

Step 2 (Prime Factor counting - F): Next we count the unique prime factors shared by |2| and |3|. 
Unique prime factors of 2 = {2}
Unique prime factors of 3 = {3}
These two sets share no common factors, so the result is 0. 
Now we have: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0.

Step 3 (Addition and Subtraction - AS): Now we perform addition and subtraction from left to right. 
First, 18 + 12 = 30, and then 30 - 0 = 30. So, the problem simplifies to: 6 @ 30.

Step 4 (Concatenation - C): Finally, we perform the concatenation operation, which simply joins the numbers at a digit level, to get 630.

So, the solution of the original problem 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2#3 is 630.

The answer is 630."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve 5+3 # 2 using the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we first have to perform the prime factor counting operation (#). The primary factor of 3 is itself i.e., 3 and for 2, it is 2 itself. Their shared unique prime factors are 0.

Hence 3 # 2 = 0

The given math problem becomes 5 + 0 = 5 

So the final answer is 5.

So, 5 + 2@4 = 74.

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: Using our new rules of order, we evaluate # before +. 

In 8 # 2, the number 8 has the prime factors 2, while the number 2 has the prime factor 2. They share one prime factor.

In 6 # 6, the number 6 has the prime factors 2 and 3. Since we are comparing the same number, all prime factors are shared. However, the number 6 only has 2 unique prime factors.

Now our equation looks like: 1 + 2

Adding these together, we get 3.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC).

Our given problem is 4#3 + 2. 

First, according to the order of operation, Prime Factor counting (F) comes before addition (A). So we need to evaluate 4#3 first.

Prime factors of 4: 2; prime factors of 3: 3. Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, 4#3 equals to 0. 

Substitute that into the equation, we get: 0 + 2.

Then, we progress with the addition operation to get 2.

So, the answer to our problem 4#3 + 2 is 2.

Therefore, The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: First, evaluate the operation in parentheses because P (Parentheses) is the first step: 

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 

Second, perform the 'F' (Prime Factor Counting) operation:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 
= 6 @ 18 + 11 

Next, perform the 'C' Concatenation operation, which is performed after Addition and Subtraction:

= 618 + 11

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the problem ""4#3 + 2"" using the PEFMDASC order, we proceed as follows:

Step 1: deal with the Prime Factor counting (F)
4#3 is the count of unique prime factors that absolute values of 4 and 3 share.
The prime factors of 4 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. 
There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3.
Therefore, 4#3 = 0.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Let's progress step by step by following PEFMDASC order:

1. Parentheses step:
We have the parentheses (14+4) which must be evaluated first according to the PEFMDASC.

    6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
  = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3
    
2. Factor Counting step:
Now evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation:
The prime factors of 2 are 2 only, and the prime factors of 3 are 3 only. Hence, they don't have any common prime factors.

    6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3
  = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

3. Addition/Subtraction step:
Before we proceed to the concatenation, we need to evaluate the addition operation. Subtraction also comes under this order step but we don't have any subtraction operation in the remaining expression. 

    6 @ 18 + 12 - 0
  = 6 @ 30 - 0
  = 6 @ 30 

4. Concatenation step:
Finally, the concatenation operation (C) yields:

    6 @ 30
  = 630

So, after all these steps, we find that 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3 = 630. Therefore,
