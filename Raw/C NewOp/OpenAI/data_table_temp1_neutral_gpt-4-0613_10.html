The only prime factor for 4 is 2 and the only prime factor for 3 is 3. The operation 4 # 3 therefore equals 0 as there are no shared unique prime factors. <br><br>Next, we add this result to 2.

Therefore, they share no common prime factors. Thus, 4 # 3 gives 0.<br><br>So, now you have:<br><br>0 + 2<br><br>When we add 0 to 2, we clearly just get 2.<br><br>The answer is 2.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 2 @ 4, we need to use the PEFMDASC order of operations. <br><br>According to the new order of operations, we start with parentheses (P). Since this expression has no brackets or parentheses, we can move to exponents (E).
