gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: In this problem, we have two operations: prime factor counting (#) and addition (+). According to our order of operations, PEFMDASC, we need to evaluate prime factor counting before addition.

Here are the steps:

1. Evaluate prime factor counting:

Prime factors of 8 are 2, while prime factors of 2 are also 2. So, 8 # 2 = 1 because they share one prime factor which is 2.

Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. So, 6 # 6 = 2 because in this case the two numbers are the same and they share all the prime factors which are 2 and 3.

So our equation now becomes 1 + 2.

2. Evaluate addition:

1 + 2 = 3.

So, based on the problem and the newly updated order of operations, the answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 4#3 + 2 using the new operation rules, you need to apply the Prime Factor Counting operation (#) first before addition. 

The prime factors of 4 are only 2 multiplying by itself. The prime factor of 3 is 3 itself. So, 4 and 3 have no shared prime factor. 

Therefore, 4#3 equals 0.

Now replace 4#3 by 0 in the problem. The new equation becomes: 0 + 2. This is simple addition, and the answer is 2. 

So, The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: First, we can replace @ and # with their respective operations:

6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Going by the new order of operations, PEFMDASC, we must perform parentheses first, then exponents (none present in this case), then prime factor counting, then multiplication and division (not in the problem), and then addition and subtraction, lastly this new operator of concatenation.

Prime factor counting operation:

2 # 3 = The prime factors of 2 are 2. 
The prime factors of 3 are 3. 
They do not share any prime factors.
So, 2 # 3 equals 0.

So, now our equation is:

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 
= 6 @ 18 + 12

Addition:

= 6 @ 30

The concatenation operation:

6 @ 30 = 630. Concatenation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.

The final answer is 630."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve the problem given the new operations and their order of operations, we following steps:

Step 1: First take a look at the operation primes factor counting (F) since it is before the addition operation (A) in the order of operations (PEFMDASC), and we have 3 # 2.

The prime factor of 3 is 3 and the prime factor of 2 is 2 (since they are both prime numbers), so they do not share any prime factor. Therefore, 3 # 2 is 0.

Step 2: Then, we take a look at the operation of addition (A), and we have 5 + 0. Thus, the result is 5.

So, the final answer of the mathematical problem ""5 + 3 # 2"" is 5.

8 # 2 = 1 (since the only prime factor of 8 is 2, which is also a prime factor of 2)
6 # 6 = 1 (since the only prime factor of 6 is 2, which is also a prime factor of 6)

So, the expression becomes: 

1 + 1 

Lastly, we perform the addition:

1 + 1 = 2

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: First, we need to perform the Prime Factor Counting operation as it comes before the addition operation in the updated order of operations PEFMDASC.

The prime factor of 3 is 3 and prime factor of 2 is 2. Therefore, they do not have common prime factors.

So, 3 # 2 = 0

Now, we replace 3 # 2 with 0 in the problem:

5 + 0 = 5

So, the final answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: Here's how you can solve this problem:

Step 1: Remember, the updated order of operations, PEFMDASC, suggests that addition (A) comes before concatenation (C). So, let's calculate the addition operation first.

5 + 2 = 7

Step 2: Now this addition's result needs to be concatenated with 4:

7 @ 4

Step 3: The '@' operation means concatenating the numbers on either side. Thus:

7 @ 4 = 74

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: Let's solve this problem step by step using the new order of operations, PEFMDASC.

The expression we have is: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

The first operation comes under F, which is prime factor counting. So we first evaluate 8 # 2 and 6 # 6:

Prime factors of 8: 2
Prime factors of 2: 2
8 and 2 share 1 prime factor. So, 8 # 2 = 1

Prime factors of 6: 2, 3
Prime factors of 6 (again): 2, 3
6 and 6 share two prime factors (2 and 3), so, 6 # 6 = 2

The expression now becomes: 1 + 2

The next operation is A, which is addition:

1+2 = 3

So the final answer is 3. 

So, the answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the given math problem according to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC):

Initial Expression: 

4 # 3 + 2

Step 1: (Prime Factor Counting - F) 

Evaluate the prime factor count (4 # 3): 

Prime factors of 4 are 2 and prime factors of 3 are 3. Since there are no shared prime factors, 4 # 3 = 0. 

So, the equation now becomes:

0 + 2

Step 2: (Addition - A)

Now, perform the addition operation:

0 + 2 = 2

The final answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Let us solve the equation 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3 step by step using PEFMDASC order of operations (Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction, Concatenation). 

Step 1: Parentheses - We first solve for the operation inside the parentheses, which is 14+4. The sum is 18.
So, the equation now becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting - Now we perform the prime factor counting operation between the absolute values of 2 and 3. The absolute value of 2 is 2 (having prime factors 2) and the absolute value of 3 is 3 (having prime factors 3). As there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3, the result of the operation 2#3 is 0.
So, the equation becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction - Moving from left to right, we first calculate the addition operation of 18 + 12 which equals to 30. Then we subtract 0 from 30 which remains 30.
Hence, the equation now is: 6 @ 30

Step 4: Concatenation - Finally, apply the concatenation operation. We simply join the digits of 6 and 30 as per the concatenation operation.
This leads us to the final answer: 630. 

The answer is 630."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: Here's how you can solve this:

Step 1: Using the new order of operations PEFMDASC, the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation comes before Addition (A). So, we will first calculate 3 # 2.

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting for 3 and 2. The prime factors for 3 are just 3 and for 2 is 2. So there are no shared prime factors. Hence, 3 # 2 = 0.

Step 3: Now, we substitute the result of step 2 into the original expression: 5 + 0.

Step 4: Finally, perform the addition: 5 + 0 = 5.

So, the expression 5+3 # 2=5. Conclusion: The answer is 5."
