Step 1: Perform the Prime Factor Counting operation
The prime factors of 4 are 2 (since 4 = 2*2), and the prime factor of 3 is 3. Since there are no shared prime factors, 4 # 3 = 0.

So, we replace 4 # 3 with 0 in the problem:
The problem now is 0 + 2.

Step 2: Perform the Addition operation
Next, we add 0 and 2 to get 2.

So, the answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we will follow the updated order of operations, PEFMDASC.

Firstly, we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operation.
Prime factors of 4 are 2, and of 3 are 3. Since they do not share any prime factors, 4#3 = 0.

So the equation becomes: 0 + 2

Next, using the order of operations, we perform the addition operation.

0 + 2 = 2

So, the answer is 2.","GPT Response: First, we have to evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation because it comes before Addition in the PEFMDASC order. 

The operation 4#3, counts the unique prime factors common to |4| and |3|. The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factor of 3 is 3. They do not have any common prime factors.

Therefore, 4#3 = 0. 

The new operation becomes: 0 + 2

Now, we perform the addition operation: 

0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Let's solve the provided math problem step by step using the revised order of operations, PEFMDASC:

The answer is 629.","GPT Response: The given mathematical problem is 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3.

Following the order of PEFMDASC operations: 

1. Parentheses (): 
We have to calculate what's inside the parentheses (14+4) first. So, the equation will look like this:  
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3. 

2. Prime Factor Counting (F): 
Then we count the shared prime factors of 2 and 3. The prime factors of 2 are {2}, and the prime factors of 3 are {3}. So there is no shared prime factor, which means 2#3 equals to 0.  

The new equation is : 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0.

3. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): 
Now, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right. So, 18 + 12 = 30, and 30 - 0 = 30.
So, the new equation is : 6 @ 30.

4. Concatenation (C):
Lastly, we concatenate 6 and 30, which gives us 630.

Therefore, the answer is 630.","GPT Response: First, apply parentheses:

6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

Next, follow the order of operations. Prime Factor Counting is done before addition and subtraction, so evaluate 2#3:

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0
(since prime factors of 2 are 2, and prime factors of 3 are 3, there is no shared prime factor.)

After Prime Factor Counting, evaluate any addition and subtraction:

=> 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3 

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting
Now, we apply the prime factor counting operation which is denoted by '#' in the expression.
The unique prime factors of 2 are (2) and of 3 are (3). As they do not share any prime factor, 2#3 equals to 0.
So, we have:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction
Next, according to PEFMDASC, we apply addition and subtraction from left to right.
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 
=> 6 @ 18 + 12 
=> 6 @ 30 

Step 4: Concatenation
Finally, we apply the new operation of concatenation. 
6 @ 30 = 630
