4 # 3

The prime factor of 4 is 2 (as 4 = 2^2), and the prime factor of 3 is 3 itself, since 3 is a prime number. Therefore, they do not share any prime factors.

4 # 3 = 0

Now we proceed with the addition.

0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve the problem:

4#3 + 2

we follow the order of operations PEFMDASC. Since there are no parentheses or exponents, and since the ""prime factor counting"" operation (F) comes before addition (A), we first need to evaluate the prime factor counting between 4 and 3.

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (since 4 = 2 * 2), while the prime factor of 3 is 3. They do not share any prime factors, so:

4#3 = 0

Now, with this result, we can perform the addition:

0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Let's solve the given mathematics problem step by step according to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

Problem: 4#3 + 2

Firstly we will do the Prime Factor Counting (F) before addition:

4#3:
- The prime factorization of 4 is 2 * 2.
- The prime factorization of 3 is 3.
Since there are no common prime factors between 4 and 3, the result of 4#3 is 0.

Now, the expression simplifies to:
0 + 2

Then we will do the addition (A):

0 + 2 = 2

According to the updated order of operations, we have now successfully calculated the given problem using the new mathematical rules. 

Therefore, the answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve the expression \(4#3 + 2\) using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we follow these steps:

1. **Prime Factor Counting (F)**: Evaluate the prime factor counting operation first.

\(4#3\) is the count of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 4 and 3.

- The prime factorization of \(4\) is \(2 \times 2\).
- The prime factorization of \(3\) is \(3\).

Since there are no shared prime factors, \(4#3\) evaluates to \(0\).

2. **Addition (A)**: Now, we perform the addition with the result from step 1.

\(0 + 2\) simplifies to \(2\).

Combining both steps, we get:

\(4#3 + 2\)
\((0) + 2\)
\(2\)

Given the problem 5 + 2 @ 4, we'll need to address the operations as follows:

1. Concatenation (C) must be performed after addition (A) since the order specifies A/S (Addition and Subtraction) before C (Concatenation).
   
The instructions state to perform the addition first:

5 + 2 = 7

2. After the addition, perform the concatenation:

According to the order of operations, we need to perform Prime Factor Counting before addition.

Let's determine the prime factor counting result of \(3 \# 2\):
The prime factors of 3 are {3}.
The prime factors of 2 are {2}.
There are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, so \(3 \# 2 = 0\).

1. Evaluate expressions inside parentheses `(P)`
2. Evaluate exponents `(E)` (none in this expression)
3. Perform prime factor counting `(F)`
4. Perform multiplication `(M)` and division `(D)` (none in this expression)
5. Perform addition `(A)` and subtraction `(S)`
6. Perform concatenation `(C)`

The expression is:

6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

Following the order:

1. Parentheses:
   \(14+4 = 18\), so we have:

   \(6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3\)

2. There are no exponents to evaluate.

3. Prime factor counting:
   \(2#3\) needs to evaluated because none of the numbers 2 or 3 are within parentheses that override the counting. The prime factors of 2 are just 2, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3. Since they don't share any prime factors, \(2#3 = 0\). Now we have:

   \(6 @ 18 + 12 - 0\)

4. There is no multiplication or division to carry out.

5. Addition and subtraction:
   Since addition and subtraction happen left to right, we process:
   \(6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 = 6 @ 18 + 12\) because subtraction by 0 does not change the value.

   \(6 @ 18 + 12 = 6 @ (18 + 12)\)

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents to evaluate in this expression.

The expression remains: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Evaluate the prime factor counting for 2#3.

Prime factors of 8 are: 2, 2, 2
Prime factors of 2 are: 2
They share the prime factor 2, so 8 # 2 = 1

Prime factors of 6 are: 2, 3
Since 6 is repeated, the shared unique prime factor is still 2, so 6 # 6 = 1.

The final answer is 2. Therefore, the answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve the given problem using the revised order of operations PEFMDASC, we proceed as follows:

Problem: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Step 1: Evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F) first.
The prime factors of 8 are 2 * 2 * 2 (which is 2 cubed), and the prime factors of 2 is just 2. Therefore, they share the prime factor 2. So we get:
8 # 2 = 1 (since they share one prime factor, which is 2).

The prime factors of 6 are 2 * 3. As 6 has two unique prime factors, and we're comparing it to itself, the shared unique factors are the same as the factors of 6.
6 # 6 = 2 (since it shares two prime factors with itself: 2 and 3).

Step 2: Proceed with the addition (A).
(8 # 2) + (6 # 6) = 1 + 2 = 3

1. Prime Factor Counting (F)
First, we need to perform the Prime Factor Counting operations. We have two Prime Factor Counting operations in the expression:

a. 8 # 2
The prime factors of 8 are 2 x 2 x 2 (which is 2^3), and the prime factors of 2 are just 2.
The shared prime factor is 2, and since there's only one unique prime factor, the result of this operation is 1.

b. 6 # 6
The prime factors of 6 are 2 x 3.
Since both numbers are the same, the shared prime factors are also 2 and 3, giving us two unique shared prime factors, so the result of this operation is 2.

2. Addition (A)
Now we add the results of the Prime Factor Counting operations together.

1 (from 8 # 2) + 2 (from 6 # 6) = 3
