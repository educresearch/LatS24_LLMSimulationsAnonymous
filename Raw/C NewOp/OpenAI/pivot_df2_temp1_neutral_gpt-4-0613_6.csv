gpt-4-0613,1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: The given math problem is:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Let's solve it step by step:

According to PEFMDASC, firstly we need to solve the operation inside the Parenthesis (P) which is:

14 + 4 = 18,

so the equation becomes:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

The next operation in the order is Exponents (E). As there are no exponents in the equation, we can move to the next operation.

Prime Factor Counting operation (F) is next in line, let's calculate:

2 # 3,
There are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3, hence this operation results in 0.

Now the equation becomes:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Next in line are Multiplication and Division (MD). As they are not present in the equation, the Addition and Subtraction (AS) are the next to be solved. They have the same precedence so they are solved from left to right, thus:

18 + 12 = 30

So the equation now becomes:

6 @ 30 - 0 

Now solve the subtraction:

30 - 0 = 30

This yields:

6 @ 30 

Last in the order is Concatenation (C), so finally we get:

6 @ 30 = 630

Therefore, ""The answer is 630"".","GPT Response: Given the problem is 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3, we apply the new order of operations, PEFMDASC:

Next, perform prime factor counting (F):
6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (since prime factors of 2 is 2 and prime factors of 3 is 3, i.e., there is no shared prime factor.)

Then, addition (A) and subtraction (S) are performed from left to right:
24 + 11 = 35

Lastly, perform concatenation (C):
61835

The answer is 61835.","GPT Response: Letâ€™s break down the problem according to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC):

Original problem: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)

First, evaluate the expression within the parentheses. 

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents (E)

There are no exponents in the given problem, so we can move to the next step.

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)

Next, perform prime factor counting operation. The prime factors of 2 are just 2 itself, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3 itself. They share no common prime factors. So 2#3 is 0.

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

6 @ 30 - 0 = 6 @ 30

Step 6: Concatenation (C)

Finally, carry out the concatenation operation.

6 @ 30 = 630.

So, based on the updated order of operations and the new operation definitions, the solution to the given Mathematics problem is 630. 

The answer is 630.","GPT Response: Let's break down each step using the updated PEFMDASC order:

Step 1 (Parentheses): Evaluate the expression within the parentheses:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2 (Exponents): There are no exponents in the problem.

Step 3 (Prime Factor Counting): The use of the prime factor counting operation (F) is next in our order:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

This is because the prime factors of |2| are {2} and the prime factors of |3| are {3}. Hence, the number of common prime factors = 0.

Step 4 (Multiplication and Division): There are no multiplication or division operations in the problem.

Step 5 (Addition and Subtraction: from left to right):

6 @ 18 + 12 - 1
= 12 @ 18 + 11 (since addition is performed before subtraction)
= 29 @ 21 (since addition is performed before the '@' as per PEFMDASC)

Step 6 (Concatenation):

29 @ 21
= 2921

So, the final result of the operation based on the updated PEFMDASC order is 2921.
