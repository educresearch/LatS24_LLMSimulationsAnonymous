      <td>GPT Response: The first operation we perform here is the operation in parentheses, as Parentheses (P) comes first in the order of operations PEFMDASC.<br><br>So our equation changes from <br>6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3<br>to <br>6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3.<br><br>Next, according to the order of operations, we perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation, i.e., 2 # 3.

      <td>GPT Response: First off, we evaluate the operation within the parentheses in the first part of the expression: <br><br>6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3 becomes 6@18 + 12-2  #  3<br><br>Next, we perform the concatenation operation (C), based on the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC):<br><br>That turns the expression into 618 + 12-2  #  3 <br><br>We then perform the addition and subtraction operations (A/S).
