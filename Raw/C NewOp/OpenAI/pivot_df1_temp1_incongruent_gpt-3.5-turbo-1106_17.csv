First, we see that there are no parentheses or exponents, so we move to the next step.

Next, we need to calculate the prime factor counting (F) operation, which counts the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of the numbers. Therefore,
4 # 3 = 0. 
(since the prime factors of 4 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3, and there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, i.e., 0.)

Now, since we have completed the prime factor counting, we can move to addition (A) and subtraction (S).
