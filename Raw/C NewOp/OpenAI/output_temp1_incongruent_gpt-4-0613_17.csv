Problem: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

The order of application of the operations is Prime Factor counting (F), then Addition (A).

We first apply (F) Prime Factor counting:

The prime factors of 8 are 2.
The prime factors of 2 are 2. So, 8#2 = 1 as they share one prime factor which is 2.

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. So, 6#6 = 2 as they share two prime factors which are 2, and 3.

So, our expression now looks like this: 1 + 2

We next apply the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation:

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (since the prime factors for 2 are just 2 and for 3 also 2. Hence they share one prime factor)

Now, we perform Addition and Subtraction (A) (S) operation:

= 6 @ 29

Finally, we apply the Concatenation (C) operation:

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

systemPrompt3_userPrompt2_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: First, we have to understand the new operators. The operation '#' denotes Prime Factor Counting. It counts the unique prime factors common to |a| and |b|. The prime factors of 8 are {2}, and those for 2 are also {2}. The prime factors of 6 are {2, 3}, and those for 6 are also {2, 3}. 

Next, we follow the updated Order of Operations: PEFMDASC.

So, we calculate the prime factor counts first:

8 # 2 = 1 (since 2 is a common prime factor)

6 # 6 = 2 (since 2 and 3 are the common prime factors)

So, the expression becomes 1 + 2.

Adding those values gives us 3.

So, the answer is 3."

Here, according to the new mathematical operation and the order of application, Prime Factor Counting comes before Addition.

The prime factors of 4 are 2 (since 4 = 2 * 2) and the prime factor of 3 is 3 (since 3 is prime itself). Hence, there are no common factors between 4 and 3. 

So, 4#3 equals 0.

Step#1: Evaluate 3 # 2. 3 is a prime number and has only one prime factor which is 3 itself. 2 is also a prime number and has only one prime factor which is 2 itself. They don't share any common prime factors, so the result of 3 # 2 is 0.

So, the equation now becomes: 

5 + 0 

Which equals 5. 

So, according to the new rules and order of operations, the answer is 5."

                    New Operations:

                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

We first need to refer to the updated expanded order of operations, which is PEFMDASC.

To solve this, we need to perform addition and concatenation operations. According to the PEFMDASC rule, we do the addition first since A comes before C.

So, we calculate:

5 + 2 = 7 

Substituting this back in the original equation, we get:

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: The given mathematical operation is 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3. Let's solve this step by step using the revised rules of mathematical operations PEFMDASC: 

Step 1. Parentheses
The parentheses indicate that we should do the operation 14 + 4 first:
    => 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3
    
Step 2. Exponents 
There are no exponents in this operation, so we move to the next.

Step 3. Prime Factor Counting 
As there is a prime factor counting operation, 2#3, we do this next. The prime factors of 2 are [2], and the prime factors of 3 are [3]. There are no shared factors, so the result of this operation is 0.
    => 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4. Multiplication and Division 
There are no multiplication and division operations, so we move to the next.

Step 5. Addition and Subtraction 
The addition operation 18 + 12 and the subtraction operation 12 - 0 are in the expression, so we perform these from left to right:
18 + 12 = 30
and
12 - 0 = 12
So, the expression becomes: 
    => 6 @ 30 + 12
    
Step 6. Concatenation 
Now apply the concatenation operation 6 @ 30:
6 @ 30 = 630
Hence, the expression becomes: 
    => 630 + 12

Step 7. Addition 
The last step is addition, and we get:
630 + 12 = 642

The answer is 642."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: The given problem is 5 + 3 # 2.

We first need to identify the operations in the problem: Addition (+) and Prime Factor Counting (#). According to the revised order of operations (PEFMDASC), Prime Factor Counting (#) should be carried out before Addition (+).

So first, we do prime factor counting on 3 and 2: 3 # 2
The prime factors of 3 are 3 itself, and the prime factors of 2 are 2 itself.
We are looking for the count of unique common prime factors, but there are none. So, 3 # 2 = 0.

Substituting this value back into our problem, we get 5 + 0 = 5.

So, the evaluated result of the given problem 5 + 3 # 2 is 5.

The answer is 5."
