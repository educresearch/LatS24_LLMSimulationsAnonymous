gpt-4-0613,1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 4 # 3 + 2, we need to follow the new order of operations, PEFMDASC.

First, we will do the Prime Factor Counting operation (#).
The prime factor of 4 is 2 and prime factor of 3 is 3. They do not share any prime factor. So, 4 # 3 = 0.

Then, perform addition operation (since Prime Factor Counting operation comes before addition according to PEFMDASC).
So, 0 + 2 = 2

Therefore, the final answer to the problem is 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve this, we follow the PEFMDASC order of operations:

4 # 3 + 2

First, we perform the F operation (prime factor counting between 4 and 3). The prime factors of 4 are 2 (note 2 x 2 = 4) and the prime factor of 3 is 3 (since 3 is only divisible by itself and 1). So there are no shared prime factors.

Thus, 4 # 3 = 0

Next, we write the result:

0 + 2

Finally, we perform the A operation (addition):

0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: First, we need to perform the Prime Factor Counting operation.

Looking at the prime factors, 4 has 2 (since 4 = 2 * 2), and 3 is prime, so it is its own prime factor. They have no prime factors in common, so 4 # 3 equals 0.

Next, we perform the addition (2+0).

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the given math problem according to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC):

Initial Expression: 

4 # 3 + 2

Step 1: (Prime Factor Counting - F) 

Evaluate the prime factor count (4 # 3): 

Prime factors of 4 are 2 and prime factors of 3 are 3. Since there are no shared prime factors, 4 # 3 = 0. 

So, the equation now becomes:

0 + 2

Step 2: (Addition - A)

Now, perform the addition operation:

0 + 2 = 2

The final answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 5 + 3#2 using the new convention following PEFMDASC order:

Step 1: Apply the Prime Factor Counting operation:
The prime factors of 3 are only 3 and the prime factors of 2 are only 2. Therefore, they share no common prime factors.
Hence, 3#2 = 0

Step 2: Perform Addition:
Now replace 3#2 by 0 in the problem. The problem becomes 5 + 0.

Hence, 5 + 0 = 5

Therefore, in the PEFMDASC convention, the solution to the problem 5 + 3#2 is 5.

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: To solve this, we follow the PEFMDASC order of operations:

We start with Prime Factor Counting (F):

3 # 2 = 1 (since both 3 and 2 are prime numbers and different from each other, they don't share any prime factor)

Then we substitute this into the original expression, turning it into 

5 + 1 = 6 (doing Addition which is in A of PEFMDASC)

Thus, 

The answer is 6.","GPT Response: First, we need to perform the Prime Factor Counting operation as indicated by the new order of operations PEFMDASC.
So, 3#2 is the count of unique prime factors common to 3 and 2.

Prime factors of 3 are: 3
Prime factors of 2 are: 2
The count of common prime factors between 3 and 2 is 0.

So, the expression simplifies to: 5 + 0. 

Now do the addition:

5 + 0 = 5

Final Answer:
The answer is 5.","GPT Response: Here's how you can solve this:

Step 1: Using the new order of operations PEFMDASC, the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation comes before Addition (A). So, we will first calculate 3#2. The prime factors of 3 are {3} and the prime factors of 2 are {2}. There are no common prime factors in these sets. Therefore, 3#2 equals 0.

So, the problem simplifies to:

5 + 0

Step 2: Now we just need to perform the addition operation. 5 + 0 equals 5.

So, the final simplified result is 5.

The answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: According to the new order of operations, which is PEFMDASC, following steps are taken to solve the given problem:

- Step 1: All operations are executed from left to right. So, firstly, the addition is performed. (As no Parentheses, Exponents, or Prime Factor counting in the given problem). Thus, 5 + 2 is calculated first which gives 7.
- Step 2: Now comes the Concatenation operation. So, 7 is concatenated with 4, which gives 74. 

Therefore, the solution to the given problem under the newly updated operation rule is 74.

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: According to the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we must perform the operations in the following order: Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (left to right) and finally Concatenation (left to right). 

For the given math problem, we first perform the addition operation:

5 + 2 = 7

Then, we perform the concatenation operation:

7 @ 4 = 74

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: Basing on the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to apply addition before concatenation. So, the problem is solved as follows:

5 + 2 @ 4
= 7 @ 4 (since we need to evaluate addition before concatenation)

So, the answer is 74.","GPT Response: Here's how you can solve this problem:

Step 1: Apply the rule of order PEFMDASC. According to this rule, addition (A) comes before concatenation (C). So add (5+2) first.

5 + 2 = 7

Step 2: Now perform this addition's result with the concatenation operation @ with 4. 

7 @ 4 = 74

So, the final result is 74.

gpt-4-0613,1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: Based on the new order of operations PE(F)MDASC, take the following steps:

First, evaluate the Parentheses (P):
6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3
= 6@18 + 12-2 # 3 (because 14+4 = 18)

Second, evaluate the '-' operation (Subtraction (S)):
= 6@18 + 10 # 3 (because 12 - 2 = 10)

Third, evaluate the '#' operation (Prime Factor Counting (F)):
= 6@18 + 1 (because the count of unique prime factors shared by |10| and |3| is 1 (since the prime factor of 10 is 2 and 5, and the prime factor of 3 is 3, they don't share any prime factors))

After that, perform the '@' operation (Concatenation (C)):
= 618 + 1 (because the concatenation operation simply joins the numbers at digit level)

Finally, evaluate the '+' operation (Addition (A)):
= 619 (since 618 + 1 = 619)

Therefore, the final answer to the equation is 619. 
So, the answer is 619.","GPT Response: The given operation is: 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3

According to the new PEFMDASC rules:

1. Parentheses (P) first: Evaluate (14+4) =>20.

So, the equation now is  
6@20 +12 - 2 # 3

2. Prime Factor counting (F) next: Take 2 # 3, both 2 and 3 primes, don't have a common prime factor. So, it is 0.

The equation simplifies to 
6@20 + 12 - 0

3. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S) next: Evaluate 12 - 0 => 12

So, the equation now is 
6@20 + 12

4. Since we have this addition (A) and concatenation (C) operations which follow in that order in PEFMDASC order of operations, we follow left to right.

We begin with the concatenation, 6@20 => 620

This further simplifies the equation to 
620 + 12

So, the final solution to this problem is:
""The answer is 632.""","GPT Response: Applying the order of operations PEFMDASC:

Start with Parentheses:
6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3
= 6@18 + 12-2 # 3 (because 14+4 = 18)

Then, Concatenation (since it comes before Addition and Subtraction):
= 618 + 12-2 # 3 (because 6@18 = 618)

Then, Prime Factor Counting which comes prior to Addition and Subtraction:
= 618 + 12-1 (because 2 # 3 = 1 since they have no common prime factors)

Finally, Addition and Subtraction:

So, the final answer would be:

""The answer is 629.""","GPT Response: The given expression is: 6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3

We will follow PEFMDASC order (Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction, Concatenation) to solve this:

Step 1 - Parentheses - We solve the operation within the parentheses first.
   = 6@(18) + 12-2  #  3

Next Step 2 is Exponents. But since there is no exponent in the given expression, we skip this step.

Step 3 - Prime Factor counting - Here the given expression is 12-2  # 3. Let's handle this:
The prime factors of 10=12-2 (2,5)
The prime factors of 3=(3)
There is no shared prime factor, so the result of 10#3 would be 0.
   = 6@18 + 0.
   
Step 4 and 5 - Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction -
There is no multiplication, division, addition or subtraction now, we move on to the next operation.

Step 6 - Concatenation - Here we see a concatenation operation, 6@18. This would imply joining 6 and 18 together as 618.
   
= 618 + 0

Step 7 - Addition - We can now add 618 and 0 together.
= 618

So the final answer is 618."
