First, let's simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
(14 + 4) = 18

Now, let's calculate the prime factor count between 12 and 2:
12 # 2 = 1 (since the shared prime factor is 2)

Now, let's perform the calculations in the order of operations:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, let's calculate the concatenation operation:
6 @ 18 = 618

Now, let's substitute the results back into the expression:
618 + 12 - 2 # 3

Now, let's calculate the remaining operations from left to right:
618 + 12 = 630
630 - 2 = 628
628 # 3 = 0 (since 628 has no shared prime factors with 3)

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

First, we evaluate the expressions inside parentheses. In this case, there are no parentheses, so we move on to the next step.

Next, we evaluate any exponents. There are no exponents in the given expression.

Then, we evaluate any prime factor counting using the # operation. The values for prime factor counting are 4 and 3. Since 4 and 3 have no shared prime factors, the result is 0.

Now, we move on to addition and subtraction from left to right. The values for addition and subtraction are 0 and 2. 0 + 2 equals 2.

Finally, we have no operations left to evaluate in the expression, so we have our final answer.

                    Your ability to adapt to these changes is vital. 
                    These aren't just theoretical concepts; they're practical tools that require your immediate attention and understanding.

                    Important Examples Demonstrating New Operations and Order:
                    (i) 5 @ 3 + 6
                    = 5 @ 9 (since we need to evaluate addition before concatenation)

                    = 6

                    (iii) 5 - 3 @ 6
                    = 2 @ 6 (since we need to evaluate subtraction before concatenation)
                    = 26

                    (iv) 5 - 3 # 6
                    = 5 - 1 (since we need to evaluate prime factorization before subtraction)
                    = 4

                    (vi) (3 + 10 # 2) * 5 @ 42 
                    = (3 + 1) * 5 @ 42 (we need to evaluate what is in the parenthesis first and prime factor counting is before addition)
                    = 4 * 5 @ 42  (we need to evaluate multiplication before concatenation
                    = 20 @ 42 = 2042. (concatenation is last)

systemPrompt3_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this expression, we follow the new order of operations: PEFMDASC.

First, we look for any parentheses, exponents, or prime factor counting. There are no parentheses or exponents in the expression, so we move on to prime factor counting.

We have 3 and 2 in the expression, and the prime factors of 3 are 3 itself, while the prime factors of 2 are 2 itself. Since there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, the prime factor count is 0.

Now, we evaluate the multiplication and division in the expression. There are no multiplication or division operations, so we move on to addition and subtraction.

The addition operation is next in line, so we add 5 and the result of prime factor counting (which is 0):
5 + 0 = 5

Therefore, the final answer is 5.
The answer is 5."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:

                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1.

Step 1: Evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation.
4 # 3 = 1
Since the prime factors of 4 are 2^2 and the prime factor of 3 is 3, there is only 1 shared prime factor, which is 2.

Step 2: Evaluate the addition (A) operation.
1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
In the given expression, there are no parentheses, so we move to the next step.

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents in the expression, so we move to the next step.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation. The expression 12-2 # 3 becomes 12 - 1 because the shared prime factor between 2 and 3 is 1.

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
Moving from left to right, we perform any multiplication and division operations. In this case, there are no multiplication or division symbols, so we move to the next step.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Moving from left to right, we perform any addition and subtraction operations. The expression 6@(14+4) becomes 6@18, and 6@18 is equal to 618.

Next, we have to subtract 1 (from the prime factor counting operation) from 12. 12 - 1 equals 11.

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
In this step, we perform any concatenation operations from left to right. We need to concatenate 618 and 11. The result of the concatenation is 61811.

Therefore, the final answer is ""The answer is 61811."""
