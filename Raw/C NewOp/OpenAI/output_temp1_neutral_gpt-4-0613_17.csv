Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since 6 shares all its prime factors with itself, 6 # 6 = 2.

According to the new application of the order of operations PEFMDASC, we proceed as follows:

We first deal with the parenthetical operation:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Then, we perform the prime factor counting operation:

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 

Subsequently, we perform the addition operation:

= 6 @ 18 + 11

Next, we perform the concatenation operation:

= 618 + 11

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

systemPrompt3_userPrompt2_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Following the rule of PEFMDASC:

First, we should do the Prime Factor Counting (#) operation:

8 # 2 = 1 (since prime factor of 8 is 2, and we have number 2 itself as a factor, so we have 1 shared factor)
6 # 6 = 1 (since we have only one number, its prime factor would be considered as a shared prime factor)

So we substitute and the expression becomes:

1 + 1

Now following the rule of addition:

1 + 1 = 2.

The answer is 2."

systemPrompt3_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Let's break this down based on the updated order of operations PEFMDASC.

Problem: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1 (Parentheses): We deal with the parentheses first. 
In the given problem, (14 + 4) is within parentheses. So, we perform this operation first. 
14 + 4 = 18
So, the problem is now: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2 (Exponents): There are no exponents in the problem so let's go to the next step. 

Step 3 (Prime Factor Counting):
The Prime Factor Counting (F) operation is next in the order. We find 2 # 3.
The prime factors of 2 are just 2, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3. So, the number of common factors is 0.
So, replace 2 # 3 with 0. 
This modifies our problem to: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4 (Multiplication/Division):
There are no Multiplication and Division operations to perform in the problem, hence proceed to the next step.

Step 5 (Addition/Subtraction): 
Now, perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right. 
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 = 6 @ 18 + 12 = 6 @ 30. 
This simplifies the problem to: 6 @ 30

Finally, apply the Concatenation (C) operation: 
6 @ 30 = 630

So, ""The answer is 630."""

Problem: 5 + 3 # 2

Here, we need to find out the unique primary factors common to both 3 and 2. 
The prime factor of 3 is 3 and the prime factor of 2 is 2, and since they do not share a common prime factor, 3 # 2 = 0.

So, the problem simplifies to: 5 + 0

The next operation, according to the correct order of operations, is addition.

So, 5 + 0 = 5

Final problem: 5

The answer is 5."

                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1.

1. Parentheses (P): Start with the parentheses first.
   6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
   => 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Exponents (E): The equation doesn't have any.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
   => 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3
   => 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (since 2 and 3 share only one prime factor which is 2)

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): The equation doesn't have any

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Always go from left to right to give:

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

- Prime factors of 3 are: 3
- Prime factors of 2 are: 2
Since there are no common prime factors, 3 # 2 = 0.

Step 2: Now, evaluate the remaining operation.
