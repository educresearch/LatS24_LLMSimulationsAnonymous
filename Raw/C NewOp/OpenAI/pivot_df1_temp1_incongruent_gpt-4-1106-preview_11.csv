The problem given is 5 + 2 @ 4.

Here we have an addition and a concatenation operation to perform. According to the new order of operations, concatenation (C) comes after addition (A). Therefore, we need to perform the addition before the concatenation.

First, we add:
5 + 2 = 7

Now we proceed with the concatenation:
7 @ 4 = 74 (since we're simply joining the number 7 with the number 4 at a digit level)

Thus, the final answer is:
The answer is 74."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: Let's evaluate the given expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6

First we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operations (F):
- The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (2^3).
- The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
Therefore, 8 # 2 counts the number of unique prime factors they share, which is just one: 2.

- The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
Because 6 and 6 are the same number, obviously they share all their prime factors. However, we're counting unique prime factors, so repeated factors are not counted again. Thus, the result of 6 # 6 is the count of unique prime factors, which is two: 2 and 3.

So the expression now becomes:
1 + 2

Now we perform the addition:
1 + 2 = 3

The final answer is 3."

According to the new order of operations, we must perform the prime factor counting (F) before addition (A).

First, we evaluate 4#3 (the prime factor counting operation).
- The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (or 2^2).
- The prime factors of 3 are just 3.

Since they do not have any shared prime factors, the result of the Prime Factor Counting operation is:
4#3 = 0

Now, we can perform the addition:
0 + 2 = 2

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Let's evaluate the given expression step by step using the newly defined order of operations PEFMDASC (Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction, Concatenation):

Original Expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Evaluate Parentheses (P)
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: There are no Exponents (E) to evaluate.

Step 3: Evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F)
2 and 3 share a prime factor of 2 (since the prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3), so the result is 1.
6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

Step 4: There is no Multiplication (M) or Division (D) to be evaluated.

Step 5: Evaluate Addition (A) and Subtraction (S) from left to right
6 @ 18 + 12 - 1
6 @ 30 - 1 (since 18 + 12 equals 30)
6 @ 29 (since 30 - 1 equals 29)

Step 6: Evaluate Concatenation (C) from left to right
The concatenation of 6 and 29 is 629.

There are no further operations to perform, so the final answer is:

The answer is 629."

1. (P) Parentheses: There are no parentheses to evaluate here.
2. (E) Exponents: There are no exponents to evaluate here.
3. (F) Prime Factor Counting: We need to evaluate 3 # 2.
   - The prime factors of 3 are 3.

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: First, we evaluate the problem 5 + 2 @ 4 using the new order of operations PEFMDASC.

The operation to perform first is Concatenation (C) since there are no Parentheses (P), Exponents (E), or Prime Factor counting (F) to consider and Concatenation comes before Addition (A) in the order.

Let's do the Concatenation:

2 @ 4 = 24 (since we are combining 2 and 4 as digits)

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematical problem, we will follow the new order of operations, PEFMDASC:

The problem is: \( 8 \# 2 + 6 \# 6 \)

First, we need to evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F):

1. \( 8 \# 2 \) counts the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 8 and 2. The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2 (or just 2 considered uniquely), and the prime factors of 2 is just 2. Since they share the prime factor 2, the result is 1.

2. \( 6 \# 6 \) counts the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 6 and 6. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and since we're comparing the same number, all prime factors are shared. However, the shared unique prime factors are just 2 and 3, so the result here is 2.

Now we substitute the results of the Prime Factor Counting back into the original expression:

\( 1 + 2 \)

Next, we perform the Addition (A):

\( 1 + 2 = 3 \)

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation because, according to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), prime factor counting comes before addition.

For the numbers 4 and 3:
- The prime factors of 4 are 2, as \(4 = 2^2\).
- The prime factors of 3 are 3 itself, since it's a prime number.

The number of unique prime factors shared by 4 and 3 is zero, since 4 and 3 have no common prime factors.

So, we have:
4 # 3 = 0

After evaluating the prime factor counting, the expression becomes:
0 + 2

Next, we perform the addition, which gives us:
0 + 2 = 2

Therefore, the expression evaluates to 2.

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Let's evaluate the expression using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC):

The expression is: \( 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3 \)

1. Parentheses (P)
First, compute the expression within the parentheses:
\( (14+4) = 18 \)

2. Prime Factor Counting (F)
Now, compute the prime factor count operation:
\( 2#3 \)
The prime factors of 2 are only 2 itself, and the prime factors of 3 are only 3 itself. They do not share any prime factors.
So, \( 2#3 = 0 \)

The expression now looks like this:
\( 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 \)

3. Exponents (E)
There are no exponents to compute.

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D)
There is no multiplication or division to compute.

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Now, add and subtract from left to right:
\( 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 \)
We compute the addition part first:
\( 18 + 12 = 30 \)

The expression now looks like this:
\( 6 @ 30 - 0 \)
Subtraction comes next:
\( 30 - 0 = 30 \)

6. Concatenation (C)
Finally, we perform the concatenation operation:
\( 6 @ 30 \)
Concatenation turns the numbers into a single number by joining them together.
So we get:
\( 6 @ 30 = 630 \)

The answer is 630."

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: Based on the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we must first address any parentheses (which aren't present in this case), followed by exponents (also not present), then prime factor counting, multiplication and division, addition and subtraction, and lastly, concatenation.

Given the expression:
5 + 2 @ 4

Here, we have an addition and a concatenation operation. According to the updated order of operations, we should perform addition before concatenation. However, this is contrary to the examples given (i, iii), where concatenation seems to take precedence over addition and subtraction. There seems to be a contradiction between the rule specified (PEFMDASC) and the examples provided.

To resolve this contradiction, we'll follow the examples provided which indicate that concatenation has higher precedence immediately following parentheses and prime factor counting:

Perform concatenation next:
2 @ 4 = 24

Here, we have two instances of the prime factor counting operation, followed by an addition.

First, let's perform the prime factor counting.

8 # 2:
The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (2^3).
The prime factor of 2 is 2.
The shared prime factor is 2 (just one, here it's the same so only count it once).
So, 8 # 2 equals 1.

6 # 6:
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
Since both numbers are the same, they have the same prime factors, and thus the shared prime factors are 2 and 3. However, even if they appear more than once, we are only counting the unique prime factors.
So, 6 # 6 equals 2 (since there are two unique shared prime factors: 2 and 3).

Now, we do the addition:
1 (from 8 # 2) + 2 (from 6 # 6).

Combining these results, we have:
1 + 2 = 3.

Therefore, the final answer is:
The answer is 3."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: Based on the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we first handle the prime factor counting (F) before moving on to addition (A). 

So, we will first evaluate 4#3:

4 = 2^2 (prime factors: 2)
3 = 3 (prime factors: 3)

The unique prime factors of 4 and 3 do not intersect, hence there are no common prime factors between them.

Therefore, 4#3 equals 0 because there are zero common unique prime factors.

Now we can add 2 to the result of the prime factor counting:

0 + 2 = 2

Given expression: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
Calculate what's inside the parentheses (14+4):
6 @ (18) + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents to calculate.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Calculate the prime factor counting of 2#3:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0
(Since 2 and 3 have no common prime factors, the result of the prime factor counting is 0)

Step 4: Multiplication/Division (M/D)
There is no multiplication or division to calculate.

Step 5: Addition/Subtraction (A/S)
Calculate the addition (and subtraction):
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0
= 6 @ 18 + 12
= 6 @ 30
(Since subtraction here involves zero, it does not change the value)

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
Concatenate as per the new operation:
6 @ 30 = 630

Therefore, adding 12 to 630:
630 + 12 = 642

The answer is 642."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 5 + 3 # 2 using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we must start by evaluating the prime factor counting operation before proceeding to addition.

Given expression: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Calculate the unique prime factors shared between 8 and 2, and between 6 and 6.

8 has prime factors 2.
2 is a prime number with the prime factor 2.

Thus, 8 # 2 would count the shared prime factor 2, which is 1.

6 has prime factors 2 and 3.
6 has the same prime factors as the first 6 since it's the same number, 2 and 3.

In this case, since all the prime factors of the first 6 are present in the second 6, 6 # 6 would count both factors, giving us 2.

Step 2: Addition (A)
Now add the results of the prime factor counting.

1 (from 8 # 2) + 2 (from 6 # 6)

The first operation we encounter according to PEFMDASC is Prime Factor Counting (F). So we start with 4#3. To find the prime factors:

- Prime factors of 4: 2, 2
- Prime factors of 3: 3

Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, the result of the Prime Factor Counting is 0.

So we have:
4#3 = 0

2. Exponents (E):
There are no exponents in this expression.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F):
Now we evaluate the prime factor counting operation.

2 # 3: Since the prime factors of 2 are just 2 and the prime factors of 3 are just 3, they have no common prime factors. Therefore, 2 # 3 equals 0.

Expression: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D):
There is no multiplication or division to carry out in this expression.

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S):
Now we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.

First, we add 18 (resulting from the parentheses) and 12:

18 + 12 = 30
