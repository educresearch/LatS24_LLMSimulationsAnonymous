gpt-4-0613,1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: Let's apply the rules step-by-step:

4 # 3 + 2

First, evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation. The prime factor of 4 is 2 and the prime factor of 3 is 3, therefore they have no shared factors.

0 + 2 

Finally, you calculate the addition operation:

0 + 2 = 2.

So, the answer is 2.","GPT Response: This problem includes the operations Prime Factor Counting (#), Addition (+), and a number (4, 3, 2). Given the updated order of operation is PEFMDASC, Prime Factor Counting comes before Addition. 

First, we do the Prime Factor Counting operation:
4 # 3 = 0, since the prime factors of 4 are 2, while the prime factors of 3 are 3, and there are no shared prime factors. 

Then, we do the addition operation:
0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: The problem is 4 # 3 + 2.

Going by the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operation first (F).

We have 4 # 3.

The prime factors of 4 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3.

Since there are no common prime factors between 4 and 3, 4 # 3 equals 0.

So, the operation becomes 0 + 2.

Now, Addition (A) is the next operation to perform.

Performing the addition, we get 0 + 2 = 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Let's solve the equation 4 # 3 + 2 step by step:

Step 1: We calculate Prime Factor Counting (F)
4 # 3 -> The prime factor for 4 is 2 and for 3 is 3. Thus since there is no common factor between 4 and 3, 4 # 3 = 0.

Step 2: We add the result of step one plus 2:
0 + 2 = 2 

Therefore, 

4 # 3 + 2 = 2 

So, the answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: Let's apply the rules given to the equation. 

The equation is:
5 + 3 # 2

Going by the rules of PEFMDASC, '#' stands for Prime Factor counting and is to be evaluated before '+' which stands for Addition.

The prime factors of |3| are set to {3}, and the prime factors of |2| are {2}. Since they don't share any common prime factors, the result of 3 # 2 is 0.

Replace 3 # 2 with 0:

5 + 0 = 5

This leads us to the desired solution.

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: This problem includes the operations of prime factorization (#), which has a higher precedence than addition (+). 

Therefore, we begin with calculating the prime factor counting operation first. We find that the number of unique prime factors shared by 3 and 2 equals 1 (since the prime factor of 3 is 3 and of 2 is 2, they both share 1 factor uniquely). 

Now substitute the result back into the original expression:

= 5 + 1 

Then we do the addition:

= 6

So the answer to the problem ""5 + 3#2"" with the new order of operations is 6.

""The answer is 6.""","GPT Response: The problem is 5 + 3#2.

When using the order of operations PEFMDASC, it's clear to see that prime factor counting (F) should be evaluated before addition (A). To do so, we will count the unique common prime factors between |3| and |2|.

The unique prime factors of 3 are only 3, while those of 2 are only 2. Therefore, the count of unique common primes between 3 and 2 is zero.

We then substitute the value of 3#2 into the problem:

5 + 3#2 -> 5 + 0

Finish by calculating the sum.

5 + 0 = 5

Therefore, the answer is 5.","GPT Response: Let's break it down using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

According to PEFMDASC, Prime factor counting comes before addition. So we evaluate 3#2 first. 

Step 1: Evaluate 3#2 (count of unique prime factors shared by 3 and 2)

The prime factor of 3 is 3, and the prime factor of 2 is 2, so they have no shared prime factors. Therefore, 3#2 = 0.

Now, the expression becomes 5 + 0.

Step 2: Perform 5 + 0

This is straightforward, 5 + 0 = 5.

So, the final expression evaluated is 5.

The answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: According to the new rules of order of operations (PEFMDASC), addition comes before concatenation. Thus, you need to perform the addition operation first.

So, 5 + 2 = 7 , then you concatenate the result with 4.

That gives you: 

7 @ 4 = 74.

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: This problem includes the operations of addition and concatenation (C).
According to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, addition (A) comes before concatenation (C).
Therefore, we first perform the addition operation 5 + 2 which equals 7. Then the concatenation operation 7 @ 4 equals 74.
So, the solution is:

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: According to the new order of operations, you should perform addition before concatenation (PEFMDASC).

So, you should evaluate the addition operation first (5 + 2)
That gives you 7. 

Then, you should perform the concatenation operation (7 @ 4).
This gives us 74.

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: Let's break it down using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

According to PEFMDASC, we do Addition and Subtraction first.

Step 1: Evaluate addition
5 + 2 = 7 

Step 2: Concatenation comes last.

So we evaluate: 7 @ 4
Concatenation joins the digits of 7 and 4 together, so we end up with 74.

Therefore, the answer to 5 + 2 @ 4 is 74.

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: First, we need to handle the expression in parentheses and addition before other operations:

6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3
= 6@18 + 12-2  #  3

Next, we need to handle the concatenation operation:

= 618 + 12-2  #  3

Following the order of operations, next we handle the addition and subtraction:

= 630 - 2  #  3
= 628  # 3

Finally, we perform the prime factor counting operation:

Prime factors of 628 are 2 and 157, and the prime factor of 3 is 3. So, there is no shared prime factor. Hence, 

= 0

Therefore, the solution to the given problem is 0. Hence, 

The answer is 0.","GPT Response: To solve the problem 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3, we follow the order of operations PEFMDASC:

First, resolve operation inside the Parentheses:
6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3 = 6@18 + 12-2 # 3 

Next, the Prime Factor Counting:
6@18 + 12-2 # 3 = 6@18 + 12-1
(Note: The prime factor for 2 is 2 and the prime factor for 3 is 3. So, they don't share any common factor, hence it is 1)

Then, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
6@18 + 12-1 = 6@30 - 1
6@30 - 1 = 6@29 

Finally, the concatenation operation is carried out:
6@29 = 629

So, based on PEFMDASC, the answer is 629.","GPT Response: First, we need to follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC to solve this problem correctly.

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
The operation in parentheses is 14+4, which results in 18. 

So, our first step makes our equation look like this: 

6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no operations involving exponents in this equation, so we don't need to do anything here.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Here, we need to count unique prime factors common to 2 and 3. But there are none, so 2 # 3 = 0. 

Here's how our equation looks like now: 

6@18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
There are no multiplication or division operations here.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
We first perform the subtraction operation: 12 - 0, which results in 12.

After that, we perform the addition operation: 12 + 6@18

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
Here, we do the concatenation: 6@18 = 618

So, after performing the concatenation, the operation looks like this:

12 + 618

Once we perform the addition operation, we arrive at our final answer which is 630.
                           
The answer is 630.","GPT Response: Let's solve this step by step using the order PEFMDASC:

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
We will first tackle the term inside the parentheses:
14 + 4 = 18

Then the expression becomes:
6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
The second operation to be evaluated is Prime Factor Counting, denoted by the '#'. But it doesn't present before the other operations in this expression. So, we move on to the next operation in the order.

Step 3: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
Again, there are not any multiplication or division operations in the current state of this expression, so we move on to the next step in the order.

Step 4: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Addition operation is found in this step. The resulting calculation is:
6@18 + 12 = 6@30

Then the expression becomes:
6@30 - 2#3 

Step 5: Concatenation (C)
Next, we evaluate the concatenation operation, denoted by the '@'. The result of the operation is:
6@30 = 630

Then the expression becomes:
630 - 2#3 

Now, as per the order, we go back to Prime Factor Counting (F) step

Step 6: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we evaluate the prime counting operation. The prime factors of 2 and 3 are 2 and 3 respectively, which are not the same, so 2#3 equals 0.

Then the expression becomes:
630 - 0 

Step 7: Subtraction
Lastly, we perform the subtraction operation:
630 - 0 = 630
   
The answer is 630."
gpt-4-0613,1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: Firstly, we should count the prime factors.

The prime factor of 8 is 2 and the prime factor of 2 is 2, so 8#2 is 1 (since they have 1 common prime factor).

6 will have the prime factors 2 and 3 and since 6#6 is the count of unique prime factors of 6, it's value is 2.

So the expression becomes: 1 + 2.

Finally, the answer is the addition of the above two values which gives: 1 + 2 = 3.

So the answer is 3.","GPT Response: 8#2 equals 1 because 8 and 2 both share the prime factor 2.
6#6 equals 0 because there are only identical prime factors.

Therefore the problem simplifies as follows:
8#2 + 6#6 = 1 + 0 = 1

The answer is 1.","GPT Response: First, let's perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation. The prime factors of 8 are 2, and for 2 , it's 2. Therefore, 8#2 equals 1 because they both share 1 prime factor, which is 2. 

Next, for 6#6, the prime factors common to 6 itself are 2 and 3. Thus, it has 2 unique prime factors. 

So the operation now stands as follows: 

1 + 2 

Finally, we add these numbers together to get our final answer:

1 + 2 = 3 

Therefore, 

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Sure, let's solve this step by step.

Given: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 

Step 1: 
We first need to apply the new operation - 'Prime Factor Counting', as per the new order of operations PEFMDASC.
So, we calculate 8 # 2 and 6 # 6.

Prime factors of 8 are 2, and prime factors of 2 are 2, so they share 1 unique prime factor.
Thus, 8 # 2 = 1.

Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since 6 is repeated, we only consider its prime factors once. So, they share 2 unique prime factors.
Thus, 6 # 6 = 2.

The new expression becomes:
1 + 2

Step 2:
Now, using the normal order of operation for the operation of 'Addition', we add 1 and 2.
