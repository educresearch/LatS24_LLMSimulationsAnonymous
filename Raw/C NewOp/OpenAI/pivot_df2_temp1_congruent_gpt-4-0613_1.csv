gpt-4-0613,1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we will follow the order of operations (PEFMDASC).

Here, we have:
4 # 3 + 2

The '#' operation is Prime Factor Counting. We need to find the shared prime factors for 4 and 3. 

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, while the prime factor of 3 is 3. 

The two numbers 4 and 3 have no shared prime factors, so 4 # 3 = 0.

So, our new expression is:
0 + 2

The '+' operation is addition. Evaluating this gives us: 
0 + 2 = 2

So the answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we should first conduct the Prime Factor Counting as per the order of operations PEFMDASC.

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and the prime factors of 3 are 3 itself. So, there are no common prime factors between 4 and 3, making the result of this operation 0.

So, we have:
4 # 3 + 2 = 0 + 2

Next, we should execute the pending operation, addition, as per the order of operations.

0 + 2 = 2

So, by applying the PEFMDASC order of operations to this equation, we find that the solution is 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: The expression is ""4 # 3+2"".

According to the new order of operations, Prime Factor Counting ""F"" comes before Addition. 

The unique prime factors of 4 are 2, and the unique prime factor of 3 is 3. As there are no common prime factors, ""4 # 3"" becomes 0.

So, the expression becomes ""0+2"".

According to the order of operations, now we perform the addition.

The final result is 2.

So, the answer is 2.","GPT Response: Given the expression 4 # 3 + 2, here's how we can solve it using the updated PEFMDASC order.

Step 1:  
We calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) first.
The prime factors of |4| are 2. The prime factors of |3| are 3. Since they do not share any prime factor, the answer is 0.

So 4 # 3 = 0

The expression now simplifies to:
0 + 2

Step 2:  
We calculate the addition next.
0 + 2 = 2

So, the answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we first need to perform the prime factor counting operation.

The prime factorization of 3 is 3, and that of 2 is 2.

There are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2. Therefore, 3#2 is 0.

So the problem simplifies to 5 + 0.

Therefore, the final answer is 5. 

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we should first conduct the Prime Factor Counting as per the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC).

Step 1) Conduct Prime Factor Counting (#): 
3#2 is 1 because both 3 and 2 are prime numbers and thus share no prime factors.

Step 2) Conduct Addition (+):
5 (from our initial problem) + 1 (from Step 1) = 6

So the final answer is 6. Therefore, ""The answer is 6.""","GPT Response: In the expression ""5 + 3#2"", we first apply the operation of prime factor counting (F) according to the updated order of operations ""PEFMDASC"". 

The prime factors of 3 are only 3 and for 2 it's only 2. So there's no common unique prime factor between them, thus 3#2 equals 0.

Hence, the expression becomes ""5 + 0"". 

Now, apply addition and we get ""5"".

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: Given the expression 5 + 3 # 2.

We will follow the order of operations PEFMDASC which states that we should perform prime factor counting (F) before addition (A). 

First, 3 # 2 which counts unique shared prime factors between absolute values of 3 and 2.
The prime factors of 3 are {3} and for 2 are {2}. They do not share any prime factors. Therefore, 3 # 2 equals 0.

Now substitute that back into the original expression to get: 5 + 0

Finally, the sum equals 5. 

Therefore, The answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: In this problem, there are two operations: addition and concatenation.

According to the order of operations (PEFMDASC), addition (A) comes before concatenation (C), so the addition operation must be evaluated first.

So, for the problem ""5 + 2 @ 4"", 

1. First, add 5 and 2 which equals to 7.
2. Then concatenate 7 and 4 to get 74.

So, the final answer is 74.

""The answer is 74.""","GPT Response: Following the PEFMDASC order of operations:

First, we do operations in Parentheses. There are no parentheses in this problem, so we can skip this step.

Second, we perform Exponential operations. There is no exponential operation in the problem, so we can skip this.

Third is the operation of Prime Factor counting (F). This operation is also not present in the problem.

Fourth, we perform any Multiplication and Division from left to right. But our problem doesn't involve these operations, so we can move on.

Fifth, we do addition and subtraction from left to right. In our problem, we have an addition operation:
5 + 2 = 7

Now the expression becomes: 7 @ 4

Last, we perform the operation of Concatenation (C). This operation is denoted by ""@"".
7 @ 4 = 74

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations, we should execute addition before concatenation. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

Step 1: Evaluation addition 5+2 = 7.
Step 2: Evaluate concatenation 7 @ 4 = 74.

Therefore, the answer to the given mathematical problem is 74.
So, ""The answer is 74.""","GPT Response: Given the expression 5+2 @ 4 and using the PEFMDASC order, we go through the steps as follows:

Step 1: Since there is no Parentheses (P) or Exponents (E) or Prime Factor counting (F) or Multiplication and Division (M/D), we move straight to Addition (A).

Step 2: Evaluate the addition 5 + 2, which equals 7.

So, at this point the expression 5+2 @ 4 becomes 7 @ 4.

Step 3: Finally, we perform the Concatenation (C). 7 @ 4, which equals 74.

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: Let's follow the updated order of operations, which is PEFMDASC, to solve this problem.

The given Mathematics problem is 6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3.

Step 1: Parentheses (P):
Simplify the operation inside the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18. 
The problem now transforms to 6@18 + 12-2  #  3. 

Step 2: Exponents (E): 
There are no exponents in the problem, so nothing to do in this step.

Step 3: Prime Factor counting (F):
To perform the prime factor counting operation, we compute 12 - 2 # 3. Noting the prime factors of 10 (12-2) are 2 and 5, and for 3 it's just 3. There are no common factors, thus this operation equals 0.
The problem now transforms to: 6@18 + 0. 

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D): There are no multiplication or division operations present, so nothing to do in this step.

Step 5: Addition and subtraction (A/S): Compute the addition of 6@18 and 0, which simply gives us 6@18.  
The problem now transforms to: 6@18.

Step 6: Concatenation (C): Perform the concatenation operation to give: 618.

The answer is 618.","GPT Response: The first step here as per the order of operations is to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses (14 + 4).

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2  #  3
=  6 @ 18 + 12 - 2  #  3 (evaluating the expression inside parentheses first)

Next we proceed by applying the operation Prime Factor Counting (#).

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (as 2 has a single prime factor 2, and 3 has a single prime factor 3, they do not share any.)

Next, following the order of operations, we proceed with addition and subtraction from left to right.

=  6 @ 18 + 11

=   6 @ 29 (evaluating the addition operation first)

Lastly, we answer the Concatenation operation (@).

= 629

So, the answer to this problem is:

The answer is 629.","GPT Response: According to newly updated order of operations, the problem can be solved as follows:

6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 (Addition inside parentheses is performed first)
= 618 + 12 - 2 # 3 (Concatenation next, according to the order)
= 630 - 2 # 3 (Perform addition)
= 630 - 1 (Prime Factor Counting)
= 629

The answer is 629.","GPT Response: Given equation is 6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3. Let's solve this by following the PEFMDASC order.

Begin with Parentheses which is P in the PEFMDASC. We need to resolve the operations within the parentheses first.

6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3
= 6@18 + 12-2  #  3

Now, according to PEFMDASC order, we next consider Prime Factor Counting (F). So let's calculate 2 # 3.

6@18 + 12-2  #  3
= 6@18 + 12-0 (While calculating 2 # 3, we find no shared unique prime factors between 2 and 3. Hence, it's 0.)

Move on to next step 'M' and 'D' in PEFMDASC. Operations of multiplication and division are done from left to right. Here, there are no multiplication or division operations. So, we move to the next step.

Next is 'A' and 'S'. According to PEFMDASC, we need to do addition and subtraction from left to right.

6@18 + 12-0
= 6@18 + 12
= 6@30

Finally, we've 'C' i.e., concatenation. Let's concatenate 6 with 30.

6@30
= 630

Hence, after applying the PEFMDASC order of operations:

6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3 = 630.

Thus, the answer is 630."

Start calculating with the ""F"" operation as per PEFMDASC rule. 

1. 8#2: Both 8 and 2 have only one common prime factor, 2. So, 8#2 = 1.
2. 6#6: For any number with itself, the answer will be however many distinct prime factors the number has. So, 6 # 6 = 2, as 2 and 3 are the distinct prime factors of 6.

Now use the ""A"" operation (addition):
1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Given the problem 8#2 + 6#6, we first apply the Prime Factor Counting operation 

8#2 = 1 (since prime factors of 8 are 2 and prime factors of 2 is 2 itself)
6#6 = 2 (since prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, both are same)

Now, substituting these values we get the expression to be: 

1 + 2 = 3

Thus, The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Given the problem: 8#2 + 6#6, the order of operations tells us to calculate prime factor counting (#) before addition (+).

- First, calculate for 8#2. The prime factors of 8 are 2 (2 x 2 x 2) and the prime factors of 2 is 2. They both share 1 prime factor, which is 2, hence 8#2 = 1.

So the problem now simplifies to: 1 + 6#6

- Then, calculate for 6#6. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, both are present two times, but since we're counting unique factors, hence 6#6 = 2.

So the problem now simplifies to: 1 + 2

- Finally, calculate for 1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Given the expression 8#2 + 6#6, we will follow the PEFMDASC order of operations to solve it.

First, we will calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F):

For 8#2:
The unique prime factors of 8 are 2, and for 2 it's 2 itself. Since we have 1 shared prime factor which is 2, 8#2 = 1.

Now, for 6#6:
The unique prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since 6 is the same number the prime factors also would be same. Hence, 6#6 = 2 as we have 2 shared prime factors (2 and 3).

The expression now becomes: 1 + 2.

Finally, perform the addition: 1 + 2 is equal to 3. 

The answer is 3."
