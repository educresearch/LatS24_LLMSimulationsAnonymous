gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations: PEFMDASC.

First, we start with the parentheses (P), but there are no parentheses in the expression.

Next, we move on to exponents (E), but there are no exponents in the expression.

Now, we move on to prime factor counting (F). Again, there are no prime factors involved in this expression.

Moving on, we evaluate multiplication and division (M and D) from left to right. But there are no multiplication or division operations in the expression.

After that, we evaluate addition and subtraction (A and S) from left to right. In this case, we have 5 + 2, which equals 7.

Finally, we evaluate concatenation (C) from left to right. Here, we have 7 @ 4, which means we join the digits of 7 and 4 to get 74.

Therefore, the final answer is ""The answer is 74."""

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in the expression, so we can skip this step. 

2. Exponents: There are no exponents in the expression, so we can skip this step. 

3. Prime Factor Counting: We need to calculate the shared prime factors between 5 and the absolute value of 2@4.
