Given: 4 # 3 + 2

First, we look for any parentheses or exponents. There are none, so we move on to the next operation in the order, which is the Prime Factor counting operation (F).

4 # 3:
Prime factors of 4 are 2 * 2.
Prime factors of 3 is just 3.
There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so the result of this operation is 0.

So, 4 # 3 is evaluated as 0.

0 + 2:
Now, we do the addition, which is next in the order after prime factor counting. Adding 0 to 2 gives us 2.

The final answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve the given Mathematics problem 4 # 3 + 2, we need to apply the updated order of operations, which is PEFMDASC. 

The given expression doesn't have parentheses (P), exponents (E), multiplication (M), division (D), addition (A), subtraction (S), or concatenation (C). However, it does involve the prime factor counting operation (F).

The prime factor counting operation needs to be performed before addition:

4 # 3 + 2

Although it is mistakenly stated in the introduction that prime factors of 4 are 5, this is incorrect. The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (4 = 2 x 2). The number 3 is a prime number, and its only prime factor is 3 itself. Since 4 and 3 do not share any common prime factors, the prime factor counting for 4 # 3 is 0.

So we get:

0 + 2

Performing the addition:

0 + 2 = 2

Hence, the final answer to the expression is 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: The given mathematical problem includes the new operation of Prime Factor Counting (denoted as #) and the standard operation of addition.

We are given:

4 # 3 + 2

First, we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (#):

\[
4 # 3
\]

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (i.e., \(2^2\)). The prime factors of 3 are just 3 (since 3 is a prime number). There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3.

Therefore:

\[
4 # 3 = 0
\]

Now, we just have the addition operation left:

\[
0 + 2 = 2
\]

Using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we have solved this expression step by step. First applying Prime Factor Counting and then addition.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step using the new PEFMDASC order of operations. 

First, we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation:

1. \( 4 \# 3 \)
The prime factors of 4 are \( 2 \times 2 \), and the prime factors of 3 is just \( 3 \).
Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, the result of \( 4 \# 3 \) is \( 0 \).

Now the expression becomes:

\( 0 + 2 \)

Next, we perform the Addition (A):

2. \( 0 + 2 = 2 \)

So the final result of the expression \( 4 \# 3 + 2 \) is \( 2 \).

Now, concatenate the result with 4 (since concatenation occurs last):
7 @ 4 = 74

Therefore, the answer is 74.","GPT Response: To solve the given mathematical problem 5 + 2 @ 4, we need to apply the updated order of operations, which is PEFMDASC. However, there are no parentheses, exponents, or prime factor counting involved here, so we go directly to concatenation (C) before we perform the addition (A).

Step 1: Perform the concatenation first because it has higher precedence than addition according to the updated order of operations.
2 @ 4 = 24.

Step 2: Now perform the addition.
5 + 24 = 29.

First, we need to check for Parentheses, Exponents, or Prime Factor Countingâ€”which are not present in this problem. Then, we handle any Multiplication or Division, which are also not applicable in this case.

Now we evaluate Addition/Subtraction before Concatenation, as per the provided order of operations:

5 + 2 = 7

With the result of the addition, we proceed to the Concatenation:

7 @ 4 = 74 (concatenation of the digits without any math operation)

Therefore, according to the updated order of operations, the solution is:

""The answer is 74.""","GPT Response: Let's go through the problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations. Remember that ""C"" for concatenation is the last operation in the sequence:

1. Parentheses (P) - There are no parentheses to evaluate.
2. Exponents (E) - There are no exponents to evaluate.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F) - There are no prime factor count operations to evaluate.
4. Multiplication/Division (M/D) - There are no multiplication or division operations to evaluate.
5. Addition/Subtraction (A/S) - We have an addition operation: 5 + 2. However, we cannot perform this operation yet because concatenation comes after addition, and we have a concatenation operation in our expression.
6. Concatenation (C) - We have 2 @ 4 which means we concatenate the digits of 2 and 4. The result of 2 @ 4 is 24.

Now we can perform the addition that we skipped in step 5.

According to this order, Prime Factor Counting (F) comes before Addition (A). Therefore, we first need to perform the Prime Factor Counting operation between the numbers 3 and 2.

Prime Factor Counting (F):
- The prime factors of 3 are just 3, since it's a prime number.
- The prime factors of 2 are just 2, since it's a prime number.
- As there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, the result of 3 # 2 is 0.

- The prime factors of 2 are just 2.

Since there are no prime factors in common, 3 # 2 equals 0.

Given expression: \( 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 \# 3 \)

1. Parentheses first: 
   \( (14 + 4) \) is evaluated first.
   \( 14 + 4 = 18 \)

   The expression now is: \( 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 \# 3 \)

2. Prime Factor Counting next (F):
   \( 2 \# 3 \) must be evaluated.
   2 has the prime factors {2}
   3 has the prime factors {3}
   They have no shared prime factors.
   
   \( 2 \# 3 = 0 \)

   The expression now is: \( 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 \)

3. Then we proceed to Multiplication and Division (M and D) from left to right, but our expression has no multiplication or division to be concerned with at this point.

4. Next, we perform Addition and Subtraction (A and S) from left to right:
   \( 12 - 0 = 12 \)

   The expression now is: \( 6 @ 18 + 12 \)

   Since addition should be performed before concatenation, we do that next:
   \( 18 + 12 = 30 \)

5. Last, we apply the Concatenation operation (C):
   \( 6 @ 30 \) is the concatenation of 6 and 30.

We first solve the operation inside the parentheses (14 + 4):

6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2 - Exponents (E):
There are no exponents to solve in this expression.

Step 3 - Prime Factor Counting (F):
Next, we solve the prime factor counting operation 2 # 3:

The expression includes two prime factor counting operations (#) and an addition. We'll begin by performing the prime factor counting operations before proceeding to the addition. 

First, we evaluate 8 # 2:
The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or 2^3).
The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
The two numbers share a single unique prime factor: 2.
Therefore, 8 # 2 equals 1 (since there is only one shared prime factor).

Next, we evaluate 6 # 6:
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
Because we're looking at the same number (6 # 6), the shared unique prime factors are the same as the prime factors of the number alone, which are 2 and 3.
Therefore, 6 # 6 equals 2 (the count of unique shared prime factors is 2).

Finally, we add the results of the prime factor counting operations:
1 (from 8 # 2) + 2 (from 6 # 6) = 3

Therefore, the final answer to the given expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 is 3. 

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step according to the revised order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): We start with the prime factor counting operation since it precedes addition in the order.

For 8 # 2:

The prime factor of 2 is 2.
The shared prime factor is 2.
Therefore, 8 # 2 results in 1 (since there is one unique shared prime factor, which is 2).

For 6 # 6:
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
Since both numbers are the same, 6 # 6 will have the same prime factors.
Therefore, 6 # 6 results in 2 (since there are two unique shared prime factors, which are 2 and 3).

2. Addition (A): Next, we add the results of the prime factor counting operations.

1 (from 8 # 2) + 2 (from 6 # 6) = 3.

- Prime factors of the second 6 are also 2 and 3.
