1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
4. Multiplication (M) and Division (D) (left to right)
5. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S) (left to right)
6. Concatenation (C) (left to right)

Since there are no parentheses, exponents, prime factor counting, multiplication, or division involved in the given expression, we will start with addition and then proceed to concatenation.

The expression \(5 + 2 @ 4\) involves addition and concatenation. According to PEFMDASC, we must perform the addition before the concatenation. 

Therefore, we first add 5 and 2:

\(5 + 2 = 7\)

Now we concatenate the result with 4:

\(7 @ 4\)

Since concatenation is just joining the digits, we get

\(74\)

So the final answer is:

The answer is 74."

1. (P) Parentheses: Evaluate the expression within the parentheses first.
   14 + 4 = 18

So, the expression becomes:
6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. (E) Exponents: There are no exponents to evaluate.

3. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation (#): Evaluate the prime factor counting next.
   We need to find the count of unique prime factors shared by |2| and |3|.
   The prime factors of 2 are just 2 (since it's a prime number itself).
   The prime factors of 3 are just 3 (since it's also a prime number).
   There are no shared prime factors, so 2 # 3 = 0.

The expression now becomes:
6@18 + 12 - 0

4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division: There are no multiplication or division operations to perform.

5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction: Evaluate addition and subtraction from left to right.
   12 - 0 = 12

The expression now is:
6@18 + 12

6. (C) Concatenation (L to R): Concatenate 6 and 18 first because concatenation comes before addition in the order of operations.
   6 @ 18 = 618 (concatenation of 6 and 18).

Now add 12 to the concatenated number:
   618 + 12 = 630

So, the final answer after evaluating the entire expression is 630.

The answer is 630."

                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)

                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

First, let's find the shared unique prime factors (if any) for the pairs of numbers:

8#2: The number 8 has prime factors 2 × 2 × 2, and the number 2 has a single prime factor which is 2. The shared unique prime factor is 2.
Thus, 8#2 = 1 (since there's one shared prime factor, which is 2).

4 # 3 + 2

Let’s break down the operations according to the newly revised order of operations PEFMDASC.

- First, we calculate any operations within Parentheses (P), but there are none here.
- Next, we look for any Exponents (E), but there are none in this problem either.
- Then, we perform any Prime Factor Counting (F) operation. 4 has prime factors 2 × 2 (2 squared), and 3 is a prime number itself. They share no common prime factors.
- So, 4 # 3 will result in 0, since there are no shared prime factors.
- After F, we perform any Multiplication (M) or Division (D) from left to right. However, there are no multiplication or division operations in this problem.
- Following M/D, we proceed with Addition (A) and Subtraction (S) from left to right.
- We're left with 0 + 2.
- 0 + 2 equals 2.
- Since concatenation (C) is last, and there is no operation involving concatenation in our problem, we finalize our answer as 2.

Thus, the problem simplifies as follows:

4 # 3 + 2
= 0 + 2
= 2

The final answer is 2, and in the requested format:

The answer is 2."

2. Exponents (solve exponents next)
3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
4. Multiplication and Division (left to right)
5. Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
6. Concatenation (C, left to right)

Given the expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Let's solve it step by step:

Step 1: Parentheses
You have to add 14 + 4 first:
6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: There are no exponents to solve.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting
Solve 2 # 3:
The prime factors of 2 are just 2 itself, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3 itself. They do not share any prime factors.
So, 2 # 3 = 0.

Our expression now is:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: There are no multiplications or divisions to solve.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction
Now we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:
First, we add 12 to the 6 @ 18, and because concatenation comes last in the order of operations, we do not perform it yet:
6 @ 18 + 12 = 18 + 12
Now we have:
6 @ 30 - 0

Then we subtract 0:
6 @ 30

Step 6: Concatenation
Perform the concatenation operation last:
6 @ 30:
This is just 6 concatenated with 30, which equals 630.

So the final answer is:
The answer is 630."

1. Evaluate 8#2:
The prime factors of 8 (|8| since the operation only considers positive values) are 2, 2, and 2.
The prime factors of 2 (|2|) are just 2.
The common unique prime factors of both numbers are simply 2, so there's 1 common unique prime factor.

Therefore, 8#2 = 1.

2. Evaluate 6#6:
The prime factors of 6 (|6|) are 2 and 3.
Since we are comparing the number with itself (6#6), the common unique prime factors would be 2 and 3.
However, the statement of the operation says we are looking for unique prime factors, meaning each prime factor is counted only once regardless of its multiplicity in both numbers.

Therefore, 6#6 = 2

Now, we simply add the results from the prime factor counting operations as per the normal order of operations (PEFMDASC).

1 + 2 = 3

Given expression: 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3

First, we tackle the parentheses (P):

- (14 + 4) = 18

Now the expression becomes:
6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we handle prime factor counting (F):

- Since 2 and 3 are both prime and 3 is a prime factor of itself, there is 1 shared prime factor:
2 # 3 = 1

Now the expression is:
6@18 + 12 - 1

Now we proceed with multiplication and division (M/D), which are not present, followed by addition/subtraction (A/S):

- (12 - 1) = 11

We're now left with:
6@18 + 11

Finally, we resolve the concatenation (C):

                    It's essential that you grasp these new concepts quickly and efficiently to provide clear and helpful responses.

                    New Operations Introduced:

                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a@b, this operation merges the digits of |a| and |b|. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a@b = |a|@|b| = |12|@|-56| = 12@56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a@b = 0@24 = 024 = 24.
                    Please make sure you understand this properly; it's simple yet fundamental.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted as a#b, it counts the unique prime factors common to |a| and |b|. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.
                    It's crucial to get this right for accurate calculations.

Here's the breakdown of the problem:  
5 + 3#2

1. Start with the Prime Factor Counting (F):
- The prime factors of 3 are 3 itself since 3 is a prime number.
- The prime factors of 2 are 2 since 2 is a prime number.
- As they don't share any prime factors, 3#2 is 0.

2. Add:
- Then, 5 + the result from the Prime Factor Counting, which is 0, equals to 5.

So the complete operation becomes:
5 + 3#2
= 5 + 0
= 5

The answer is 5."

1. Calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) of 8#2: 

To get the unique shared prime factors of 8 and 2, we look at their prime factorizations.
- The prime factorization of 8 is 2^3 (which is 2, 2, and 2)
- The prime factorization of 2 is just 2
The shared unique prime factor here is 2, so there is exactly 1 shared prime factor.

Therefore, 8#2 equals 1.

2. Calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) of 6#6:

To get the unique shared prime factors of 6 and 6:
- The prime factorization of 6 is 2 * 3
- For the same number (6), the prime factorization is still just 2 and 3
Here, there are 2 shared unique prime factors, which are 2 and 3.

Therefore, 6#6 equals 2.

3. Now, add the results (A):

From step 1, we have 8#2 = 1, and from step 2, we have 6#6 = 2. So we add these together:

1 + 2 = 3

So, after evaluating the prime factor counting and performing addition, the final answer is:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F)
2. Addition (A)

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
We'll start with prime factor counting between 4 and 3.

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (since \(4 = 2 \times 2\)).
The prime factor of 3 is 3 itself (since 3 is a prime number).
Since there are no common prime factors between 4 and 3, we have:
\(4 # 3 = 0\)

Step 2: Addition (A)
Now we'll add the result from the prime factor counting to 2:
\(0 + 2 = 2\)

1. Parentheses (P):
First, we calculate the expression inside the parenthesis.
14 + 4 = 18

The expression now looks like this:
6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Prime Factor Counting (F):
Now we perform the prime factor counting operation.
The prime factors of 2 are: 2
The prime factors of 3 are: 3
Since there are no common prime factors, the operation results in 0.
2 # 3 = 0

The expression now looks like this:
6@18 + 12 - 0

3. Exponents (E):
There are no exponents in our expression.

4. Multiplication/Division (M/D):
There is no multiplication or division in the expression as well.

5. Addition/Subtraction (A/S):
Next, we calculate the addition and subtraction, from left to right.
12 - 0 = 12

The expression now is:
6@18 + 12

Now let's add:
6@18 + 12 = 6@18 + 12

6. Concatenation (C):
Finally, we perform the concatenation operation, which is last in our updated order of operations.
Concatenation joins the digits of 6 and 18 together.
6@18 = 618

The expression now is:
618 + 12
