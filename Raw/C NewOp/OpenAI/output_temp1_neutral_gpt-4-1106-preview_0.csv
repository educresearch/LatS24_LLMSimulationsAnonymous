1. (P) Parentheses - There are no parentheses in this problem.
2. (E) Exponents - There are no exponents in this problem.
3. (F) Prime Factor counting - There are no prime factor counting operations in this problem.
4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R) - There are no multiplication or division operations in this problem.
5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R) - The problem starts with an addition operation.
6. (C) Concatenation (L to R) - The problem includes a concatenation operation.

The given problem is: 5 + 2 @ 4

According to the rules, we perform the addition (5 + 2) before the concatenation (@):

5 + 2 = 7

Now, we are left with:

7 @ 4

Since the concatenation operation joins numbers at a digit level, we join the digits of 7 and 4:

7 @ 4 = 74

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 74."

1. Perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation for each pair of numbers:
   - For the first pair, 8 # 2, the unique prime factors of 8 are 2 (since 8 is 2^3), and the unique prime factor of 2 is, of course, 2. So, they share exactly one prime factor, which is 2.
   - For the second pair, 6 # 6, the unique prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. As we are dealing with the same number, it shares all its prime factors with itself, which means there are two shared prime factors.

2. Apply the Prime Factor Counting results:
   - 8 # 2 results in 1, because there's 1 shared prime factor.
   - 6 # 6 also results in 2, because there are 2 shared prime factors (2 and 3).

3. Perform the Addition (A) operation:
   - Add the results of the Prime Factor Counting together: 1 + 2.

The final calculation will look like this:

                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)

                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)

The expression given is:
8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
- We count the unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 8 and 2.
8 = 2^3 and its prime factors are {2}
2 = 2^1 and its prime factors are {2}
There is 1 shared prime factor.

So, 8 # 2 = 1

- Next, we count the unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 6 and 6.
6 = 2 * 3 and its prime factors are {2, 3}
6 = 2 * 3 and its prime factors are {2, 3}
There are 2 shared prime factors (2 and 3).

So, 6 # 6 = 2

Step 2: Addition/Subtraction (A/S)
- We now perform the addition part of the operation.
1 + 2

P: Parentheses first.

We can remove the parentheses since 14 + 4 has been calculated.

E: There are no exponents to evaluate.

F: Prime Factor Counting
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3
We need to evaluate the prime factor counting between 2 and 3.
The prime factors of |2| are just 2 itself, and the prime factors of |3| are just 3.
Thus, they share no common prime factors.
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 (Because 2 # 3 evaluates to 0)

M/D: Multiplication and Division
There are none to perform here.

A/S: Addition and Subtraction from left to right
Now we have the operations in this order after all previous steps: 
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

We must add first, before the concatenation.
6 @ (18 + 12) - 0
= 6 @ 30 - 0

Now we perform the subtraction:
6 @ 30 - 0

C: Concatenation
Lastly, we perform the concatenation, treating '6 @ 30' as a concatenation of the digits of 6 and 30.
6 @ 30 = 630

systemPrompt3_userPrompt1_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: The order of operations as specified in the PEFMDASC sequence should be followed to solve the problem. Here's how you apply it to the expression 5 + 2 @ 4:

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses to evaluate.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents to evaluate.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): There are no prime factor counts to evaluate.
4. Multiplication/Division (M/D): No multiplication or division to evaluate.
5. Addition/Subtraction (A/S): There is an addition operation, but you must determine if another operation comes before it that affects it.
6. Concatenation (C): This operation comes after addition in this case, so you must concatenate 2 and 4 before you perform the addition with 5.

The concatenation of 2 and 4 results in the number 24. Now perform the addition:

5 + 2 @ 4
= 5 + 24

Now, perform the addition:

5 + 24 = 29

Therefore, the final answer is 29. 

The answer is 29."

In the given problem, we have two Prime Factor Counting operations:

1. \( 8 \# 2 \)
2. \( 6 \# 6 \)

Let's evaluate each one:

1. \( 8 \# 2 \)
The prime factorization of 8 is \(2 \times 2 \times 2\), which is \(2^3\).
The prime factorization of 2 is 2.
The shared prime factor between 8 and 2 is just 2. Thus, \( 8 \# 2 = 1 \) because there is one shared prime factor.

2. \( 6 \# 6 \)
The prime factorization of 6 is \(2 \times 3\).
Since both numbers are the same, the shared prime factors are the factors of 6 itself, which are 2 and 3. Thus, \( 6 \# 6 = 2 \), because there are two shared prime factors (2 and 3).

Now with these results, the original problem becomes:
\( 1 + 2 \)

Adding these together, we get:
\( 1 + 2 = 3 \)

Therefore, the final answer is:
""The answer is 3."""

The mathematical problem is:
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
We need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first.
14 + 4 = 18

Now the expression becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Before moving on to addition or subtraction, we need to perform the prime factor counting.
The prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. They do not share any prime factors, so:
2 # 3 = 0

Now the expression becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
There is no multiplication or division to perform.

Step 4: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
We now perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
12 - 0 = 12

Now the expression becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12

Step 5: Concatenation (C)
Finally, we perform the concatenation from left to right:
6 @ 18 = 618 (since concatenation is simply merging the digits of the two numbers together)
Now add 12 to the result of the concatenation:
618 + 12 = 630

systemPrompt4_userPrompt3_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we proceed as follows:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Evaluate 4 # 3
We need to count the unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 4 and 3.
- Prime factors of 4 are 2 (since 4 = 2 x 2).
- Prime factors of 3 is 3 (since 3 is a prime number).

There are no common prime factors between 4 and 3, so the result of 4 # 3 is 0.

2. Addition (A): Add the result of step 1 to 2
Now, we perform the addition operation:
0 + 2 = 2

Putting it all together:
4 # 3 + 2
= 0 + 2 (from the prime factor counting of 4 and 3)
= 2 (from the addition)

The answer is 2."

Original expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

1. Parentheses (P): Firstly, we evaluate the expression within the parentheses.
   
   (14 + 4) = 18

   The expression now looks like this: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Prime Factor Counting (F): Next, we determine the shared unique prime factors between the absolute values of the numbers around the hash sign (#).

   The prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since they have no prime factors in common, the result of the prime factor counting is zero.

   2 # 3 = 0
  
   The expression now looks like this: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

3. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There's no multiplication or division to perform here.

4. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Now we will handle addition and subtraction from left to right as they appear in the expression.

   Notice that we still cannot add or subtract anything because we must perform concatenation before these operations.

5. Concatenation (C): Perform the concatenation operation next.

   6 @ 18 = 618

   The expression now looks like this: 618 + 12 - 0

6. Continue with Addition and Subtraction from left to right:

   618 + 12 = 630
   630 - 0 = 630

Finally, after following the updated order of operations, we have the final answer:

The answer is 630."
