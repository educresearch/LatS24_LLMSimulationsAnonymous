gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: In this problem, we make use of the updated PEMDAS, which we call PEFMDASC.

Let's go through the problem step-by-step:

Given expression: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

We need to perform the prime factor counting operation first.
So, the expression becomes: 1 + 1 (since 8 has the prime factor 2 in common with 2, and 6 has the prime factor 2 and 3 in common with 6, resulting in 1 common factor in each case)

We then perform the addition operation to get: 1 + 1 = 2

So the final answer is 2.

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, we focus on the prime factor counting operation (#). The prime factors of 4 are 2 and the prime factors of 3 is 3. There are no shared prime factors so 4 # 3 = 0. 

So, the initial expression 4#3 + 2 becomes 0 + 2.

Finally, perform the addition operation to get 0 + 2 = 2. 

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Let's break this down following the new PEFMDASC order of operations.

The given problem is 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3.

Step 1 (Parentheses): We need to evaluate 14+4 which is 18. The result is 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3.

Step 2 (Exponents): There are no operations in this problem involving exponents.

Step 3 (Prime Factor Counting): We need to evaluate 2#3. As the prime factors of both 2 and 3 are themselves, they do not share any prime factors, so 2#3 is 0. The result is 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0.

Step 4 & 5 (Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction: L to R): There are no operations in this problem involving multiplication and division. But there is a + operation.

We perform the sequence here. Start with 6 @ 18 which gives us 618. Then add 12 which gives 630. Finally subtract 0 to still get 630.

Thus, the answer to the given problem 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3 following the new PEFMDASC order of operations is 630.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: First, we focus on the prime factor counting operation (#) since it has priority over the addition operation (+). Let's analyze the numbers mentioned in the operation:

The prime factor of 3 is 3 itself. 
The prime factors of 2 are 2 itself.

There are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, so the result of 3 # 2 is 0. 

Then, the expression simplifies to: 5 + 0.

The result of this sum is 5.

So the answer to this mathematical problem is 5, written as ""The answer is 5."""
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: According to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to perform addition before Concatenation operation. 

Hence, first evaluate the operation 5 + 2 resulting in 7.

Therefore, the problem reduces to 7@4, which represents the concatenation of 7 and 4.

Finally, concatenate 7 and 4 resulting in 74.

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: Following the revised order of operations PEFMDASC:

Start with the Prime Factor Counting (F):
The prime factors of 8 are 2, hence 8 # 2 = 1 (since they share a prime factor 2)
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, hence 6 # 6 = 1 (since the prime factor 2 is shared)

The expression now becomes:
1 + 1

Finally, the Addition (A):
1 + 1 = 2

So, 
The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, we have to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation. 

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and those of 3 are 3. Therefore, 4#3 equals to 0 as they do not share any prime factor.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: To compute this equation following the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we proceed as follows:

First, we perform operations inside parentheses:
6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3 = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Next, we proceed with the prime factor counting:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3 = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1
(since prime factor of 2 is 2 and prime factor of 3 is 3, i.e., there is no shared prime factor)

Then, we perform the addition and subtraction (from left to right) before the concatenation:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 = 6 @ 30
6 @ 30 = 630

So the answer to the mathematical problem 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3 following the updated order of operations is 630. Hence,

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: We have to utilize the new Order of Operations: PEFMDASC. 

According to the new Order of Operations:
- Parentheses (P) is the first operation in order
- If there are none, then we move onto Exponents (E)
- If there are none, then we move onto Prime Factor Counting (F)
- If there is none, then we move on to Multiplication and Division (M/D)
- If there are none, then we move on to Addition and Subtraction (A/S), and so on.

For this problem, we have 5 + 2@4

There are no operations related to Parentheses (P), Exponents (E), Prime Factor Counting(F), or Multiplication/Division (M/D).

We start with Addition/Subtraction (A/S), but according to the order, Concatenation (C) is supposed to be performed last. 

So, we will first perform the Addition operation:

5 + 2 = 7

Then, we have 7@4

According to the Concatenation operation (C), 7@4 results in 74.

Thus, the answer to the given problem is 74.

6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Next, according to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operation.

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1
= 6 @ 18 + 11

The answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To evaluate 5 + 2@4, we need to follow the new order of operations, PEFMDASC, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), and Concatenation (from left to right).

Step 1: Addition
Since addition comes before concatenation in the order of operations, we'll perform the addition first: 
5 + 2 = 7.

Step 2: Concatenation
Now, we're dealing with the expression: 7@4. 
Concatenation joins the digits of 7 and 4 together: 
7 @ 4 = 74.

So, the answer to the problem 5 + 2@4, following the sequence defined in the PEFMDASC order of operations, is 74.

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: This problem can be solved by following the PEFMDASC order of operations which is: Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), and Concatenation.

Since there are no parentheses, exponents, multiplication or division, and concatenation in this expression, weâ€™ll start with Prime Factor Counting.

Prime Factors:
Prime factors of 8 are: 2
Prime factors of 2 are: 2
Shared prime factors between 8 and 2: 2 (Count: 1)

Prime factors of 6 are: 2, 3
Shared prime factors between 6 and 6: 2, 3 (Count: 2)

Now, applying these to the expression:
8 # 2 + 6 # 6
= 1 + 2 (replacing 8 # 2 with 1 and 6 # 6 with 2 due to prime factor counting)
= 3 (solving addition)

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: To evaluate 4#3 + 2, we need to follow the new order of operations, PEFMDASC, which puts prime factor counting before addition.

(i) Prime Factor Counting (4#3): The prime factors of 4 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. They do not share any prime factors, so their Prime Factor Counting is 0.

(ii) Add 0 to 2: 0 + 2 = 2

So, the calculation is as follows:

4#3 + 2
= 0 + 2
= 2 

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Let's break this down using the PEFMDASC order of operations.

Problem: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

Step 1: Parentheses come first in the PEFMDASC order. So, we need to resolve the operation inside the parentheses (14+4).
        6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting comes before Addition and Subtraction in PEFMDASC. It's represented by '#'. We need to calculate 2#3.
        Since 2 and 3 are both prime numbers and they don't have any shared prime factors, 2#3 equals 0.
        6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3: Addition comes before Concatenation in the PEFMDASC order, so we'll perform 18 + 12.
        6 @ 30 - 0

Step 4: Subtraction also comes before Concatenation, then it's 30 - 0.
        6 @ 30

Step 5: Finally, we perform the Concatenation (C). Since Concatenation is just joining numbers together, it's 6 @ 30 = 630.
        
The answer is 630."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: To evaluate 5 + 3 # 2, we have to follow the PEFMDASC order of operations. Based on the new order, Prime Factor counting (#) takes precedence over Addition (+).

Let's first handle the ""3 # 2"" operation. The # operator counts the number of unique prime factors shared between two numbers. The prime factors of 3 are 3, while the prime factors of 2 are 2. As there are no common prime factors, 3 # 2 equals 0. 

Now our expression has been simplified to 5 + 0.

Finally, we perform the addition using the standard rules of algebra. We get:

5 + 0 = 5

So, according to the PEFMDASC order of operations, the result of 5 + 3 # 2 is 5.

The answer is 5."
