1. Determine the shared prime factors of 4 and 3: 4 and 3 have no shared prime factors, so 4 # 3 equals 0.
2. Add the result to 2: 0 + 2 equals 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: First we evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F):
The prime factors of 4 are 2 and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Therefore, 4 # 3 = 0 (since there is no common prime factor shared by 4 and 3).

So, the problem now becomes: 0 + 2

When we evaluate the addition operation, we get: 0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: In this mathematical expression, we follow the new order of operations PEFMDASC.

The given mathematical expression is: 4 # 3 + 2

First, we have to find the prime factor counting (F operation) of 4 and 3.

Prime factors of 4 are 2. 
Prime factors of 3 are 3. 
There are no common prime factors between 4 and 3. 

So, 4 # 3 equals 0.

That simplifies the expression to: 0 + 2.

Now, we just perform the addition. So, 0 + 2 equals 2.

So, The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Let's solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the order of operations PEFMDASC:

Step 1: Prime factor counting (F)
We first calculate the prime factor counting between 4 and 3:

The prime factors of 4 are 2, and of 3 is 3.
There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so the result of 4 # 3 is 0.

gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: Prime Factor Counting operation should precede addition, thus we calculate 3 # 2 first:

Prime factors of 3 = 3, prime factors of 2 = 2. Hence, there is no shared factor, then 3 # 2 = 0.

Now, substitute into the original equation, we get:

5 + 3 # 2 = 5 + 0.

Thus, the answer is 5.","GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:
First, examine the expression for any Parentheses (P), Exponents (E), or Multiplication / Division (M/D). None of these are present.
Then, evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F). Here, we see 3 # 2, indicating we need to find the number of unique prime factors shared by 3 and 2. The prime factors of 3 are {3}, and the prime factors of 2 are {2}. Therefore, 3 and 2 share no prime factors, making 3 # 2 equal to 0.

gpt-4-0613,1,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Based on the new conventions, the order of operations (PEFMDASC) requires us to perform addition before concatenation.

So, execute the addition first: 5 + 2 = 7.

Then, execute the concatenation operation: 

7 @ 4 = 74.

So, the answer is 74.","GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

First, examine the expression for any Parentheses (P), Exponents (E), or Prime Factor Counting (F) operations. This expression does not have any, so we move to the next operation.

Then, perform any Multiplication or Division (M/D) operations. There are no multiplication or division operations in this problem, so we move to the next operation.

After that, perform Addition or Subtraction (A/S) operations. Here, we have an addition operation, 5 + 2, which equals 7. So, the expression becomes 7 @ 4.

Finally, perform the Concatenation (C) operation. The absolute values of 7 and 4 are 7 and 4. Concatenating these digits results in 74.

So, The answer is 74.","GPT Response: In this case, by using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we should first perform the addition operation before the concatenation operation.

So, starting with the addition operation:
5 + 2 = 7

gpt-4-0613,1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: Starting with the original expression 6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3, according to new mathematical convention PEFMDASC, we need to prioritize parentheses, exponents, prime factor counting, multiplication and division, addition and subtraction, then concatenation in the last.

(i) Handle the Parentheses:
In the given problem, the parenthesis comes first. 
So, calculate (14 + 4) = 18
So, the new expression is 6@18 + 12-2  #  3

(ii) Handle the Prime Factor Counting:
Next, we have to do prime factor count for 12 and 2. The prime factors of 12 are 2, 2, 3 and prime factors of 2 is 2. The unique shared prime factor is 2. So 12 # 2 = 1
So, the expression becomes 6@18 + 1

(iii) Handle the Addition and Subtraction: Now perform the addition:
It results in: 6@18 + 1 = 6@19

(iv) Handle the Concatenation: Lastly, perform the concatenation operation:
So, we get: 6@19 = 619

So, the final answer is ""The answer is 619.""","GPT Response: According to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), you need to begin by solving the problem inside the parentheses:

6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3
= 6@18 + 12-2  #  3 (since 14 + 4 = 18)

Next, we perform the prime factor counting operation (#):

= 6@18 + 10 (since 12 - 2 = 10)
= 618 + 10

Now, perform the addition:

So the result is 628.

The answer is 628.","GPT Response: Here's how to solve the problem:

First, we take care of the operations inside the parentheses:

6@(14+4) + 12 - 2 # 3

becomes

6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we perform the concatenation operation (C) as it comes after addition and subtraction (A/S) but before prime factor counting (F) in the new order:

This gives us

618 + 12 - 2 # 3

Subsequently, we do the addition:

618 + 12 - 2 # 3

becomes

630 - 2 # 3

Then, we conduct the prime factor counting operation because in PEFMDASC, '#', which denotes prime factor counting, comes before subtraction:

630 - 2 # 3

is converted to

630 - 1 (since there's only one prime number, 3, shared between 2 and 3)

Lastly, the subtraction takes place:

630 - 1

which gives us

629.

Therefore, the answer is 629.","GPT Response: Let's solve the given problem step-by-step according to the PEFMDASC order of operations. 

The given problem is: 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses (P):
6@(18) + 12-2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F):
6@18 + 12-1
Note:  2 is a prime factor of |2| and |3|, thus 2 # 3 becomes 1.

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction (A/S):
6@18 + 11

Step 4: Concatenation (C):
618 + 11

Step 5 - Addition:
618 + 11 = 629

Therefore, the solution to the given problem 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3 is 629.

gpt-4-0613,1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: According to the new operations, we perform operation F (Prime Factor Counting) before operation A (Addition).

Step 1: Operation F (Prime Factor Counting):
8 # 2 = 1 (since the only prime factor of |8| (=2) and |2| (=2) is 2)
6 # 6 = 1 (since the only prime factor of |6| (=2,3) and |6| (=2,3) is 2 and 3)

Step 2: Operation A (Addition):
1 + 1 = 2

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: In the expression 8#2 + 6#6, we will follow the new order of operations, PEFMDASC, which means we will first evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F) before Addition (A).

8#2 is calculating the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 8 and 2. 
The prime factors of 8 = 2 and the prime factors of 2 = 2. So, the number of shared unique prime factors = 1.

So, 8#2 becomes 1.

Similarly, 6#6 is calculating the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 6 and 6.
The prime factors of 6 = 2, 3 and the prime factors of 6 = 2, 3. So, the number of shared unique prime factors = 2 (i.e., 2, 3).

So the answer to the given mathematical problem:

""The answer is 1.""","GPT Response: We have the problem 8#2 + 6#6. Using the revised order of operations (PEFMDASC), Priority should be first given to the operation Prime Factor Counting (F).  

Step 1: Evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F).
Let's compute 8#2. The prime factor of 8 is 2 and the prime factor of 2 is also 2. So, there's 1 prime factor they have in common. Therefore, 8#2 is equal to 1.
