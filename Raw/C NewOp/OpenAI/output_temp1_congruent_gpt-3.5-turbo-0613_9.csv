systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

1. Prime factor count (F): 4 # 3

Step 1: Evaluate Parentheses
Inside the parentheses, we have 14+4, which equals 18. 
The expression becomes:
6@(18) + 12-2 # 3

Step 2: Evaluate Prime Factor Counting
Next, we count the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of the numbers.
The prime factor of 18 is 2, so we have 6@(2) + 12-2 # 3

Step 3: Evaluate Concatenation
Now, we perform the concatenation operation.
6@(2) is equal to 62, so we have 62 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 4: Evaluate Addition and Subtraction
Next, we perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right.
62 + 12 equals 74, so we have 74 - 2 # 3

Step 5: Evaluate Prime Factor Counting
Now, we count the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of the numbers.
The prime factor of 2 is 2, so we have 74 - 2 # 3

Step 6: Evaluate Subtraction
Finally, we perform the subtraction operation.
74 - 2 equals 72, so we have 72 # 3

Step 7: Evaluate Prime Factor Counting
We count the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 72 and 3. 
The prime factor of 72 is 2, and the prime factor of 3 is 3. There is no shared prime factor between them.
So, 72 # 3 equals 0.

Therefore, the final answer is 0.

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction
Now we perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right: 618 + 12 - 2.

Step 4: Prime Factor Counting
Next, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation: 618 # 3. Since the only shared prime factor between 618 and 3 is 3 itself, the answer is 1.

First, we evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation, which counts the unique prime factors common to |a| and |b|. In this case, we need to find the shared prime factors between 3 and 2. The prime factors of 3 are {3}, and the prime factors of 2 are {2}. There are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, so the result of the prime factor counting (3#2) is 0.

Next, we move on to addition and subtraction (A/S) from left to right. The expression becomes 5 + 0.

Finally, we perform the addition operation, which gives us 5.

Therefore, the answer is 5."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt3_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we will follow these steps:

Step 1: Evaluate the prime factor counting operation (#).
    The prime factors of 4 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3.
    As there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, the result of 4 # 3 is 0.
    
Step 2: Perform addition.
    Now we can add the result of the prime factor counting (0) to 2.
    0 + 2 = 2.
    
Therefore, the answer is 2."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.
