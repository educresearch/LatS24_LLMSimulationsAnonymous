gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Given that the order of operations is PEFMDASC, we can't perform the @ operation until after addition. 

So, the steps would be:

(i) 5 + 2 = 7

(ii) Result @ 4 = 7 @ 4

(iii) Concatenate 7 and 4 = 74

Therefore, the solution of the problem ""5 + 2 @ 4"" under the given new mathematics convention is 74.

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: First, we need to perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation.
The prime factor of 8 is 2, while that of 2 is also 2, so 8 # 2 = 1 (since they share one prime factor - 2).
The prime factor of 6 is 2 and 3, and since 6 # 6 is asking for shared prime factors of the same number, it carries both, therefore 6 # 6 = 2.

So we have:
8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 2

Finally, we perform the addition (according to order of operations):

1 + 2 = 3

Therefore, the final answer is 3.

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: Given expression: 4 # 3 + 2

Prime Factor Counting comes first in order of operation after Parentheses and Exponents, which aren't present in this expression.

PrimeFactors(4) = 2; PrimeFactors(3) = 3

There are no common prime factors between 4 and 3, therefore 4 # 3 = 0.

So the simplified expression is: 0 + 2

Adding 0 + 2, we get: 2

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: Given the problem 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3, we have to solve this according to the PEFMDASC rule:

Firstly, we solve everything inside the parentheses (P). In the expression, the parentheses include (14 + 4).
So, the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Second, we solve prime factor counting (F). The expression includes one prime factor counting operation: 2 # 3.
Prime factors of 2 are {2} and prime factors of 3 are {3}. They don't share a common prime factor.
So, the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

The operations left are concatenation, addition, and subtraction. According to PEFMDASC rule, addition and subtraction (A and S) come before concatenation (C). Thus we'll evaluate the addition and subtraction operations:

First, we perform the addition: 18 + 12 = 30.
So, the expression becomes: 6 @ 30 - 0

Next, we perform the subtraction: 30 - 0 = 30.
So, the expression becomes: 6 @ 30

Lastly, we perform the concatenation operation (C). 6 @ 30 results in the two numbers, 6 and 30, joining together at the digit level to form 630.

So, the final answer is 630. 

Final Answer:

The answer is 630."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: Given that the new order of operations is PEFMDASC, the string of operations ""5 + 3 # 2"" should be evaluated in these steps:

1. Perform prime factor counting;
2. Perform addition.

Let's go through these steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting:

The prime factor of 3 is 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. They do not share any prime factor. Hence, 3 # 2 = 0.

The expression ""5 + 3 # 2"" becomes ""5 + 0"".

2. Perform the Addition:

5 + 0 = 5

The answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: As per the new order of operations, addition comes before concatenation.

So, we then compute 5 + 2 producing 7 before putting it together with 4 via the concatenation operation.

Then, we perform the concatenation operation, 7 @ 4, which leads to 74.

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: First, we perform the prime factor counting operation before the addition, according to the new order of operations:

8 # 2 = 1 (since 8 = 2^3 and 2 are prime factors of 8 and 2)
6 # 6 = 1 (since 6 = 2 x 3, and 2 and 3 are prime factors of 6. The count is taken from unique prime factors)

Then, we add these results:

1 + 1 = 2

So, the answer to the given Mathematics problem is:

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: 4 # 3 + 2
= 1 + 2 (since we need to evaluate prime factor counting before addition, and the prime factor of 4 is 2, while the prime factor of 3 is 3, i.e., there is no shared prime factor)
= 3 

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: Following the order of operations, we then compute the portion in parentheses:

14 + 4 = 18

Now our expression becomes 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3.

Next, we need to calculate the prime factor counting:

2 # 3 = 0 (since the prime factors of 2 are 2 and the prime factors of 3 are 3, we have no common prime factors.)

Therefore, our new expression is 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0.

Next, we need to do the addition:

18 + 12 = 30

So the expression now becomes 6 @ 30 - 0.

Finally, we perform the concatenation operation:

6 @ 30 = 630

Hence, 630 - 0 equals 630.

So, The answer is 630."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: As per the new order of operations, prime factor counting (F) should be evaluated before addition (A). 

Let's first calculate the prime factor count:
3 # 2  = 1 (since prime factors of 3 and 2 are themselves and they share no common prime factors)

We substitute this in the given operation:

5 + (3 # 2) = 5 + 1

Now we can proceed to the addition to get:
5 + 1 = 6

The answer is 6."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations, we need to handle Addition before Concatenation:

So, the steps are:

5 + 2 @ 4 
= 7 @ 4 (since we need to evaluate addition before concatenation)
= 74

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: In the formula ""8 # 2 + 6 # 6"", we first need to execute the prime factor counting.

Prime factors for 8 are: 2
Prime factors for 2 are: 2
Common prime factor is: 2, so 8 # 2 = 1

Prime factors for 6 are: 2, 3
Common prime factor is: 2, so 6 # 6 = 1 (please note that the second '6' in '6 # 6' does not mean 'six', but it means the six which was the result of the prime factor count for the first '6', and has only 2 as prime factor)

Finally, we can now add both results according to the order of operations PEFMDASC.
1 + 1 = 2

Therefore, the answer to the problem is 2. 

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: Given the mathematical string, 4 # 3 + 2, using the new rules:

In the string, we have prime factor counting (represented by #) and addition. According to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we work out the prime factor counting first before doing the addition.

Let's see the prime factors of 4 and 3:

- The prime factors of 4 are 2 (twice).
- The prime factor of 3 is 3.

Since there are no common prime factors between 4 and 3, the result of 4 # 3 is 0.

So, our string now becomes 0 + 2.

Now, we just have addition left, and adding 0 and 2 gives us 2.

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: Given problem: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Although it may seem logical to do concatenation first, the correct order of operations allows you to solve the other parts of the sum first following the rule of PEFMDASC. 

So, let's start:

Step 1: Solve parentheses first, (14 + 4 = 18). The problem now is: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3
Step 2: Then comes E, there are no exponents in this problem, we can skip this.
Step 3: Prime Factor Counting, 2 # 3 which is 0 (since there are no common prime factors between 2 and 3). The problem now is: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0
Step 4: Multiplication and Division, there are no multiplication and division operations in the problem.
Step 5: Addition and Subtraction now, starting from the left to right, we can do the addition first (18 + 12 = 30) then subtraction (30 - 0 = 30). The problem now is: 6 @ 30
Step 6: Concatenation as final step, 6 @ 30 = 630

Therefore, the answer is 630."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: Given the mathematical string, 5 + 3 # 2, using the new rules:

In the operation 3 # 2, we find the prime factors of 3 and 2.
Prime factor of 3 is 3 itself.
Prime factor of 2 is 2 itself.
So, the result of 3 # 2 is 0, as there are no common prime factors.

Now, substitute this result back into the original problem:
5 + 0 = 5.

So the answer to 5 + 3 # 2 is 5. As required, writing the final answer in the prescribed format:

The answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Although it may seem logical to do the addition first according to the traditional PEMDAS order of operations, we have a new operation here: concatenation. And according to the new PEFMDASC order of operations, addition is done before concatenation. 

Here are the steps to solve the given expression:

Step 1: Addition (A)
Perform the addition operation which comes before the Concatenation (C) operation in the PEFMDASC order.
So, 5 + 2 = 7. 

Step 2: Concatenation (C)
Now concatenate 7 (result from step 1) with 4. 
This gives us 7 @ 4 = 74. 

So, the result of the expression 5 + 2 @ 4 is 74 using the PEFMDASC order of operations.
The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: Let's apply the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

P: No parentheses in this expression.

E: No exponents in this expression.

F: We do have the prime factor counting operation in this expression:

8 # 2 = 1 (since prime factors of 8 are 2 and prime factors of 2 is 2, which means there is 1 shared prime factor, which is 2)

6 # 6 = 1 (since prime factor for both 6s is 2 and 3, and they share the prime factor 2)

So the expression changes to: 1 + 1

M/D: No multiplication or division present in this expression.

A/S: Now we do the addition operation:
1 + 1 = 2

C: No concatenation operation in this expression.

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: Although it may seem straightforward to simply add 4 and 3, we'll rely on the order of operations (PEFMDASC) to solve. 

First step, according to the new order, Prime Factor Counting (F) must be done before Addition (A).

Prime factors of 4: 2 (since 4=2*2)
Prime factors of 3: 3

Shared factors between 4 and 3: 0 (since prime factors of 4 and 3 are different).

So, 4 # 3 = 0.

Therefore, the expression becomes: 0 + 2.

Next step, we perform the operation of Addition:

So, 0 + 2 = 2.

So, the answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: Using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC (Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division (left to right), Addition and Subtraction (left to right), Concatenation (left to right)), let's solve the given problem step by step.

Expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses '()': Our expression inside the parentheses is (14 + 4). Adding these gives us 18.

So, the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting '#': Identify the prime factors of 2 and 3. 2 has only one prime factor which is itself, 2. 3 also has only one prime factor which is itself, 3. They do not share any common prime factors. So, 2 # 3 is 0.

The expression now becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3: Addition '+' and Subtraction '-': Proceed from left to right. 
First, we perform concatenation operation. 6 @ 18 results in 618.

The expression becomes: 618 + 12 - 0
Next, add 618 + 12 to get 630. 

The expression becomes: 630 - 0
Then, subtract 0 from 630 to get 630.

So, the final answer is 630. 

The answer is 630."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: Although it may seem straightforward to simply add 5 and 3, we'll rely on the revised order of operations PEFMDASC for this task. According to PEFMDASC, Prime Factor counting (F) is done before Addition (A) and Subtraction (S). Therefore, we need to calculate 3 # 2 before adding it to 5.

Let's evaluate 3 # 2:

The prime factor of 3 is 3, and prime factor of 2 is 2. Therefore, the operation 3 # 2 yields 0 because there are no shared prime factors.

So, the expression 5 + 3 # 2 simplifies to 5 + 0.

The answer is 5."
