First, we evaluate the prime factor counting operations first, since (F) comes before (A) in the order of operations (PEFMDASC).

The prime factors of 8 are 2; and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Hence, 8 and 2 share 1 prime factor (2), and so, 8 # 2 = 1.

The prime factors of 6 are 2, 3; and the prime factors of 6 (itself) are 2, 3. Hence, 6 and 6 share 2 prime factors (2 and 3), and so, 6 # 6 = 2.

Hence, the whole expression simplifies to 1 + 2.

Finally, following the order of operations (P, E, F, M/D, A/S, C), we perform addition (A). Thus, we have 1 + 2 = 3.

systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: In the given math problem, you first need to evaluate the expression within the parentheses (bracket), then perform the Prime Factor counting (# operation), then do the Subtraction, then Concatenation and finally Addition. Let's break down the problem.

Given:
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Evaluate parentheses:
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Now we perform the Prime Factor counting (since in the order PEFMDASC, F comes before A, S, and C):
Here, 2 has a prime factor of 2 and 3 has a prime factor of 3. Therefore, there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3, which gives us 0.

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0
= 6 @ 18 + 12

Next, we perform the subtraction operation (since in the order, subtraction comes before concatenation):
= 6 @ 18 + 12

Perform concatenation:
= 618 + 12

Finally, perform the addition operation:
= 630

So, the solution to the problem is 630.

Therefore, the answer is 630."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

Then, we handle the Addition and Subtraction from left to right:

To solve 5 + 3 # 2:

First, let's find the prime factors of |3| and |2|. The prime factor of 3 is 3, and the prime factor of 2 is 2. 

Thus, 3 # 2 = 0 because 3 and 2 do not share any common prime factors.

Therefore, our expression simplifies to 5 + 0.

The answer is 5."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:

                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)

                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

The first step is to deal with Parentheses:

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

The next steps in PEFMDASC are Exponents and Prime Factor Counting, but they do not appear in the problem, so we can skip it. The next operation is Multiplication and Division but they do not appear in the problem as well, so we move on to Addition and Subtraction:

= 6 @ 30 - 2 # 3

Next within ""PEFMDASC"" comes Prime Factor Counting:

= 6 @ 30 - 1
    [Since the prime factors of 2 are {2} and those of 3 are {3}; hence there are no shared prime factors and the count is 0.]

= 6 @ 29 
  [Since we calculate subtraction before concatenation, 30 - 1 results in 29.]

Finally, the last operation is the Concatenation:

= 629

Therefore, your answer is 629."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together.

                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
