1. Prime Factor Counting (F)
   - First, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation between 4 and 3.
     The prime factors of 4 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3.
     Since there are no shared prime factors, the result of 4 # 3 is 0.
   
2. Addition (A)
   - Next, we perform the addition operation between the result of 4 # 3 and 2.
     4 # 3 = 0, so the addition operation becomes 0 + 2, which equals 2.
