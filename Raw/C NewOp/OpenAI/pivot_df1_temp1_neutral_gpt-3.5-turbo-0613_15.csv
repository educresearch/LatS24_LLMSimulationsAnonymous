Step 1: Parentheses
Within the parentheses, we have 14 + 4 which equals 18. So the expression becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents (none in this expression)
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting
The prime factors of 18 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 3 are 3 itself. Since there is only one shared prime factor (which is 3), we have:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (left to right)
There are no multiplication or division operations in this expression.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
Now we have:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 1
