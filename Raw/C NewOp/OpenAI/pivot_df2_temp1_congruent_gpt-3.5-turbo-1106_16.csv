1. First, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation (#) because it comes before addition in the order of operations.

So, 3 # 2 = 1 (as the prime factor of 3 is 3 and the prime factor of 2 is 2. There is only one shared prime factor, which is 2.)

2. Then, we perform addition.

5 + 1 = 6

Now we perform addition:
5 + 1 = 6

Therefore, the answer is 6.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 3 # 2 using the PEFMDASC order, we first need to evaluate the prime factor counting #, as it comes before addition and subtraction.

Since the absolute value of 3 is 3 and the absolute value of 2 is 2, we can find the prime factorization of these numbers:
- Prime factors of 3: 3 (1 shared prime factor)
- Prime factors of 2: 2 (1 shared prime factor)

So, 3 # 2 = 1 (since there is only 1 shared prime factor).

gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: First, we need to follow the order of operations according to PEFMDASC:

Step 1: Parentheses
We evaluate the expression inside the parentheses first:

Step 2: Concatenation (C)
Next, we perform the concatenation operation:
6@(18) = 618

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Following the order of operations, we move on to prime factor counting operation:
12-2#3 = 10#3
The prime factors of 10 are 2 and 5, while the prime factor of 3 is 3. There is no shared prime factor, so 10#3 = 0.

Step 4: Addition and Subtraction
Next, we perform the addition and then subtraction:
618 + 12 - 0 = 630

Therefore, the final answer is 630.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the revised order of operations, which is PEFMDASC. Let's break down the expression step by step:

1. Parentheses: (14+4) equals 18
   So the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Prime Factor Counting: 18 and 3 have 1 shared prime factor, which is 3
   So the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 1

3. Concatenation: 6 @ 18 equals 618
   So the expression becomes: 618 + 12 - 2 # 1

4. Addition: 618 + 12 equals 630
   So the expression becomes: 630 - 2 # 1

5. Subtraction: 630 - 2 equals 628
   So the expression becomes: 628 # 1

6. Prime Factor Counting: 628 and 1 have no shared prime factors
   The final answer is: 0.

Therefore, the final answer is 0.","GPT Response: To solve the given expression according to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we will follow these steps:

1. First, we evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: (14+4) = 18.
2. Next, we evaluate the concatenation operation: 6@(14+4) = 618.
3. Then, we calculate the subtraction: 12-2 = 10.
4. After that, we perform the prime factor counting operation: 18 # 3 = 1.

Therefore, the final answer is ""The answer is 101.""","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help with that! Let's solve the expression step by step using the new operations and updated order of operations.

Given Expression: 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3

Step 1: Solve the parentheses.
6@(14+4) = 6@18
Since 6 and 18 are both positive, we can directly concatenate them.
6@18 = 618

The expression now becomes:
618 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Solve the concatenation.
The concatenation operation is last in the order of operations.

618 + 12 - 2 # 3
= 618 + 12 - 2 # 3
= 618 + 12 - 0 (since there is no shared prime factor between 2 and 3)
= 630 - 0
= 630

The answer is 630."
