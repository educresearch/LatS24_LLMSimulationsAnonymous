gpt-4-0613,1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: First let's evaluate the prime factor counting operation (4 # 3):

The prime factors of 4 are 2 (in 2²), while the prime factors of 3 are 3. Thus, they do not share any prime factors. Therefore, 4 # 3 = 0.

Substituting this in our equation, we get:
0 + 2 = 2.

So, finally,
The answer is 2.","GPT Response: First, we perform the Prime Factor Counting operation:

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and those of 3 are 3. So, the shared prime factors between 4 and 3 is none, so 4 # 3 = 0.

Then the equation becomes:
0 + 2

Finally, we perform addition:

0 + 2 is 2.

Therefore, 

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: According to the newly introduced mathematical operation Prime Factor Counting (F), we have to find the unique prime factors common to |4| and |3|. 

The prime factor of 4 is 2, and the prime factor of 3 is 3 itself. There are no common prime factors between 4 and 3. 

So, 4 # 3 = 0. 

The complete operation now becomes 0 + 2. 

Therefore, The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Let's solve this step-by-step:

Given expression: 4 # 3 + 2

According to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, prime factor counting (F) is evaluated before addition (A). 

(i) Evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F): 
4 # 3 = 0
Because the prime factor of 4 is 2, and the prime factor of 3 is 3, they have no shared prime factors. 

Also, notice that we proceed from left to right, meaning we've evaluated 4 # 3 before considering the ""+ 2"".

So, the expression becomes: 
0 + 2

(ii) Now deal with Addition (A), the remaining operation
0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: According to the new PEFMDASC order of operations, we need to evaluate addition before concatenation. 

Starting with 5 + 2, this results in 7.

Then, we concatenate 7 and 4 using the @ operation. This results in 74.

So, based on the new operation rules:

5 + 2 @ 4 = 7 @ 4 = 74

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, the addition operation comes before the concatenation operation. Hence, we solve for addition first before concatenation:

5 + 2 = 7 

Then, we proceed with the concatenation operation:

7 @ 4 equals 74.

So, the final answer to the problem 5 + 2 @ 4 is 74.

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: According to the newly introduced order of operations PEFMDASC, we first have to perform the operations in Parentheses (P), Exponents (E), Prime Factor Counting (F), Multiplication and Division (M/D; from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (A/S ; from left to right), and finally Concatenation (C).

In this case, the given expression is ""5 + 2 @ 4"". According to the rules specified above, addition comes before concatenation. So, first, we do the addition and then the concatenation.

Please follow along:

First step:
5 + 2 = 7

Second step:
7 @ 4 = 74

So, the answer to the problem ""5 + 2 @ 4"" is 74. Therefore,

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: Let's solve this step by step:

Given expression: 5 + 2 @ 4

According to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, addition comes after concatenation. 

So, we evaluate concatenation first: 2 @ 4 which simply joins the digits 2 and 4 together to make 24.

Now we substitute back into the expression: 5 + 24

Then, we do the addition, which is 5 + 24 = 29

The answer is 29."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: First let's evaluate the prime factor counting operation (since F comes before A in PEFMDASC):

3 # 2 = 1, as both 3 and 2 are primes and thus have no shared factors.

So, the expression becomes: 

5 + 1

Which evaluates to 6.

So, the answer is 6.","GPT Response: According to the new order of operations PEFMDASC, the Prime Factor Counting operation has to be done before the Addition operation. 

The prime factors of 3 are 3 itself and for 2 its 2 itself, as both are prime numbers. So there are no common prime factors present, hence the result of the F operation for 3 and 2 is 0.

Substitute 0 in place of 3 # 2, the expression becomes 5 + 0, which equals to 5.

Therefore, The answer is 5.","GPT Response: According to the newly introduced order of operations PEFMDASC, we first have to perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation before Addition (A). 

So let's do that:

(a) Prime Factor Counting (F): We have a = 3 and b = 2.
The prime factor of 3 is 3, and the prime factor of 2 is 2. 
These are both unique prime factors, so they don't share any common prime factors.

Therefore, 3 # 2 = 0.

Then we are left with the equation: 5 + 0

(a) Addition (A): Here, we simply add 5 + 0, which equals 5.

gpt-4-0613,1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parenthesis, i.e 14 + 4 = 18. So, the expression becomes:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Here, we need to remember that the order of operations is from left to right due to the newly updated order of operations. Our next operation therefore, is prime factor counting which comes before addition and comes before concatenation. So, we evaluate 2 # 3 = 1 (since they share only one prime factor, i.e., 2). So the expression becomes:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

Next, we proceed from left to right, remember we've to follow the order of operations PEFMDASC. The next operation is concatenation which comes before addition, this results in:

618 + 12 - 1

Continue with the order of operations PEFMDASC, we see that addition comes before subtraction. Thus, 618 + 12 = 630. The expression becomes:

630 - 1

And at last, subtraction which will result in:

629

Therefore, the final answer is 629. So,

The answer is 629.","GPT Response: According to the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we should first solve the operations inside the parentheses.

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 (Evaluating addition inside the parentheses)

Next, we have to perform the Prime Factor counting operation (F).

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (Since, prime factors of 2 are {2}, and prime factors of 3 are {3}. They do not share any common prime factors, so the result of F operation is 0.)

After Prime Factor counting, comes Multiplication and Division operations, but as they are not present in this case, we can proceed to Addition and Subtraction.

= 6 @ 18 + 11 (Performing subtraction operation)

Then finally, do the concatenation operation (C).

= 618 + 11 (Performing concatenation operation)

Lastly, perform the addition operation.

= 629 (Performing addition operation)

So, the answer for the given problem is 629.

The answer is 629.","GPT Response: First, we evaluate the expression inside the parentheses. According to both the old and new order of operations, parentheses are processed first. So, we have:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 

Then, we use the order of operations to do the prime factor counting operation (F) which comes after parentheses and exponents (we don't have any exponents to simplify in this problem).

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 
Also note, the prime factors of |2| are 2, and there are no prime factors of 3. That’s why 2 # 3 = 0.

Next in the order is multiplication or division, but we don't have any of those operations here. So, we move on to addition, which comes before the new concatenation operation.

= 6 @ 30 

Finally, we perform the concatenation:

= 630

So, solving the given mathematical expression using the updated order of operations results in 630. 

The answer is 630.","GPT Response: Here is the breakdown of the expression 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 according to the new order of operations PEFMDASC: 

Step 1: Handle Parentheses (P)
We start with evaluating the expression inside the parentheses:
14 + 4 = 18.
So, the new expression is 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Evaluate Exponents (E)
There are no exponents in the equation, so we can skip this step.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
The prime factor counting operation is performed between 2 and 3.
The Prime factors of 2 are {2}, and for 3 the factors are {3}.
There aren't any shared prime factors, so 2 # 3 = 0.
The updated equation is 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0.

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
There are no multiplication or division steps to perform in this equation.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Evaluate the addition and subtraction operations from left to right.
First, perform the addition operation: 18 + 12 = 30.
So, the new equation is 6 @ 30 - 0.
Then, perform the subtraction operation: 30 - 0 = 30.
So, the new equation is 6 @ 30.

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
Finally, perform the last operation, which is concatenation: 
6 @ 30 = 630.

gpt-4-0613,1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: First we have to find unique prime factors shared by |8| and |2|, and then |6| and |6|, because Prime Factor counting operation comes before addition according to new order of operations.

The unique prime factors of 8 (2^3) are just 2 and those for 2 (2^1) are also 2, so 8 # 2 = 1.

The unique prime factors for 6 (2*3) are 2 and 3, so 6 # 6 = 2, because 6 and 6 share both prime factors (2 and 3).

Then, 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 2, because we perform these operations before addition according to new order of operations.

So, we end up with 1 + 2 = 3.

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: In the given mathematical expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6, we need to follow the new order of operations PEFMDASC.

First, let's observe the prime factor counting operations in the expression:

a) 8 # 2: The prime factors of 8 are 2 (since 8 = 2*2*2), and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1, because there is one prime factor in common, viz., 2.

b) 6 # 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Hence, 6 # 6 = 2, as both 2 and 3 are present as prime factors in both numbers.

So, we replace the original expression with these calculated results:

We thus have 1 + 2.

Now, we just need to perform the addition operation:

1 + 2 = 3.

Therefore, the solution to 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 according to the new rules of operation is 3.

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: To understand how to solve this problem, we apply the new order of operations, PEFMDASC.

First, we solve for # operation, since it falls under Prime Factor Counting:

8 # 2 counts the number of common unique prime factors between 8 and 2.
Prime factors of 8 are 2, and prime factors of 2 are 2. They both share one common prime factor which is 2.
So, 8 # 2 = 1

Next, we solve 6 # 6.
Here, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since we are comparing the same number, it has the same prime factors. So, these will share two common prime factors (2 and 3).
So, 6 # 6 = 2
