gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we need to follow the expanded order of operations PEFMDASC.

The problem is:

5 + 2 @ 4

According to the new order of operations, we need to perform the concatenation after we've done the addition because addition (A) comes before concatenation (C) in the order PEMDAS to PEFMDASC.

So we first evaluate the addition:

5 + 2 = 7

Then we perform the concatenation with the result and 4:

7 @ 4 = 74

Thus, the final answer is ""The answer is 74."""
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 8 # 2 + 6 # 6, we must follow the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. (P) Parentheses
2. (E) Exponents
3. (F) Prime Factor counting
4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)

Since there are no parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, or concatenation operations explicitly given, we start with the prime factor counting operation, which is the highest priority operation present.

8 # 2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (2^3). The prime factors of 2 are just 2. They share one unique prime factor: 2. So, 8 # 2 = 1.

6 # 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since both numbers are the same, they share the same prime factors. However, since 6 is composed of two unique prime factors (2 and 3), and we are looking at the number of unique shared prime factors, the result will simply be the count of those unique prime factors. So, 6 # 6 = 2 (since both the shared prime factors 2 and 3 are counted).

Now we only have addition left:

1 + 2 =3

Thus, the final answer is 3 and in the specified format: 

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem with the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to follow these steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F)
2. Addition (A)

The problem given is:
4#3 + 2

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
We first need to find out the count of unique prime factors shared by |4| and |3|.

- The prime factors of 4 are 2 (as 4 = 2 * 2).
- The prime factors of 3 are 3 (as 3 is a prime number itself).
- The shared count of unique prime factors is 0 because they have no prime factors in common.

So, 4#3 = 0.

Step 2: Addition (A)
Now that we have the result of 4#3, we can add 2 to it.

0 + 2 = 2.

So the final answer is 2.

The problem is: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

1. (P) Parentheses
Firstly, solve the parentheses, (14+4), to get:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

2. (E) Exponents
There are no exponents in this problem, so we move on to the next operation.

3. (F) Prime Factor counting
Next, solve the prime factor counting operation, 2#3:
Since 2 has prime factors 2, and 3 has prime factors 3, there are no shared prime factors, 
2#3 = 0, so we get:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

4. (M) Multiplication
There is no multiplication to be done.

5. (D) Division
There is no division to be done.

6. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
Now we perform addition and subtraction from left to right:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 becomes
6 @ 18 + 12 (since subtracting 0 doesn't change the value)

The addition gives us:
6 @ 30

7. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
Finally, the concatenation operation:
6 @ 30 simply concatenates the digits of 6 and 30, resulting in:
630

Putting it all together, the final answer is: 630.

1. (P) Parentheses - There are no parentheses to evaluate.
2. (E) Exponents - There are no exponents to evaluate.
3. (F) Prime Factor Counting - We have to evaluate 3 # 2, which counts the number of unique prime factors shared by 3 and 2.

The prime factor of 3 is 3, and the prime factor of 2 is 2. So they share no common prime factors.

3 # 2 = 0

4. (M) Multiplication - There is no multiplication to evaluate.
5. (D) Division - There is no division to evaluate.
6. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction - Now, we perform the addition with the result from the prime factor counting.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F): This operation is not present in this example.
4. Multiplication/Division (M/D): There is no multiplication or division in this example.
5. Addition/Subtraction (A/S): There is addition present, but we cannot resolve it yet because the concatenation should come first according to the new order.
6. Concatenation (C): We must perform the concatenation operation before the addition.

Thus, we resolve the concatenation first:

Here are the steps:

1. Evaluate 8 # 2:
The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (2^3), and the prime factors of 2 are just 2. Both numbers share the prime factor 2.
So, 8 # 2 = 1 (since 2 is the shared prime factor).

2. Evaluate 6 # 6:
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since we are counting the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of both numbers, and since the numbers are equal, the shared prime factors are the prime factors of the number itself, which are 2 and 3.
So, 6 # 6 = 2 (since the shared prime factors are 2 and 3).

3. Now, add the results from steps 1 and 2:
1 (from 8 # 2) + 2 (from 6 # 6) = 3.

Thus, 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 2 = 3.

There are no exponents to evaluate in this problem.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
We need to perform the operation 4 # 3, which counts the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 4 and 3.

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (or just 2 if we are looking at unique factors).
The prime factor of 3 is 3.

Since there are no shared prime factors, the result of 4 # 3 is 0.

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
There is no multiplication or division to perform in this problem.

The given expression is: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

First, we solve what's inside the parentheses (P):

(14 + 4) = 18

The expression now is: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Next, we evaluate the prime factor counting (F):

2#3 is the count of unique prime factors shared by 2 and 3. The prime factors of 2 are {2}, and the prime factors of 3 are {3}. They share no prime factors, so:

2#3 = 0

The expression now is: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Now, we handle multiplication and division (M/D), but since there are none in the expression, we skip this step.

Following that, we handle addition and subtraction (A/S):

12 - 0 = 12

The expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12

Finally, we perform the concatenation (C):

6 @ 18 = 618

Now adding 12:

8 # 2: Both 8 and 2 have the prime factor 2 in common.

6 # 6: The prime factorization of 6 is 2 * 3. There is one unique prime factor of 2 and one unique prime factor of 3, both in common with itself, so 6 # 6 = 2, as we count 2 and 3.
