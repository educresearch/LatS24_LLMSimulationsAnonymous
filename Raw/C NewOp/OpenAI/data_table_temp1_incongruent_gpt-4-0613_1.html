      <td>6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First we proceed by applying the priority order of the operations. <br><br>The newly defined priority order is PEFMDASC. Thus, we have parentheses first. Inside the parentheses, however, we have an addition operation "14+4". Solving that, we have:<br><br>6 @ (18) + 12 - 2#3<br><br>Next, there are no more expressions within parentheses nor exponents to solve, so we can move to the Prime Factor Counting operation. For that, we have to find answer of "2#3". Since the only prime factor of 2 is 2 and of 3 is 3 and there are no shared prime factors, "2#3" equals 0. <br><br>Replacing that in the equation, the expression becomes:<br><br>6 @ 18 + 12 - 0<br><br>Next, based on the order of operations, we have to perform multiplication or division (if any), but there's none in the equation.   <br>So we move further to the next operation which is addition or subtraction.
