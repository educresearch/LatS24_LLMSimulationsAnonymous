gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: According to the newly defined order of operations PEFMDASC, we first have to perform any operations inside parentheses, then evaluate any exponents, then perform prime factor counting, followed by multiplication and division from left to right, then addition and subtraction from left to right, and finally, we perform concatenation from left to right.

For the expression 5 + 2 @ 4, we do not have any parentheses, exponents, prime factor counting, multiplication, or division to perform. So, we start with addition and then do the concatenation.

Here is the step-by-step evaluation:

1. Perform the addition (A) before the concatenation (C):
   5 + 2 = 7

2. Then perform the concatenation (@), taking into account that addition takes precedence over concatenation:
   7 @ 4 = 74

Therefore, the final answer is 74. 

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: Let's evaluate the given mathematics problem step by step using the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F)
   - Evaluate 8 # 2:
     Prime factors of 8 are 2, and prime factors of 2 are 2.
     Since both have the prime factor 2 in common, there is 1 shared prime factor.
     So, 8 # 2 = 1

   - Evaluate 6 # 6:
     Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
     Since both numbers have the same prime factors, 2 and 3, there are 2 shared prime factors.
     So, 6 # 6 = 2

2. Addition (A)
   - Add the results of the prime factor counting:
     1 + 2 = 3

So after evaluating the problem according to the updated rules, we get the final answer:

Let's solve the given expression:

4 # 3 + 2

First, let's find the result of the Prime Factor Counting operation between 4 and 3:

4 has prime factors: 2 (2 * 2)
3 has prime factors: 3

There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so:

4 # 3 = 0

Now the expression simplifies to:

0 + 2

Now we perform the addition:

0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2."

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

First, we handle the operation inside the parentheses (P):

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F) since it comes before addition and subtraction in the order:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0
(Note: prime factors of 2 are 2, and prime factors of 3 are 3. There are no common prime factors, thus 2 # 3 = 0.)

Now we perform the addition and subtraction operations (A and S):

6 @ (18 + 12)
6 @ 30

Finally, we carry out the concatenation operation (C):

6 @ 30 = 630

Therefore, based on the problem and the newly updated order of operations, the final answer is:

The answer is 630."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: According to the newly defined operations and updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation before addition.

So we have the expression:

5 + 3#2

Here, ""3#2"" is the prime factor counting operation (#). To solve ""3#2"", we identify the unique prime factors of 3 and 2.

3 has the prime factors of: 3
2 has the prime factors of: 2

Since there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, we have:

3#2 = 0

Now, with this result, we can continue solving the original expression:

5 + 3#2
= 5 + 0  (since 3#2 equals 0)
= 5      (since 5 plus 0 is still 5)

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC (Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction, Concatenation).

Here is the given expression:

8#2 + 6#6

Let's evaluate this step-by-step:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):

For the term 8#2:
The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (since 8 = 2^3).
The prime factors of 2 are just 2 (since 2 is prime).
The shared prime factors of 8 and 2 are the prime factor(s) 2.
Therefore, 8#2 equals the count of unique shared prime factors, which is 1 (since 2 is the only shared prime factor, and it is counted once).

For the term 6#6:
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 (since 6 = 2 * 3).
The shared prime factors of 6 and itself are the prime factors 2 and 3.
Therefore, 6#6 equals the count of unique shared prime factors, which is 2 (since 2 and 3 are the shared prime factors and each is counted once).

2. Addition:

Now that we have the results of the prime factor counting:
8#2 = 1
6#6 = 2

We can add them together:
1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: The given expression is 4 # 3 + 2.

First, we evaluate the prime factor counting (#) operation, according to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC.

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (or 2 squared), and the prime factors of 3 are just 3. Since there are no common prime factors between 4 and 3, the prime factor counting of these two numbers is 0.

So, 4 # 3 = 0.

Now we add 2 to the result:

0 + 2 = 2.

Thus, the final result of the expression is 2.

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: Let's follow the steps carefully using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Parentheses (P): Evaluate expressions within parentheses first.
2. Exponents (E): No exponents in this expression.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): Prime Factor Counting comes after we handle the parentheses.
4. Multiplication/Division (M/D): Similarly, these come after parentheses and Prime Factor Counting.
5. Addition/Subtraction (A/S): These come after parentheses, Prime Factor Counting, Multiplication, and Division.
6. Concatenation (C): Concatenation comes last.

Now, let's solve the given problem step by step:

6@(14+4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Resolve the expression in parentheses (P):
6@(18) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F) - Since we have 2 # 3, we need to find the shared unique prime factors of 2 and 3. We have:
Prime factors of 2: 2
Prime factors of 3: 3
Since there are no shared prime factors, 2 # 3 equals 0:
6@18 + 12 - 0

Step 3: Perform the Concatenation (C):
Since 6@(18) needs to be evaluated, we concatenate the digits of 6 and 18 to get 618:
618 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Now we can do the Addition/Subtraction (A/S):
618 + 12 = 630
630 - 0 = 630

Thus, the final answer to the problem is 630:
The answer is 630."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: The given expression is 5 + 3 # 2.

First, we need to evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) before proceeding with Addition (A) due to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC.

Let's figure out the prime factors:  
- The prime factors of 3 are 3 itself as it is a prime number.  
- The prime factors of 2 are 2 itself as it is a prime number.  

Since both 3 and 2 have no common prime factors, the result of 3 # 2 is 0.

Now, we simply add 5 to the result of the prime factor counting operation.

The expression becomes:  
5 + (3 # 2)

Let's calculate:

5 + 2 @ 4

Since ""A"" comes before ""C"" in the order (Addition before Concatenation), we should add first:

5 + 2 = 7

Now we use Concatenation:

7 @ 4 = 74 (Merging the digits of 7 and 4)

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem, we use both the new operation of Prime Factor Counting (F) and the updated order of operations, PEFMDASC:

Given problem: 8#2 + 6#6

First, we identify the prime factors involved to use the Prime Factor Counting operation.

The prime factors of 8 are: 2, 2, and 2 (or \(2^3\))
The prime factors of 2 are: 2
The prime factors of 6 are: 2 and 3

Now, we apply the Prime Factor Counting operation:

8#2 finds the unique prime factors that are common to both. Thatâ€™s just 2. Since there's only one prime factor in common, the result is 1.

6#6 finds the unique prime factors that are common to both operands. Since 6 has the prime factors 2 and 3, the common prime factors in 6 and 6 would be both 2 and 3. However, we only count unique prime factors once, the result is 2.

Now we perform the addition. The updated order of operations indicates doing the Prime Factor Counting (F) before Addition (A).

8#2 + 6#6
= 1 + 2
= 3

Using the updated order of operations, we complete the Prime Factor Counting operations first and then the addition. The final answer is:

Here's the breakdown:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F)
2. Addition (A)

Starting with the expression:

4 # 3 + 2

Firstly, let's determine the prime factors of 4 and 3:

- The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (or 2^2).
- The prime factor of 3 is 3 itself.

Since there are no common prime factors between 4 and 3, the Prime Factor Counting operation gives us 0:

4 # 3 = 0 

Now we can proceed to the addition:

0 + 2 = 2

So the final answer to the expression 4 # 3 + 2 is:

6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3

First, we resolve the expression within the parentheses (P):
6@(18) + 12 - 2 # 3

Next is to address any exponents (E), but there are none in this expression. After that, we do the Prime Factor Counting (F): 2#3. The prime factor of 2 is 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3, so they share no common prime factors.
6@(18) + 12 - 0

Now, we take care of Multiplication (M) and Division (D), but there are none to address. 

We then move on to Addition (A) and Subtraction (S). In this case, we must add 12 and subtract 0 from the result of the concatenation:
6@(18) + 12

Now the Concatenation (C) is performed:
6@18 = 618

We now have:
618 + 12

Finally, we perform the pending addition:
618 + 12 = 630

Putting it all together with the addition and subtraction resolved:

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: To solve 5 + 3#2 according to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we must consider Prime Factor Counting (F) before Addition (A).

First, let's determine the result of the Prime Factor Counting operation between 3 and 2:

3#2: The prime factors of 3 are {3} and the prime factors of 2 are {2}. Since there are no common prime factors, the result is 0.

4. Multiplication (M) / Division (D): There is no multiplication or division to evaluate.
5. Addition (A) / Subtraction (S): Normally we would perform addition here, but according to the new order of operations, Concatenation (C) comes last, after addition and subtraction.
6. Concatenation (C): We need to concatenate 2 and 4. Concatenation joins the digits together.
   - Perform 2 @ 4: Concatenating 2 and 4 will result in 24.

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: Let's solve the given expression step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
    - First, we evaluate 8 # 2:
        The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or \(2^3\)).
        The prime factor of 2 is 2.
        They share the prime factor of 2. Since the count of unique shared prime factors between 8 and 2 is 1, we have 8 # 2 = 1.

    - Next, we evaluate 6 # 6:
        The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
        Since we are looking for the count of unique shared prime factors between the same number (6 in this case), it's clear that it will share all of its prime factors with itself.
        So, 6 # 6 will count the unique prime factors of 6. There are 2 unique prime factors (2 and 3).
        Therefore, 6 # 6 = 2.

2. Addition (A):
    - Now with the results from the prime factor counting, we add them together:

The first calculation we need to do is Prime Factor Counting between 4 and 3 (denoted by 4 # 3). Since we are considering the prime factors of 4 (which are 2 & 2) and the prime factors of 3 (which is 3), there are no shared prime factors. Therefore, 4 # 3 results in 0.

Step 2: Addition (A)

Now we proceed with addition. We add the result of the Prime Factor Counting from the previous step to 2:

Step 1: Handle the Parentheses first
\[ 6@(14+4) + 12 - 2 # 3 \]
\[ 6@(18) + 12 - 2 # 3 \] (since 14+4=18)

Step 2: There are no Exponents to deal with, so we move to the next step.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting
\[ 6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3 \]
\[ 6@18 + 12 - 1 \] (since the prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3, there are no shared prime factors, so we get 0. However, there's an error in the prompt's information about shared prime factors of 2 and 3: they are different, but the general example a # b = 0 when there's no common prime factor still stands.)

Step 4: There's no Multiplication or Division, so we move to the next step.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Before we add or subtract, we need to address the Concatenation operation since according to the order provided, Concatenation needs to be executed after Addition/Subtraction but before the Concatenation yet to be done.
