gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Based on the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, the problem 5 + 2 @ 4 should be solved as follows:

Firstly, it doesn't have parentheses (P), exponents (E), or prime factor counting (F).
Secondly, there is no multiplication (M) or division (D).
Thirdly, addition (A) should be done before concatenation (C). Thus, we first perform 5 + 2, which equals 7.
Then, with the result of 7, we perform concatenation with 4, i.e., 7 @ 4, which is equivalent to adding digits of 4 after 7, giving us 74.

Therefore, the solution to the problem 5 + 2 @ 4 is 74.

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: Remember the order of operations is PEFMDASC.
First we would analyze the values of the Prime Factor Counting operation ""#"", which comes second in PEFMDASC.
8 # 2 results in 1, because both numbers have a prime factor of 2.
6 # 6 results in 1, because both numbers have a prime factor of 2 and 3, but since the numbers are the same, only the unique prime factors are considered.

So: 

8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 1

We then perform the addition operation, which is next in the order PEFMDASC.

The final answer of the equation will be 2:

Therefore, the answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: The first step is to evaluate the operation with higher priority according to PEFMDASC. Here, it is Prime Factor Counting (#).
4 and 3 do not have any common prime factors - prime factor of 4 is 2 and prime factor of 3 is 3.
So, 4 # 3 = 0.
Then, we will perform the operation with next higher priority 'Addition'.
So, 0 + 2 = 2.

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: First, follow the order of operation PEFMDASC:

Step 1: Handle Parentheses (P)
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3. 

Step 2: Deal with Exponents (E)
There are no exponents in the equation

Step 3: Handle Prime Factor Counting (F)
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1. 
(Prime factors of 2 are 2 and prime factors of 3 are 3, hence shared factors are 0.)

Step 4: Handle Multiplication and Division (M, D)
There are no multiplication or division operations in the equation.

Step 5: Handle Addition and Subtraction (A, S)
= 6 @ 30 - 1
= 6 @ 29.

Step 6: Handle Concatenation (C)
= 629.

The answer is 629."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: We first perform the Prime Factor Counting operation because in PEFMDASC, F comes before A. 

Prime factors of 3 are {3} and prime factors of 2 are {2}. The intersection of these two sets is an empty set, therefore count of unique shared prime factors is 0.

So, 3 # 2 = 0.

Substitute 0 into the original equation, and we get

5 + 0 = 5.

So, the answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: According to the revised order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to perform addition before the Concatenation operation. Therefore, in the given example, the addition operation will be executed first.

So, the equation becomes:

= 5 + 2 @ 4
= 7 @ 4 (since addition comes first)
= 74 (apply the Concatenation operation)

Therefore, the solution to the problem is 74. 

So, the final answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: First, we perform the prime factor counting operation as it has the 3rd highest precedence (PEFMDASC).

8 # 2 = 1 because 2 is the only prime factor of 8 that is shared with 2.
6 # 6 = 1 because when two same numbers are compared, they share the same prime factors.

So, the provided expression becomes:
1 + 1

Since addition operation comes before concatenation in PEFMDASC, we perform addition:

1 + 1 = 2

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: Given the problem: 4 # 3 + 2

Let's apply the new order of operations (PEFMDASC).

First, we'll calculate the prime factor count (operation F) which is the first operation that appears in the expression 4 # 3 + 2. The prime factors of |4| are just 2, while the prime factors of |3| are just 3. There are no shared prime factors between |4| and |3|. 

So, 4 # 3 equals 0. 

The expression becomes: 0 + 2

Then, we apply the operation of addition (A). 

0 + 2 equals 2.

So, the answer to the given problem is 2.

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: Following PEFMDASC order of operations:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 (solve parentheses first)
= 618 + 12 - 2 # 3 (concatenation comes later after parentheses are solved)
= 618 + 12 - 1 (prime factor counting comes before addition and subtraction. Prime factors of 2 are 2 and prime factors of 3 are 3, so there are no shared prime factors, thus the operation results in 0.)
= 630 - 1 (addition comes before subtraction)
= 629 (subtraction) 

The answer is 629."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: Given the problem: 5 + 3 # 2

Let's apply the new order of operations (PEFMDASC).

First, we'll calculate the prime factor count (operation F) which is the number of unique prime factors shared between 3 and 2.

Prime factors of |3|: {3}
Prime factors of |2|: {2}
With these, the shared prime factors are 0 as 3 and 2 don't have a shared factor. 

So, 3 # 2 = 0.

The original problem simplifies to: 5 + 0

Then we add, using the normal order of operation for addition (operation A).

So, 5 + 0 = 5

Therefore, the solution to the problem is 5. 

The answer is 5."

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: Let's proceed with the calculations using the new PEFMDASC order of operations:

First, we will be carrying out the F operation, which is Prime Factor counting. 

For the first # operation, we have 8 and 2. The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 2 is 2. Then, the count of unique prime factors common to 8 and 2 is 1, so 8 # 2 = 1.

For the second # operation, we have 6 and 6. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. The number of unique prime factors common to 6 and 6 is 2 (since 6 and 6 have the same prime factors), so 6 # 6 = 2.

We replace the # operations in the expression with these results:
1 + 2 

Finally, we perform the + operation:
1 + 2 = 3

So, the final answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: In the problem 4 # 3 + 2, 

We will first evaluate the prime factor counting operation (F) according to the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC).

Prime factors of 4 are {2}. 
Prime factors of 3 are {3}.
As there are no common prime factors, 4 # 3 = 0.

The equation becomes 0 + 2.

Then, we will evaluate the addition operation.

Therefore, 0 + 2 = 2.

So the final answer to the given mathematics problem ""4 # 3 + 2"" is 2.

The answer is 2."

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we perform the Prime Factor Counting operation:

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

Now, we perform the addition operation:

= 6 @ 18 + 11

Finally, we perform the concatenation operation to get our final answer:

= 618 + 11
= 629

Therefore, the answer is 629."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: In the problem 5 + 3 # 2, 

We will first evaluate the prime factor counting operation as it has higher precedence (F is evaluated before A):

Prime factors of 3 are {3}, and prime factors of 2 are {2}. There is no shared prime factor, so 3 # 2 = 0.

So, the problem becomes

5 + 0 = 5.

So, the final answer is 5.

Therefore, ""The answer is 5."""
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, firstly, we need to perform addition before concatenation. So:

Step 1:
Perform the operation of 5 + 2.
5 + 2 = 7.

Step 2:
Now, perform the concatenation operation with the previous result and 4.
7 @ 4. 

Since ""Concatenation"" (C) joins the digits of the two numbers being concatenated, we get:
7 @ 4 = 74.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: Alright, let's solve this expression step-by-step using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC).

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
   8 # 2 and 6 # 6. 
   The prime factors of |8| are 2, and the prime factors of |2| are also 2. So they share 1 prime factor, and therefore, 8 # 2 equals 1.
   The prime factors of |6| are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of |6| are also 2 and 3. So they share 2 prime factors, and therefore, 6 # 6 equals 2.

So we can rewrite the expression as: 1 + 2.

2. Addition (A): 
   Calculate 1 + 2, which equals to 3.

Therefore, the final result of the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 is 3.

The answer is 3."

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: Let's solve the given mathematical expression step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations.

The given expression is: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
Start by solving the operation within parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18
So, the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, calculate the prime factor counting: 2 # 3
The prime factors of 2 are 2, and of 3 are 3. They have no shared prime factors. So, 2 # 3 = 0.
Replace the prime factor counting with this value. The expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Now, calculate the result of addition and subtraction from left to right.
First, do the addition operation: 6 @ 18 + 12 = 6 @ 30
Then, do the subtraction operation: 6 @ 30 - 0 = 6 @ 30

Step 4: Concatenation (C)
Lastly, perform the concatenation operation: 6 @ 30 = 630

Hence, the answer to the given mathematical expression is 630."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: Using our updated order of operations PEFMDASC, firstly, we need to calculate the prime factor counting (F) operation since it comes before the addition (A) operation in our updated order.

The prime factor counting operation, represented by ""#"", calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. Here a=3 and b=2.

The prime factor of 3 is 3, and the prime factor of 2 is 2. As such, there are no shared factors between 3 and 2.

So, 3 # 2 = 0

Now our new equation looks like this: 
5 + 0

Finally, we proceed with the addition:
= 5

The answer is 5."
