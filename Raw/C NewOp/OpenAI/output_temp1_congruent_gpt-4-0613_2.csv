For 6#6, both numbers are the same and will share the same factors. The factors of 6 are 2 and 3. So, they share two unique prime factors, which are 2 and 3. 
Hence, 6#6 is 2.

So our equation changes from 
6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3
to 
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3.

Next, according to the order of operations, we perform the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation, i.e., 2 # 3. Since the prime factor of 2 is 2 and prime factor of 3 is 3, there is no shared prime factor. Hence 2 # 3 = 0.  The equation now changes to:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0.

Next, in accordance with the order of operations, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right:
= 6 @ 18 + 12
= 6 @ 30

Therefore, the final answer to our given problem is 630.

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

Therefore, 8#2 = 1 since they share one prime factor, which is 2.

(ii) Calculate 6#6 
    The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. 
Since 6#6 are identical, they share all their prime factors, which are 2 and 3. Therefore, 6#6 = 2.

1. Evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F). Here 8#2 means the common unique prime factors 8 and 2 share. 8 is 2's multiple (2,4,8) and 2 itself is a prime number. Therefore, there is 1 common unique prime factor (2).
   Similarly, 6#6 means the common unique prime factors 6 and 6 share. For number 6, there are prime factors 2 and 3, therefore it has 2 unique prime factors.
   
   8#2 + 6#6 = 1 + 2.

2. Perform Addition (A).

systemPrompt3_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Given the mathematical operation:

5 + 3#2

First, you need to perform the prime factorization operation as F comes before A in the PEFMDASC sequence.
The prime factors of 3 are 3 itself, since 3 is a prime number. The prime factors of 2 are also 2, since 2 is the smallest prime number. Since there is no shared prime factor between 3 and 2, the operation 3#2 equates to 0.

So, the operation simplifies to:

5 + 0

Which then equates to 5 because the addition of 0 does not change a number.
So, 5 + 3#2 = 5

The answer is 5."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

  6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Since parentheses are first, evaluate the term within the parentheses:

  = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we handle the prime factor counting operation:

  The unique prime factors of 2 is {2} and the unique prime factors of 3 is {3}. Since these are different,  2 # 3 = 0.

  = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Now we can perform the additions:

  = 6 @ 18 + 12

  = 6 @ 30

Finally, we perform the concatenation operation:

  = 630

Therefore, the calculated value of the expression is 630.

The answer is 630."

First, we need to apply the operation of Prime Factor counting (#).

Prime factors of 3: 3
Prime factors of 2: 2

Now, we'll compare the prime factors of 3 and 2. Since there are no common prime factors, 3#2 = 0.

So, the expression 5 + 3#2 equals 5 + 0. 

Next, perform the addition operation. Thus, 5 + 0 equals 5.
