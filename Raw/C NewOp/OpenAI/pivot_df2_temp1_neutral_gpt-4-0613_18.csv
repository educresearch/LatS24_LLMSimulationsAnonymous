gpt-4-0613,1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, since we have a (F) Prime Factor Counting operation and an (A) Addition operation, and according to the PEFMDASC, we perform Prime Factor Counting operation first, then the Addition.

The unique prime factors of 4 are 2, and the unique prime factors of 3 are 3. So, they don't have any shared prime factors. Hence, 4 # 3 = 0.

Replacing the Prime Factor Counting operation's result into the initial given operation,
we now have: 0 + 2

Next, we execute the (A) Addition operation to get the final result.

So, 0 + 2 = 2

Therefore, the final answer is 2. Hence, 
""The answer is 2.""","GPT Response: Given the problem, 4 # 3 + 2, let's evaluate based on the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

First, let's evaluate Prime Factor Counting operation:

The prime factors of 4 are 2, while those of 3 are only 3, hence the operation 4 # 3 yields 0 since 2 and 3 have no shared prime factor.

So, the simplified expression becomes 0 + 2.

Finally, addition operation:

0 + 2 = 2

Therefore, the answer to the problem 4 # 3 + 2 is 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: First, we need to apply the Prime Factor Counting operation. The prime factor of 4 is 2, while the prime factor of 3 is only 3, so there are no shared prime factors. This gives us:

4 # 3 + 2 = 0 + 2

Addition comes next:

0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: In the problem, we are given the expression ""4 # 3 + 2"". Let's solve this step by step using the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Count the number of unique prime factors that 4 and 3 shares. The prime factor of 4 is 2 and the prime factor of 3 is 3. So, they don't have any unique factors in common. Hence, 4 # 3 = 0
   So, our equation becomes 0 + 2.

2. Addition (A): Since we have no more operations left except addition, we proceed with it. 0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Using the PEFMDASC (Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division (Left to Right), Addition and Subtraction (Left to Right) and Concatenation (Left to Right)) order, we shall evaluate the given expression:
5 + 2 @ 4

Since there are no Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication or Division operations, we move to Addition.

Evaluate the Addition operation: 
= 5 + 2 @ 4 

And then, we move to the Concatenation operation:

= 7 @ 4
= 74

So, based on the given order of operations, the answer is 74.","GPT Response: According to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), addition (A) comes before concatenation (C). Thus, we first need to perform the addition operation. After adding 5 and 2, we get 7. Then we perform the concatenation operation, concatenating the obtained sum (7) with 4.

So, the given expression, 5 + 2 @ 4 would be evaluated as below:

= (5 + 2) @ 4
= 7 @ 4
= 74

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: Firstly, we need to go by the order of operations. The operation of concatenation (C) needs to be executed after addition. Hence, 

1) We do the addition operation first: 5 + 2 = 7
2) Then we perform the concatenation operation: 7 @ 4 = 74

So, the final answer to the expression 5 + 2 @ 4 is 74.

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: According to the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we should perform addition before concatenation. Let's break down the steps.

Step 1:

gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: First, since we have a (F) Prime Factor Counting operation and an (A) Addition operation, and according to the PEFMDASC, we perform Prime Factor Counting operation before Addition operation.

Let's solve the Prime Factor Counting operation:
3 # 2

Prime factor of 3 is 3
Prime factor of 2 is 2
There is no shared prime factor between 3 and 2, therefore 3 # 2 = 0.

Replace the Prime Factor Counting operation in the initial problem by the result:
5 + 0

Finally, perform the addition: 5 + 0 = 5.

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: Given the problem, 5 + 3 # 2, let's evaluate based on the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

First, let's evaluate Prime Factor Counting operation (F):
3 # 2 = 1, 
(since the prime factors of 3 are {3} and the prime factors of 2 are {2}, and since there are no shared prime factors, the result is 0)

So, the problem becomes:
5 + 1

Now perform Addition (A):
5 + 1 = 6

Therefore the final answer is 6.

So the solution is ""The answer is 6.""","GPT Response: First, we need to follow the PEFMDASC rule. The operation Prime Factor Counting (notated as #) comes before addition. 

So, the prime factor of 3 is 3, and prime factor of 2 is 2. Since there are no shared prime factors, 3 # 2 = 0.

So, substituting this, we get the calculation to be 5 + 0.

This results in a final answer of 5. 

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: In the expression 5 + 3 # 2, we want to use the order of operations PEFMDASC. However, in this case, we do not have parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, or concatenation - we only have prime factor counting and addition. 

Let's first count the prime factors shared by 3 and 2. Prime factors of 3 are {3} and prime factors of 2 are {2}. There are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2. So 3 # 2 = 0.

So the new expression now is 5 + 0.

The operation in our expression now is addition, which is evaluated as usual:

5 + 0 = 5. 

So the answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: First, let's solve the operation inside the parentheses.

14 + 4 = 18

Now, we substitute it to the original operation:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Then, we conduct the Prime Factor Counting operation:

The prime factors of 2 are 2, and prime factors of 3 are 3. They do not share any prime factor. So their # operation will equals 0.

Therefore, the operation is simplified to:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Then, according to the PEFMDASC rule, we need to perform the addition operation before concatenation:

18 + 12 = 30

Substitute it back to the operation, the operation is simplified to:

6 @ 30

Finally, perform the Concatenation operation:

6 @ 30 = 630

So, the answer to this Mathematics problem is:

The answer is 630.","GPT Response: According to the order of operations PEFMDASC, we begin with parenthesis:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 

Nextly, we execute Prime Factor counting 'F':

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 

Next, we add 'A' and then subtract 'S':

6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 = 6 @ 30 - 1= 30 @ 29

Lastly, the Concatenation 'C' operation is used:

30 @ 29 = 3029

The answer is 3029.","GPT Response: The steps to solve this problem are as follows:

Step 1: First, we follow the parenthesis step in the order of operations PEFMDASC.
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 

Step 2: Next, we proceed to the prime factor step in the order of operations.
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 
(since the prime factors of 2 is 2 and the prime factors of 3 is 3, they share no prime factors, hence we count 0.)

Step 3: Then, according to order of operations (PEFMDASC), we move to the addition and subtraction from left to right.

= 630 - 1
= 629 

The answer is 629.","GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step-by-step following the PEFMDASC order of operations:

Step 1: Parentheses - The expression inside the parentheses needs to be evaluated first.

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting - The # operation is done before addition and subtraction

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 
(since prime factors of 2 are [2], and prime factors of 3 are [3], they share no prime factors, so the result of 2 # 3 is 0)

Step 3: Addition/Subtraction - Perform addition and subtraction from left to right

6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 
= 6 @ 18 + 11
= 6 @ 29 

Step 4: Concatenation - The last operation is concatenation, which joins the two numbers together as one number.

6 @ 29 
= 629

Hence:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 = 629

So, the answer is 629."
gpt-4-0613,1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: First, using (F) Prime Factor Counting operation, we compute:

8 # 2 = 1 because the prime factors of 8 are 2 and the prime factors of 2 are 2, so we have one shared prime factor which is 2.

and,

6 # 6 = 1 because the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, when we compare with the same number 6, we have both factors 2 and 3 as shared, but we only count unique ones, so the result is 1.

Then we do the addition operation:

1 + 1 = 2.

So the final answer is 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: In order to solve the provided problem using the newly introduced PEFMDASC order of operations, we need to proceed as follows:

Problem: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Step 1 (Prime Factor Counting (F)): Calculate 8 # 2 and 6 # 6.
Prime factors of 8 are {2}, and of 2 are {2}. They have 1 common factor, which is 2. Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1.
Prime factors of 6 are {2, 3} and of 6 are {2,3}. They have 2 common factors, which are 2 and 3. Therefore, 6 # 6 = 2.

So, the equation now stands as: 1 + 2.

Step 2 (Addition): Compute 1 + 2, which equals 3.

Therefore, the answer to the problem 8 # 2 + 6 # 6, using the updated order of operations, is simply 3.

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we apply the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC).

(i) First, we apply the operation Prime Factor Counting, as it comes before Addition in the order of operations.

Prime factor of 8 is 2. And, 2 is itself a prime number. The prime factors they share is just one, which is 2. So, 8 # 2 equals 1.

Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Again, the prime factors they share is just one, i.e., 2. So, 6 # 6 equals 1 too.

The problem now becomes: 1 + 1

(ii) Then, we apply the Addition operation

1 + 1 equals 2.

Therefore, the answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations, PEFMDASC. Here, we have two Prime Factor Counting (F - denoted by #) operations and an Addition (A).

The prime factors of 8 are 2, and the prime factors of 2 are also 2. Therefore, 8 # 2 evaluates to 1 since they share one prime factor - 2. 

We then need to calculate 6 # 6. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and since we're comparing 6 with 6 itself, they share the same prime factors. Therefore, 6 # 6 evaluates to 2 (i.e., there are 2 shared prime factors - 2 and 3).

So, the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 can be simplified to 1 + 2.

Doing the addition then, we get:

1 + 2 = 3

Hence, the entire expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 evaluates to 3, according to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC.

The answer is 3."
