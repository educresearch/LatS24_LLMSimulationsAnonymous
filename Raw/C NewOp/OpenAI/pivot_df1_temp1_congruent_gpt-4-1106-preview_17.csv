gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem \(5 + 2 @ 4\) using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we need to follow these steps:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
4. Multiplication (M) and Division (D) (left to right)
5. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S) (left to right)
6. Concatenation (C) (left to right)

Since there are no parentheses, exponents, prime factor counting, multiplication, or division involved in the given expression, we will start with addition and then proceed to concatenation.

The expression \(5 + 2 @ 4\) involves addition and concatenation. According to PEFMDASC, we must perform the addition before the concatenation. 

Therefore, we first add 5 and 2:

\(5 + 2 = 7\)

Now we concatenate the result with 4:

\(7 @ 4\)

Since concatenation is just joining the digits, we get

\(74\)

So the final answer is:

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: First, we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operations (#) since they come before addition in the new order of operations (PEFMDASC).

8#2: The absolute values are considered for the prime factor counting. The number 8's prime factors are 2, 2, and 2 (2^3), and the number 2's prime factor is 2. Since they share the prime factor 2, the count of unique shared prime factors is 1.

6#6: The number 6's prime factors are 2 and 3. Since we are comparing the number with itself, it shares all of its prime factors. However, we are only counting unique prime factors, so despite the number 6 having two prime factors, the count of unique shared prime factors is 2 (2 and 3).

Now we have:
8#2 + 6#6 = 1 + 2

After evaluating the prime factor counts, we proceed with the addition:
1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3."

Given the expression: 4 # 3 + 2 

Step 1: Evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F)
- The primary factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (since 4 = 2^2).
- The primary factors of 3 are just 3.
- There are no common prime factors between 4 and 3.

So, 4 # 3 = 0

Step 2: Evaluate Addition (A)
- Now, we have 0 + 2 from the previous step.

0 + 2 = 2

Thus, the final answer is 2.

1. (P) Parentheses: Evaluate the expression within the parentheses first.
   14 + 4 = 18

So, the expression becomes:
6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. (E) Exponents: There are no exponents to evaluate.

3. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation (#): Evaluate the prime factor counting next.
   We need to find the count of unique prime factors shared by |2| and |3|.
   The prime factors of 2 are just 2 (since it's a prime number itself).
   The prime factors of 3 are just 3 (since it's also a prime number).
   There are no shared prime factors, so 2 # 3 = 0.

The expression now becomes:
6@18 + 12 - 0

4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division: There are no multiplication or division operations to perform.

5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction: Evaluate addition and subtraction from left to right.
   12 - 0 = 12

The expression now is:
6@18 + 12

6. (C) Concatenation (L to R): Concatenate 6 and 18 first because concatenation comes before addition in the order of operations.
   6 @ 18 = 618 (concatenation of 6 and 18).

Now add 12 to the concatenated number:
   618 + 12 = 630

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the problem, we need to follow the revised order of operations: PEFMDASC.

Given the problem 5 + 2 @ 4, let's apply the order of operations:

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses to evaluate.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents to evaluate.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): There are no prime factor counting operations to evaluate.
4. Multiplication/Division (M/D): There are no multiplication or division operations to evaluate.
5. Addition/Subtraction (A/S): Addition comes next, but in this case, we must be cautious since the concatenation operation has a lower precedence.
6. Concatenation (C): This operation is present and will be the last operation we perform.

So, we proceed with the concatenation first, because addition must wait until after concatenation in this specific case:

2 @ 4 = 24 (since concatenation is simply combining the digits of the numbers together)

Now that we have the result of the concatenation, we can add it to 5:

5 + 24 = 29

Therefore, the final answer to the problem is 29.

8#2 + 6#6

We'll first evaluate the two Prime Factor Counting operations (#) before we proceed with the addition (+).

First, let's find the shared unique prime factors (if any) for the pairs of numbers:

8#2: The number 8 has prime factors 2 × 2 × 2, and the number 2 has a single prime factor which is 2. The shared unique prime factor is 2.
Thus, 8#2 = 1 (since there's one shared prime factor, which is 2).

6#6: The number 6 has prime factors 2 × 3. The shared unique prime factors are 2 and 3.
Thus, 6#6 = 2 (since there are two shared prime factors, which are 2 and 3).

Now we can add the results of the prime factor counting:

8#2 + 6#6 = 1 + 2 = 3.

Therefore, the final answer to the problem is ""The answer is 3."""

4 # 3 + 2

Let’s break down the operations according to the newly revised order of operations PEFMDASC.

- First, we calculate any operations within Parentheses (P), but there are none here.
- Next, we look for any Exponents (E), but there are none in this problem either.
- Then, we perform any Prime Factor Counting (F) operation. 4 has prime factors 2 × 2 (2 squared), and 3 is a prime number itself. They share no common prime factors.
- So, 4 # 3 will result in 0, since there are no shared prime factors.
- After F, we perform any Multiplication (M) or Division (D) from left to right. However, there are no multiplication or division operations in this problem.
- Following M/D, we proceed with Addition (A) and Subtraction (S) from left to right.
- We're left with 0 + 2.
- 0 + 2 equals 2.
- Since concatenation (C) is last, and there is no operation involving concatenation in our problem, we finalize our answer as 2.

Thus, the problem simplifies as follows:

4 # 3 + 2

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: Let's break this down using our updated order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. Parentheses (solve expressions within parentheses first)
2. Exponents (solve exponents next)
3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
4. Multiplication and Division (left to right)
5. Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
6. Concatenation (C, left to right)

Given the expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Let's solve it step by step:

Step 1: Parentheses
You have to add 14 + 4 first:
6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: There are no exponents to solve.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting
Solve 2 # 3:
The prime factors of 2 are just 2 itself, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3 itself. They do not share any prime factors.
So, 2 # 3 = 0.

Our expression now is:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: There are no multiplications or divisions to solve.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction
Now we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:
First, we add 12 to the 6 @ 18, and because concatenation comes last in the order of operations, we do not perform it yet:
6 @ 18 + 12 = 18 + 12
Now we have:
6 @ 30 - 0

Then we subtract 0:
6 @ 30

Step 6: Concatenation
Perform the concatenation operation last:
6 @ 30:
This is just 6 concatenated with 30, which equals 630.

So the final answer is:
The answer is 630."

5. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)
6. Concatenation (C)

Since there are no parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, or concatenation to address, we perform the prime factor counting (F) first:

3 # 2 means we need to count the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 3 and 2. The number 3 has the prime factors {3}, and the number 2 has the prime factors {2}, with no shared prime factors.

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: First, let's use the definition of the Prime Factor Counting operation (F) indicated by the # symbol.

1. Evaluate 8#2:
The prime factors of 8 (|8| since the operation only considers positive values) are 2, 2, and 2.
The prime factors of 2 (|2|) are just 2.
The common unique prime factors of both numbers are simply 2, so there's 1 common unique prime factor.

Therefore, 8#2 = 1.

2. Evaluate 6#6:
The prime factors of 6 (|6|) are 2 and 3.
Since we are comparing the number with itself (6#6), the common unique prime factors would be 2 and 3.
However, the statement of the operation says we are looking for unique prime factors, meaning each prime factor is counted only once regardless of its multiplicity in both numbers.

Therefore, 6#6 = 2

Now, we simply add the results from the prime factor counting operations as per the normal order of operations (PEFMDASC).

1 + 2 = 3

Now the expression becomes:
6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we handle prime factor counting (F):

- Since 2 and 3 are both prime and 3 is a prime factor of itself, there is 1 shared prime factor:

1. Calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) of 8#2: 

To get the unique shared prime factors of 8 and 2, we look at their prime factorizations.
- The prime factorization of 8 is 2^3 (which is 2, 2, and 2)
- The prime factorization of 2 is just 2
The shared unique prime factor here is 2, so there is exactly 1 shared prime factor.

Therefore, 8#2 equals 1.

2. Calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) of 6#6:

To get the unique shared prime factors of 6 and 6:
- The prime factorization of 6 is 2 * 3
- For the same number (6), the prime factorization is still just 2 and 3
Here, there are 2 shared unique prime factors, which are 2 and 3.

Therefore, 6#6 equals 2.

3. Now, add the results (A):

From step 1, we have 8#2 = 1, and from step 2, we have 6#6 = 2. So we add these together:
