First, we evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F) before we do any addition (A):

1. Since the prime factors of \( 8 \) are \( 2 \times 2 \times 2 \) (or \( 2^3 \)) and the prime factors of \( 2 \) are just \( 2 \), they both share the prime factor \( 2 \). Thus, \( 8 \# 2 = 1 \) (since there is one unique shared prime factor \( 2 \)).
2. Next, the prime factors of \( 6 \) are \( 2 \times 3 \). So, \( 6 \# 6 = 2 \) (since there are two unique shared prime factors, \( 2 \) and \( 3 \), because we are looking at the same number's prime factors).

Given problem: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)

8 # 2:
The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2.
The prime factors of 2 are 2.
The unique prime factors shared between 8 and 2 are 2.
So, 8 # 2 equals 1 (since the number 2 is the unique shared prime factor). 

6 # 6:
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
The prime factors of 6 are again 2 and 3.
The unique prime factors shared between 6 and 6 are 2 and 3.
So, 6 # 6 equals 2 (since there are two shared prime factors: 2 and 3).

   - 8 # 2: To find the prime factors of 8 and 2: 
     The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (2^3).
     The prime factor of 2 is just 2.
     The count of unique shared prime factors between 8 and 2 is just 1 (since they share the prime factor 2).
     Thus, 8 # 2 = 1.

   - 6 # 6: To find the prime factors of 6 and 6:
     The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
     Since both numbers are the same, they share all the prime factors. 
     However, we are only counting unique prime factors, so we only count each prime factor once regardless of how many times it appears. 
     Thus, 6 # 6 also has a count of unique shared prime factors of 2 (since they share the prime factors 2 and 3).
     Thus, 6 # 6 = 1 (since we only count the unique prime factors once).

2. Addition (A): We then perform the operation of addition.

The problem given is: 8#2 + 6#6

Step 1: Apply the Prime Factor Counting operation (#), as it comes after parentheses (P) and exponents (E), and before multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction (MDAS).

8#2: The unique prime factors of 8 (2, 2, 2) and of 2 (2) are both 2, so they share one prime factor.
Therefore, 8#2 equals 1 because there is only one unique prime factor they both share.

6#6: The unique prime factors of 6 (2, 3) and itself are both 2 and 3.
Therefore, 6#6 equals 2 because there are two unique prime factors they both share, which are 2 and 3.

Step 2: Now that we have the results of the prime factor counting, we proceed to addition (A).

Let's break down the expression:

8#2: This means we count the number of unique prime factors that 8 and 2 share.
- The prime factorization of 8 is 2^3, meaning the prime factors are {2}.
- The prime factorization of 2 is just 2, meaning the prime factors are {2}.
- The numbers 8 and 2 share one unique prime factor, which is 2.
So, 8#2 = 1.

6#6: This means we count the number of unique prime factors that 6 and 6 share.
- The prime factorization of 6 is 2 * 3, meaning the prime factors are {2, 3}.
- Because it's the same number, the set of prime factors for the other 6 is also {2, 3}.
- The numbers 6 and 6 share two unique prime factors, which are 2 and 3.
So, 6#6 = 2 (since both factors 2 and 3 are shared).

Now we add the results of the prime factor counting:

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Before we solve the given problem, let's recall what the new operation ""Prime Factor Counting (F)"" represents. The operation a#b counts the unique prime factors common to |a| and |b|.

The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (2^3), and for 2, the prime factor is only 2. Since both numbers have 2 as a common prime factor, the result of 8#2 is 1 (since we count unique prime factors).

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since 6 has two different prime factors, and we are considering the number with itself (6#6), it shares both unique prime factors with itself, thus the result of 6#6 is 2 (since 2 and 3 are unique prime factors).

Now let's calculate the original problem 8#2 + 6#6 using the updated order of operations:

Let's evaluate the prime factor counting in the expression: 8#2 + 6#6.

1. Evaluate 8#2:
The absolute value of 8 has prime factors 2 x 2 x 2 (or \(2^3\)). 
The absolute value of 2 has a single prime factor of 2.
The unique shared prime factor is just one number, which is 2. Therefore, 8#2 gives us a count of 1.

2. Evaluate 6#6:
The absolute value of 6 has prime factors 2 x 3. 
Since we're comparing 6 with itself, we're looking at the same set of prime factors, and both numbers have the unique prime factors of 2 and 3.
However, we're counting unique prime factors, and regardless of how many times a prime factor appears, it's counted once. So, we have two unique prime factors in common (2 and 3), making 6#6 equal to 2.

Calculate the expression inside the parentheses first.
(14 + 4) = 18

Now our expression looks like this: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents to calculate in this expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Calculate the prime factor counting operation.
2 # 3 = 0 since 2 and 3 do not share any prime factors.

14 + 4 = 18

So our expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation:
2 and 3 have a common prime factor which is 3, so 2 # 3 = 1 because there is 1 common prime factor.

1. First, we handle the Prime Factor Counting operation (#):
   - 8 has prime factors 2 since 8 = 2^3.
   - 2 is a prime number, so its only prime factor is itself, 2.
   - Thus, 8 and 2 share the prime factor 2, which means 8#2 equals 1 because there's one unique shared prime factor.
   
   - 6 has prime factors 2 and 3 since 6 = 2 * 3.
   - Therefore, 6 shares its own prime factors, which means 6#6 equals 2 because it has two unique prime factors.

  - For 6#6, 6 has the prime factors of 2 and 3 (since 6 = 2 * 3). Given that they are the same number, the shared prime factors are 2 and 3. However, we count unique prime factors, so we have 2 unique factors. Hence, 6#6 yields 2.

- For the term \(6\#6\), the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since it’s the same number, it shares all unique prime factors with itself. So, the shared unique prime factors are 2 and 3.

Therefore, \(8\#2\) gives us 1, and \(6\#6\) gives us 2 (since 2 and 3 are two different prime factors).

Step 1: Parentheses - Evaluate expressions inside parentheses first.
In our expression, there is an addition operation inside parentheses that must be performed before concatenation:
(14 + 4) = 18

Now the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: Exponents - There are no exponents in our expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor counting - Next, we evaluate the Prime Factor counting operation #.
We have 2#3. Since the only prime factor of 2 is 2 and the only prime factor of 3 is 3, there are no shared prime factors, resulting in 0.

So, 2#3 becomes 0.

Now the expression is: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication/Division - There are no multiplication or division operations to perform here.

Step 5: Addition/ Subtraction - Since we have an addition and a subtraction operation, we perform these operations from left to right.

Step 3: Prime Factor counting operation
First, we figure out the prime factors:

- The prime factors of 3 are 3.

There are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3, so:

- The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
- The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.

Next, according to the rules for the operation ""#"", we need to count the unique prime factors shared by each pair of numbers.

6 # 6:

The expression now looks like this: 6@18 + 12-2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents to evaluate in this expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation:

Second, we evaluate the prime factor counting (F):
Since the prime factorization of 2 is 2, and the prime factorization of 3 is 3, they do not share any prime factors.

For \(8#2\), we need to find the unique prime factors of each absolute number and count the common ones.
- Prime factors of \(8\) are 2 (2 * 2 * 2).
- Prime factors of \(2\) are just 2.

Since both numbers share the prime factor 2, we have one common prime factor so \(8#2 = 1\).

For \(6#6\), we also need to find the unique prime factors and count the common ones.
- Prime factors of \(6\) are 2 and 3 (2 * 3).
- Prime factors of \(6\) are again 2 and 3.

All prime factors are shared, but since we count only unique ones, \(6#6 = 2\) because there are two unique prime factors, 2 and 3, that are shared.

- For 8#2:
The absolute values are 8 and 2, and their prime factors are:
8 = 2^3 (prime factors: 2)
2 = 2 (prime factors: 2)
They share the prime factor 2, so 8#2 = 1 (since there is only one shared prime factor).

- For 6#6:
The absolute values are 6 and 6, and their prime factors are:

The prime factors of 2 are 2.
The unique prime factors common to both 8 and 2 include just the prime factor 2 (once).
Therefore, 8#2 = 1.

Now, let's evaluate 6#6:
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
Since we're examining common prime factors between the same number, all prime factors are common.
However, the prime factor counting only considers unique common prime factors (even if a prime factor appears multiple times, it is only counted once). 
Therefore, the unique prime factors common to both 6 and 6 include the factors 2 and 3.
Therefore, 6#6 = 2 (since there are two unique common prime factors: 2 and 3, counted once).

Now, we perform the addition:
1 from 8#2 added to 2 from 6#6 equals 3.

- Prime factors of 2 are 2.

Since 2 is the common prime factor between 8 and 2, the result of 8#2 is 1.

2. Evaluate 6#6:
- Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
- The second 6 has the same prime factors, 2 and 3.

Since the two prime factors (2 and 3) are shared between 6 and 6, the result of 6#6 is 2 (the count of unique shared prime factors).

3. Add the results of the two prime factor counting operations:

2 # 3 analyzes the unique prime factors of 2 and 3. The prime factors of 2 are just 2, and for 3, it is just 3. They do not share any common prime factors.
So, 2 # 3 = 0

The expression now becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication (M) and Division (D)
There is no multiplication or division to be performed.

Step 5: Addition (A) and Subtraction (S)
We perform addition and subtraction from left to right.
12 - 0 = 12

The expression now becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
Finally, we perform the concatenation operation, which is left to right.
6 @ 18 = 618 (since it simply joins the numbers at a digit level)

The answer is 630.","GPT Response: Let's solve the given problem step by step following the revised order of operations PEFMDASC.

Given expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
First, we solve the expression within the parentheses:

\( (14 + 4) \)

This gives us:

\( 18 \)

The expression now becomes:

\( 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 \)

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents in the expression, so we can proceed to the next step.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
We need to evaluate the prime factor counting next. The operation is:

\( 2 # 3 \)

Since 2 and 3 are both prime and do not share any prime factors, the result is:

\( 0 \)

The expression now becomes:

\( 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 \)

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
There's no multiplication or division to carry out, so we move on.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Before we perform the concatenation, we should carry out addition and subtraction in order from left to right:

\( 12 - 0 \)

This gives us:

\( 12 \)

Now the addition:

\( 6 @ 18 + 12 \)

Since addition comes before concatenation in the order of operations, we first add 18 and 12:

\( 18 + 12 = 30 \)

The expression now becomes:

\( 6 @ 30 \)

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
The last step is to perform the concatenation:

\( 6 @ 30 \)

By definition, concatenation is the joining of digits:

\( 630 \)

First, we will evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (#) operation because it comes before addition (A) in the order of operations.

1. Evaluate 8#2
  The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or 2^3)
  The prime factors of 2 are 2
  The count of unique prime factors shared by 8 and 2 is 1 since they only share the prime factor 2.

So, 8#2 = 1

2. Evaluate 6#6
  The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3
  The prime factors of 6 (again) are 2 and 3
  The count of unique prime factors shared by 6 and 6 is 2 since they share both the prime factors 2 and 3.

So, 6#6 = 2

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Let's follow the revised order of operations PEFMDASC to calculate the expression \(8 \# 2 + 6 \# 6\).

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
The first step according to the new order of operations is to perform the prime factor counting operation which we denote with \(\#\).

- For \(8 \# 2\), the prime factors of 8 are \(2 \times 2 \times 2\), and the prime factors of 2 are \(2\). The shared prime factor is \(2\), but since it's the only one, it's counted just once. So, \(8 \# 2 = 1\).
- For \(6 \# 6\), the prime factors of both 6s are \(2\) and \(3\). The count of shared prime factors is \(2\), since both \(2\) and \(3\) are shared.
   
Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\(1 + 2\).

2. Addition (A):
Now we just have to add the results from the prime factor counting operation:

\(1 + 2 = 3\).

Since they don't have any shared prime factors, 2 # 3 equals 0.

Now, the expression becomes:

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
There is no multiplication or division to perform.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)

Step 1: Solve inside Parentheses (P).
(14 + 4) = 18

New expression: 
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Solve Prime Factor Counting (F).
Since 2 and 3 share a prime factor, which is 2:
2 # 3 = 1

New expression:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

Step 3: Perform Concatenation (C).
Now we concatenate 6 and 18:
6 @ 18 = 618

618 + 12 - 1

Step 4: Apply Addition and Subtraction (A/S).
First, we perform the addition and then the subtraction, as they appear left to right:

1. Evaluate prime factor counting (F) first before any addition or subtraction:
   
   a. The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2.
   b. The prime factors of 2 are 2.
   c. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.

Since 8 and 2 share the prime factor 2 (in fact, 2 is the only prime factor of 2), 8 # 2 will give us 1, because there's one unique prime factor that they share.

Similarly, since 6 (prime factors: 2 and 3) is being compared with itself (6 # 6), it shares all its prime factors with itself. However, we only count each prime factor once, so 6 # 6 will also give us 1, because there's one unique prime factor that they share (2 and 3 count as two unique prime factors altogether, but since they are compared within the same number it is still only a single unique prime factor that they share.)

2. Now we add the results of the prime factor counting operations:

   a. 8 # 2 (which is 1)
   b. 6 # 6 (which is 1)

So now the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 becomes:

8 # 2:
- The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or just 2 if considering only unique factors).
- The prime factor of 2 is 2.
- Both numbers share the prime factor 2, so the result of the operation is 1 because there is only one unique shared prime factor.

- The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
- For the second 6, the prime factors are also 2 and 3.
- Both numbers share the prime factors 2 and 3, so the result of the operation is 2 because there are two unique shared prime factors.

First, we need to deal with what's inside the parentheses (14+4):
6@(14+4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6@(18) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents
There are no exponents to deal with in this expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor counting (F)

2. Exponents (E)
There are no exponents to deal with in this problem.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation:

There are no multiplication or division operations to perform.

Step 5: Addition (A) and Subtraction (S)

Given expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Firstly, we need to evaluate what's inside the parentheses (P):

(14 + 4) = 18

The expression now looks like this: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F):

Since the prime factors of 2 are just 2, and the prime factors of 3 include only 3, they share no common prime factors, which means 2 # 3 = 0.

The expression now is: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Now we perform any addition (A) and subtraction (S) from left to right:

12 - 0 = 12

The expression looks like this now: 6 @ 18 + 12

The concatenation (C) comes last, and we will perform this final operation from left to right:

Firstly, we concatenate 6 and 18, which is simply placing 6 and 18 side by side since both are positive:

6 @ 18 = 618

2. Prime Factor Counting (F): Evaluate the counting of unique prime factors between two numbers.

Since 2 and 3 have a common prime factor of 2, the prime factor counting is 1.

6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

3. Multiplication (M) and Division (D): These are not applicable here as there are no multiplication or division operations.

4. Addition (A) / Subtraction (S): These are evaluated next, going from left to right.

Here, we have two operations: addition and subtraction. We must perform them in order, but notice that the concatenation operation comes after addition but before subtraction, so we need to handle this carefully.

First, let's deal with the addition and subtraction that doesn't involve the result of concatenation:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 = 6 @ 30 - 1

5. Concatenation (C): Merging the digits of the numbers comes next.

Step 4: Multiplication (M) and Division (D)
There are no multiplication or division operations in this expression, so we can proceed to the next step.

Step 5: Addition (A) and Subtraction (S)
Before we do addition and subtraction, we need to consider that Concatenation (C) comes after addition and subtraction in our updated order of operations. So we perform addition and subtraction first, adding 12 and subtracting 0:

- The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (2^3).
- The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
- Since 2 is a prime factor shared by both 8 and 2, the result of 8 # 2 is 1.

(14 + 4) = 18

The expression now looks like this: 
6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Exponents (E):
There are no exponents in our expression, so we move on.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F):
Next, we will do the prime factor counting between 2 and 3.
2's prime factor is 2, and 3's prime factor is 3. There are no shared prime factors, so:
2 # 3 = 0

The expression now looks like this:

4. Multiplication/Division (M/D):
There is no multiplication or division to perform, so we move on.

5. Addition/Subtraction (A/S):
Now, let's perform the addition and subtraction from left to right (because they have the same level of precedence).
We can skip directly to addition because the subtraction part was neutralized by prime factor counting.
12 - 0 = 12

The expression now simplifies to:

6. Concatenation (C):
Finally, we perform the concatenation operation. This joins the digits of 6 and 18.

Result for the first term: \( 8\#2 = 1 \)

2. \( 6\#6 \) – The unique prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since both numbers are 6, they share all of their prime factors. Therefore, they have two shared prime factors.

So, we will first calculate 8#2:
8 has prime factors of 2, since \( 8 = 2^3 \).
2 is a prime number itself.
The shared prime factor is 2. Hence, there is 1 shared prime factor. Therefore, \( 8#2 = 1 \).

Next, we calculate 6#6:
6 has prime factors of 2 and 3, since \( 6 = 2 \times 3 \).
Since both numbers are the same, they have the same prime factors, which are 2 and 3.
The shared prime factors are 2 and 3, making a total of 2 unique shared prime factors. Therefore, \( 6#6 = 2 \).

- The prime factors of \( 8 \) are \( 2 \times 2 \times 2 \) (or \( 2^3 \)).
- The prime factors of \( 2 \) are simply \( 2 \).

Since \( 2 \) is the common prime factor, we have one unique prime factor in common. So \( 8#2 = 1 \).

For 6 and 6, we again find the unique prime factors of each:
- The prime factors of \( 6 \) are \( 2 \times 3 \).
- The prime factors of \( 6 \) are \( 2 \times 3 \).

Since \( 2 \) and \( 3 \) are the common prime factors, we have two unique prime factors in common. So \( 6#6 = 2 \).

Step 1: Resolve the expression in parentheses (P):

Let's evaluate this step-by-step:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):

For the term 8#2:
The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (since 8 = 2^3).
The prime factors of 2 are just 2 (since 2 is prime).
The shared prime factors of 8 and 2 are the prime factor(s) 2.
Therefore, 8#2 equals the count of unique shared prime factors, which is 1 (since 2 is the only shared prime factor, and it is counted once).

For the term 6#6:
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 (since 6 = 2 * 3).
The shared prime factors of 6 and itself are the prime factors 2 and 3.
Therefore, 6#6 equals the count of unique shared prime factors, which is 2 (since 2 and 3 are the shared prime factors and each is counted once).

2. Addition:

The prime factors of 8 are: 2, 2, and 2 (or \(2^3\))
The prime factors of 2 are: 2
The prime factors of 6 are: 2 and 3

Now, we apply the Prime Factor Counting operation:

8#2 finds the unique prime factors that are common to both. That’s just 2. Since there's only one prime factor in common, the result is 1.

6#6 finds the unique prime factors that are common to both operands. Since 6 has the prime factors 2 and 3, the common prime factors in 6 and 6 would be both 2 and 3. However, we only count unique prime factors once, the result is 2.

Now we perform the addition. The updated order of operations indicates doing the Prime Factor Counting (F) before Addition (A).

        The prime factor of 2 is 2.
        They share the prime factor of 2. Since the count of unique shared prime factors between 8 and 2 is 1, we have 8 # 2 = 1.

5. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S): We perform the addition and subtraction from left to right. However, we still need to perform the concatenation before these operations.

Now, we proceed with the concatenation (C), which is the last operation in our list:

\(6 @ 18\)

To concatenate, we join the digits of 6 and 18 together:

\(6 @ 18 = 618\)

Now, we proceed with the remaining addition and subtraction:

\(618 + 12 - 0\)

First, add 618 and 12:

\(618 + 12 = 630\)

Then subtract 0, which doesn't change the value:

\(630 - 0 = 630\)

6. Concatenation (C): We've already handled concatenation.

Putting it all together, the final simplified expression is:

\(630\)

So the answer is 630."

The problem given is: 8#2 + 6#6

Following the order:

- First, we do the prime factor counting (F) operation:

The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or 2^3). The prime factor of 2 is 2. Therefore, the prime factor they share is just 2. So, 8#2 equals to counting the number of unique prime factors shared by 8 and 2, which is just one (the prime factor 2).

For 6#6, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since the numbers are the same, the count of unique prime factors they share includes both of these primes. Thus, 6#6 equals to counting the number of unique prime factors shared by 6 and 6, which is two, the prime factors 2 and 3.

So, we have: 8#2 = 1 and 6#6 = 2.

- Then, we perform addition (A):

1 + 2 = 3

So, the final answer is: 3.

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we apply the order of operations PEFMDASC. Since there are no parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, or concatenation explicitly stated in the given problem and the only operations are Prime Factor Counting and Addition, we proceed in the given order:

First we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F):

1. 8#2: Prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (2^3). Prime factors of 2 are just 2.
Since they share the prime factor 2, the count of unique shared prime factors is 1.

2. 6#6: Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since both numbers are the same, they share the same prime factors: 2 and 3.
So, the count of unique shared prime factors is 2.

Now we add the results of the prime factor counting operations:

8#2 + 6#6

The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
The shared prime factor is just 2, so \(8#2 = 1\).

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
The prime factors of 6 (again) are 2 and 3.
All the prime factors are shared, but we're looking for unique prime factors only, which are 2 and 3, so \(6#6 = 2\).

2. Next, addition (A) as per the order of operations:
\[8#2 + 6#6 = 1 + 2 = 3\]

Putting it all together, you have:
\[8#2 + 6#6 = 1 + 2 = 3\]

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 8#2 + 6#6, we must follow the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F)
2. Addition (A)

Let's break it down:

1. We first address the Prime Factor Counting between 8 and 2.
   - The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or 2^3).
   - The prime factors of 2 are just 2.

Since 2 is a common prime factor, there is 1 unique shared prime factor. So, 8#2 evaluates to 1.

2. Next, we perform Prime Factor Counting between 6 and 6.
   - The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
   - Since we are comparing the same number, 6#6 should technically account for the same prime factors (2 and 3).

However, since we are looking for the count of ""unique"" prime factors shared between the two, and it is the same number (hence they share all the prime factors), we only count each prime factor once. So, 6#6 is 2, rather than 4, which would have been the case if we counted each appearance of a shared prime factor.

3. Now we have the simplified expression, which looks like this: 1 + 2.

4. Finally, we perform the addition.

Firstly, we have to evaluate the prime factor counting operations due to PEFMDASC.
8#2 = 1 (since the shared prime factor between |8| (2) and |2| (2) is 2 )
6#6 = 1 (since 6 has only one prime factor, that's 2, shared with itself)

So, the given problem reduces to: 
1 + 1

Following standard and new order of operations, now we perform addition:

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: First, we need to perform the Prime Factor Counting operation (F):

For 8#2, the prime factor of 8 is 2 and the prime factor of 2 is also 2. 
So, by comparing and counting the unique common prime factors, we get 8#2 = 1.

For 6#6, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since we compare the prime factors of same number (6), we need to count all the unique prime factors. 
So, we get 6#6 = 2. 

Substituting the results of Prime Factor Counting operation (F) we get:
1 + 2

To calculate 8#2:
The prime factors of |8| (which is 8 itself) are 2 (2*2*2) and the prime factor of |2| (which is 2 itself) is also 2. Since 2 is the only prime factor common between 8 and 2, the count is 1. So, 8#2 = 1.

To calculate 6#6:
The prime numbers in |6| (which is 6 itself) are 2 and 3. Since the numbers are same in this operation, all the prime factors are shared. So the count is 2. Hence, 6#6 = 2.

Accordingly, the given expression 8#2 + 6#6 becomes 1 + 2.

Next, we look for Prime Factor Counting (F).

8 # 2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2. The prime factors of 2 are just 2. They share the prime factor 2. So, 8 # 2 = 1 because they share one unique prime factor (2).

6 # 6: The prime factors of the first 6 are 2 and 3. The prime factors of the second 6 are also 2 and 3. They share two unique prime factors (2 and 3). So, 6 # 6 = 2 because they share two unique prime factors.

The numbers involved are 8 and 2 for the first # operation, and 6 for both parts of the second # operation.

First, we determine the prime factors:

- The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or \(2^3\)).
- The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
- The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.

Now, let's compute the # operation results:

1. \(8 # 2\):
Since both 8 and 2 share the prime factor 2, the number of unique shared prime factors is 1.

2. \(6 # 6\):
Since the numbers are identical, the count will include all unique prime factors of 6, which are 2 and 3. So, it has 2 unique prime factors.

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
- 8 has prime factors of 2 (2^3).
- 2 has prime factors of 2 (2^1).
- 6 has prime factors of 2 and 3 (2 * 3).

8 # 2 counts the number of unique prime factors they share, which is just 1 (the factor 2).
6 # 6 counts the number of unique prime factors they share, which again is just 1 (the prime factors are 2 and 3, but since we're dealing with the same number, it only counts once).

So we have:
8 # 2 = 1 (because 2 is the shared prime factor)
6 # 6 = 1 (because 2 and 3 are shared, but since it's with itself, it only counts once)

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
First, we evaluate the expression within the parentheses.

6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we calculate the prime factor counting, which comes before addition and subtraction.

2#3 evaluates to the count of unique prime factors shared by 2 and 3. Since the prime factors of 2 are {2} and the prime factors of 3 are {3}, there are no shared prime factors.

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3: Multiplication, Division (M/D)
There is no multiplication or division to be done.

Step 4: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Now, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0
6 @ 30

Step 5: Concatenation (C)
Lastly, we perform the concatenation operation.

6 @ 30 is simple concatenation of 6 and 30, which gives us 630.

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: Apply the Prime Factor Counting operation (PEMDAS order):
2#3 involves checking for common prime factors of 2 and 3. Since 2 and 3 do not share any common prime factors (as 2 has the prime factor 2 and 3 has the prime factor 3), the result is 0. The expression now looks like:

6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents to evaluate in this expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we count the unique prime factors shared between 2 and 3:

2 has prime factors: 2

There are no shared factors, so:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

There is no multiplication or division to perform.

   (14 + 4) = 18

   So, the expression becomes:
   6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Prime Factor Counting (F): Next, we calculate the prime factor counting.
   2 # 3 = 0 (since 2 has the prime factor 2, and 3 has the prime factor 3; they do not share any prime factors)

   Now the expression is:
   6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

3. Multiplication/Division (M/D): There's no multiplication or division to carry out.

4. Addition/Subtraction (A/S): We perform addition and subtraction from left to right.
   18 + 12 = 30 and then 30 - 0 = 30

   However, in this case, we cannot perform addition before handling the concatenation because according to the new rules, concatenation C should be dealt with at the last step after A/S.

   So we wait with performing addition and subtraction, and the expression is still:

1. Evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F):
- The prime factors of 8 are 2 × 2 × 2 (or \(2^3\)).
- The prime factors of 2 are just 2.

Since prime factor counting (\#) comes before addition (+) in the new order of operations, we will evaluate the prime factor operations first:

1. Calculate \( 8 \# 2 \): The prime factor of 8 is 2 (since \( 8 = 2^3 \)), and the prime factor of 2 is itself. Therefore, they share one unique prime factor, which is 2.
So, \( 8 \# 2 = 1 \).

2. Calculate \( 6 \# 6 \): The prime factors of the first 6 are 2 and 3, and the same applies for the second 6. Therefore, they share two unique prime factors, which are 2 and 3.
So, \( 6 \# 6 = 2 \).

Now plug these values back into the original expression:

1. Calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) first as it comes before addition (A) in our order of operations.

   a) For 8 # 2: The prime factors of |8| are 2, 2, and 2. The prime factors of |2| are just 2. The number of unique prime factors shared by 8 and 2 is 1 (since 2 is the only prime factor and it is shared).

   b) For 6 # 6: The prime factors of |6| are 2 and 3. The prime factors of the second |6| are also 2 and 3. The number of unique prime factors shared by 6 and 6 is 2 (since both 2 and 3 are shared).

2. Perform the addition (A) last because it is executed after all other operations except for concatenation (C), which is not part of this problem.

Given problem: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Let's break it down step by step, keeping the updated order of operations in mind:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):
   - For 8 # 2, the prime factors of |8| are 2, and the prime factors of |2| are also 2. Therefore, there's 1 unique shared prime factor, which is 2. So, 8 # 2 = 1.
   - For 6 # 6, the prime factors of |6| are 2 and 3, and since both numbers are the same, there is 1 shared prime factor, which is 2. Therefore, 6 # 6 = 1.

2. Addition (A):
   - After prime factor counting, we perform the addition. We add the results from the previous step (which are both 1). So, we have 1 + 1 = 2.

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting
Next, we calculate the prime factor counting operation (F). Prime factors of 2 are 2, and prime factors of 3 are 3. So, there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3, so result of 2 # 3 is 0.

First, there are no parentheses or exponents to evaluate, so we move onto the Prime Factor Counting operation.

1. Evaluate 8 # 2:
8 has the prime factors 2 * 2 * 2.
2 has the prime factor 2.
Shared prime factors: 2 (just the number itself since it's the only prime factor of 2)

2. Evaluate 6 # 6:
6 has the prime factors 2 * 3.
6 also has the prime factors 2 * 3.
Shared prime factors: 2 and 3.

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): We perform prime factor counting first before addition.

- The prime factors of \(8\) are \(2, 2,\) and \(2\).
- The prime factors of \(2\) are \(2\).

Therefore, \(8 \# 2\) counts the number of unique prime factors that \(8\) and \(2\) share which is \(1\) (since they both share the prime factor \(2\)).

- The prime factors of \(6\) are \(2\) and \(3\).
- As \(6\) has the prime factors \(2\) and \(3\), but since \(6 \# 6\) is comparing the number with itself, it includes all the unique prime factors that it has.

Therefore, \(6 \# 6\) is saying how many unique prime factors does \(6\) have, which is \(2\) (prime factors \(2\) and \(3\)).

\( 6 \# 6 \): The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since we're looking for the count of unique prime factors shared between the same number (6), the result is 2 (since we have both prime factors 2 and 3).

1. Parentheses (P): First, we compute the expression within the parentheses.

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Prime Factor Counting (F): Next, we apply the prime factor counting operation.

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

3. Multiplication and Division (M/D): There are no multiplication or division operations to perform.

4. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Perform the addition operation next.

6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): We evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operation before other operations.

For ""8 # 2"":
- The unique prime factors of 8 are 2 (since 8 = 2^3).
- The unique prime factors of 2 are 2 (since 2 is a prime number).
- The shared prime factors of 8 and 2 is just 2, so there's only 1 shared factor.
Thus, 8 # 2 = 1.

For ""6 # 6"":
- The unique prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 (since 6 = 2 * 3).
- The unique prime factors of 6 are the same as above, 2 and 3.
- The shared prime factors of 6 and 6 are 2 and 3, so there are 2 shared factors.
Thus, 6 # 6 = 2.

2. Addition (A): Now perform the addition operation.

So now the expression is 1 + 2, which equals 3.

Putting everything together, we get:
8 # 2 + 6 # 6 
= 1 + 2 
= 3.

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: To solve the given expression ""8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"" we have to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation before addition, as per the new order of operations PEFMDASC.

Let's look at the prime factors to perform the prime factor counting for each term: 

8 = 2^3 (The prime factors of 8 are 2)
2 = 2 (The prime factors of 2 are 2)
Since both terms share the prime factor 2, the count of unique shared prime factors will be 1.

6 = 2 * 3 (The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3)
6 again is the same as above.
Since 6 shares all its prime factors with itself, in this case, 2 and 3, the count of unique shared prime factors will be 2.

Now we perform the prime factor counting and addition:

8 # 2 = 1
6 # 6 = 2

Substituting these values back into the original expression gives us:

1 + 2

We simply add these two numbers together:

1 + 2 = 3

Therefore, the answer to the given expression is 3.

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Let's solve the given problem step by step according to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

**Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)**
- \( 8 # 2 \): The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2. The prime factors of 2 are just 2. Since there's 1 unique shared prime factor, which is 2, then \( 8 # 2 = 1 \).
- \( 6 # 6 \): The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since they share the same prime factors, but there's a mistake in the original problem statement where it stated that the prime factors of 4 are 5 and the prime factors of 16 are 2. Considering that the problem statement likely meant to say the unique count of prime factors for 16 and 4 would be 1, let's apply the same logic here. The unique count of common prime factors between 6 and 6 would hence be 2 because of 2 and 3. 

**Step 2: Addition (A)**
Now we simply add the results of the prime factor counting operations:
\( 1 + 2 = 3 \)

Putting it all together, we have solved the problem:

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the PEFMDASC order of operations, we need to handle the prime factor counting (#) first before moving on to addition. Here are the steps:

1. Evaluate 8 # 2: 
We find the unique prime factors of both numbers. The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (since 8 = 2^3). The prime factors of 2 are just 2, since 2 is a prime number itself.

There is a shared prime factor of 2 between 8 and 2.

Hence, 8 # 2 = 1 (since they share exactly one prime factor, which is 2)

2. Evaluate 6 # 6: 
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 (since 6 = 2 * 3). For the number 6 itself, this doesn't change.

Since both instances of the number 6 share the prime factors of 2 and 3, we count the unique prime factors which are 2 and 3.

Hence, 6 # 6 = 2 (because there are two shared unique prime factors, 2 and 3)

3. Add the results of prime factor counting:
Now we combine the results from step 1 and step 2 together using addition.

Next, there are no more expressions within parentheses nor exponents to solve, so we can move to the Prime Factor Counting operation. For that, we have to find answer of ""2#3"". Since the only prime factor of 2 is 2 and of 3 is 3 and there are no shared prime factors, ""2#3"" equals 0. 

Replacing that in the equation, the expression becomes:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Next, based on the order of operations, we have to perform multiplication or division (if any), but there's none in the equation.   
So we move further to the next operation which is addition or subtraction. ""18 + 12"" = 30. 

So the expression simplifies to:

6 @ 30 - 0

Subtraction comes next. ""30 - 0"" equals 30. Therefore, the expression is now:

6 @ 30

Finally, the Concatenation operation is last. The operation ""6 @ 30"" will give result 630 as it combines the numbers 6 and 30.

Therefore, the final answer to the given mathematics problem ""6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3"" is 630.

The answer is 630.","GPT Response: According to the order of operations PEFMDASC, operations enclosed in parentheses should be done first. 

First Step:
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3
=6 @ 18 + 12 - 1  (since 2 and 3 have a common prime factor, which is 2.)

Now we will perform the remaining operations according to the order.

Second Step:
= 618 + 12 - 1 (since concatenation ""C"" is the next operation)

Third Step:
= 630 - 1 (since addition ""A"" is next in the order of operations)

Final Step:
= 629 (since subtraction ""S"" is the last)

So, the answer is 629.","GPT Response: The first step is to solve the operations in the parentheses:

6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Next, following the new operations order, we proceed with Prime Factor Counting (F):

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 
   (Since the prime factor of 2 is 2 and the prime factors of 3 are 3, and there are no shared prime factors, hence 2#3 = 0.)

Now, perform the addition:

= 6 @ 18 + 11

We now perform the concatenation (C), which is done next according to the order:

= 618 + 11

Next proceed with normal addition to get the final result:

So, the given mathematical expression equals 629. 

The answer is 629.","GPT Response: Let's solve the given expression step by step using PEFMDASC order of operations (Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction, Concatenation). 

The expression is: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

Step 1: P (Parentheses)
First, according to the PEFMDASC order, we solve what is inside the Parentheses.

So, 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3 
becomes 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: F (Prime Factor Counting)
Next, we do the Prime Factor Counting. 

The only Prime Factor Counting operation in our expression is 2 # 3.
Prime factors of 2 = 2, and prime factors of 3 = 3. There are no shared prime factors, so 2 # 3 = 0.
So, 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3
becomes 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0.

Step 3: A/S (Addition and Subtraction from left to right)
Next, according to PEFMDASC, addition and subtraction are solved from left to right.

Firstly, we perform the addition operation 6 @ 18 + 12,
which becomes 6 @ 30.

Next we perform the subtraction operation 6 @ 30 - 0,
which becomes 6 @ 30.

Step 4: C (Concatenation)
Finally, the last operation to be performed is Concatenation (C).

Thus, 6 @ 30 = 630.

So the final answer to the problem is:
The answer is 29.","GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem:

5 + 2 @ 4

We will follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Parentheses (P)
2. Exponents (E)
3. Prime Factor counting (F)
4. Multiplication (M) and Division (D) (left to right)
5. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S) (left to right)
6. Concatenation (C) (left to right)

In our expression, there are no parentheses, exponents, prime factor counting, multiplication, or division. We only need to focus on addition and concatenation. According to the order of operations, we perform addition before concatenation.

However, looking more closely at the operation precedence list, concatenation (C) actually comes after addition. This adjustment was likely an oversight in my initial reading. Let's re-evaluate the precedence:

5 + 2 @ 4

With concatenation taking precedence over addition, we first concatenate 2 and 4:

2 @ 4 = 24

Now, we perform the addition:

5 + 24 = 29

Therefore, the correct evaluation of 5 + 2 @ 4 following the order of operations with concatenation last is:

Starting with the prime factor counting operation:

\(3 \# 2\) represents the number of unique prime factors shared by absolute values of 3 and 2. The number 3 has the prime factor 3, and the number 2 has the prime factor 2. Since they do not share any prime factors, the result of \(3 \# 2\) is 0.

1. (P) Parentheses: Evaluate expressions inside parentheses first.
   In this case, we need to compute 14+4:
   14 + 4 = 18
   ⇒ 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

2. (E) Exponents: There are no exponents in the expression.

3. (F) Prime Factor Counting: Evaluate the prime factor counting operation next.
   To find 2#3, we count the number of unique prime factors shared by 2 and 3.
   2 has the prime factor 2, and 3 has the prime factor 3, so they do not share any prime factors:
   2#3 = 0
   ⇒ 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

4. (M) Multiplication: No multiplication in the expression.
   (D) Division: No division in the expression.

5. (A) Addition: Perform addition next.
   But before we can perform addition, we need to handle the concatenation since it's part of the expression inside parentheses.

6. (C) Concatenation: Perform concatenation operations from left to right.
   Since concatenation appears in the expression after evaluating parentheses, we can perform it now. Concatenate 6 and 18:
   6 @ 18 = 618
   ⇒ 618 + 12 - 0

7. Now proceeding with the remaining operations from left to right (Addition/Subtraction):
   618 + 12 = 630
   630 - 0 = 630

   \( (14+4) = 18 \)

   So the expression becomes:
   \( 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3 \)

2. Prime Factor Counting (F):
   Next, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation:
   \( 2#3 \)
   Since 2 has prime factors [2], and 3 has prime factors [3], there are no shared prime factors, thus:
   \( 2#3 = 0 \)

   Now our expression is:
   \( 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 \)

3. Multiplication/Division (M/D):
   There is no multiplication or division to compute here.

4. Addition/Subtraction (A/S):
   Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
   \( 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 \)
   \( (6 @ 18) + 12 \)
   We postpone concatenation because it comes after addition in order of operations.

   Perform the addition:
   \( 12 + 0 = 12 \)
   
   So now we have:
   \( 6 @ 18 + 12 \)

5. Concatenation (C):
   Finally, we apply the concatenation operation:
   \( 6 @ 18 \)
   To concatenate 6 and 18, we simply put their digits together to get 618.

Let's find the prime factors of 8 which are 2, 2, and 2 (or 2^3) and the prime factors of 2 are just 2.

8 # 2 = (since the only prime factor of 2 is counted once, regardless of the multiplicity in 8's prime factors)

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we perform the counting of shared prime factors between 2 and 3. 
The prime factors of 2 is 2, and the prime factors of 3 is 3. As 2 and 3 are both prime numbers, they don't share any prime factors.

- We count the unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 8 and 2.
8 = 2^3 and its prime factors are {2}
2 = 2^1 and its prime factors are {2}
There is 1 shared prime factor.

So, 8 # 2 = 1

Let's evaluate each one:

1. \( 8 \# 2 \)
The prime factorization of 8 is \(2 \times 2 \times 2\), which is \(2^3\).
The prime factorization of 2 is 2.
The shared prime factor between 8 and 2 is just 2. Thus, \( 8 \# 2 = 1 \) because there is one shared prime factor.

2. \( 6 \# 6 \)
The prime factorization of 6 is \(2 \times 3\).
Since both numbers are the same, the shared prime factors are the factors of 6 itself, which are 2 and 3. Thus, \( 6 \# 6 = 2 \), because there are two shared prime factors (2 and 3).

Given expression: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

First thing to note is the Prime Factor Counting (#) comes before Addition (+). So, we calculate the Prime Factor Counting operations first:

Step 1. 8 # 2 (Prime Factor Counting)
The prime factors of 8 are 2. 
The prime factors of 2 are also 2. 
So, they share one prime factor, which is 2. Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1.

The expression becomes: 1 + 6 # 6

Step 2. 6 # 6 (Prime Factor Counting)
Since they are same numbers, they will have same prime factors. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. 
Thus, they share two prime factors. Therefore, 6 # 6 = 2.

The expression becomes: 1 + 2

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
We prioritize the prime factor counting operation.
2 # 3, since the prime factors of 2 are {2} and the prime factors of 3 are {3}, there are no shared prime factors.
2 # 3 = 0

Now the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication (M) and Division (D)
There are no multiplication or division operations to perform.

Step 5: Addition (A) and Subtraction (S)
Before we can perform addition and subtraction, we need to address any concatenation operations that come after them in the order of operations.

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
We have a concatenation operation to perform: 6 @ 18
Concatenation joins the digits of 6 and 18 together.
6 @ 18 = 618

Now the expression becomes: 618 + 12 - 0

Step 7: Addition and Subtraction
Since we're now only left with addition and subtraction, we can perform them from left to right.
618 + 12 = 630
630 - 0 = 630

The final answer is 630."

The expression is: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

First, we tackle the prime factor counting (#) operations since they come before addition in the order of operations.

1. Evaluate 8 # 2: 
The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (2^3). 
The prime factors of 2 are just 2. 
They share the prime factor 2.
Since they share only one unique prime factor (which is 2), the result for this portion of the expression is 1.

2. Evaluate 6 # 6:
The prime factors of the first 6 are 2 and 3.
The prime factors of the second 6 are also 2 and 3.
They share the prime factors 2 and 3. However, the operation counts unique shared prime factors, which are 2 and 3, resulting in a count of 2.

Now, with the results of the # operations, the expression becomes:

1 + 2

Next, we evaluate the addition:

1 + 2 = 3

1. Prime Factor Counting (F) — We need to find the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of each pair of numbers involved in the # operation.

8 # 2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (8 = 2^3). The prime factor of 2 is 2. Since they share the prime factor 2, the count is 1.
6 # 6: The prime factors of the first 6 are 2 and 3. The prime factors of the second 6 are also 2 and 3. Since they share two prime factors, 2 and 3, the count is 2.

2. Addition (A) — With the results from the prime factor counting operation, we proceed to add the values.

(8 # 2) + (6 # 6)
= 1 + 2

Therefore, after performing the operations step by step according to the new order, the answer to the problem is 3.

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Let's evaluate the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 following the updated order of operations PEMDAS (where F is for Prime Factor Counting):

1. Calculate prime factor counting (F) before moving on to addition (A).
2. Perform addition (A) as the last step, since there are no parentheses (P), exponents (E), multiplication (M), division (D), subtraction (S), or concatenation (C) to consider in this expression.

The expression is:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6

First, we look at the prime factorization of each number:

- Prime factors of 8 are 2 x 2 x 2.
- Prime factors of 2 are 2.
- Only the number 2 is a shared prime factor between 8 and 2, so 8 # 2 results in 1.

Then we have:

6 # 6

- Prime factors of 6 are 2 x 3.
- Since both numbers are the same, they share the same prime factors, so 6 # 6 results in counting the unique prime factors in the prime factorization of 6 which are 2 and 3, so we have 2 unique prime factors so 6 # 6 results in 2.

Now, we can replace the prime factor counts in the expression:

1 + 2

Now we just need to perform the addition:

So, 8 # 2 = 1 (since there is only 1 unique shared prime factor, which is 2).

For 6 # 6:
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
The prime factors of the second 6 are also 2 and 3.
The shared prime factors are 2 and 3.
So, 6 # 6 = 2 (since there are 2 unique shared prime factors, which are 2 and 3).

The answer is 629.","GPT Response: Let's break down your problem 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 using the new order of operations PEFMDASC.
 
The first step is to deal with Parentheses:

The next steps in PEFMDASC are Exponents and Prime Factor Counting, but they do not appear in the problem, so we can skip it. The next operation is Multiplication and Division but they do not appear in the problem as well, so we move on to Addition and Subtraction:

Next within ""PEFMDASC"" comes Prime Factor Counting:

= 6 @ 30 - 1
    [Since the prime factors of 2 are {2} and those of 3 are {3}; hence there are no shared prime factors and the count is 0.]

= 6 @ 29 
  [Since we calculate subtraction before concatenation, 30 - 1 results in 29.]

The answer is 629.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we will follow the PEFMDASC order of operations, step by step:

1. Parentheses (P): First, we calculate the expression within the parentheses.
2. Exponents (E): Not applicable here, as there are no exponents in the expression.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We will calculate this after we address the parentheses.
4. Multiplication (M) and Division (D): Again, not applicable here, as there are no multiplication or division operations in the expression.
5. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S): To be handled after the parentheses.
6. Concatenation (C): To be executed last, after the addition and subtraction.

Now, let’s apply the above steps to the expression:

Expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1 - Parentheses:
(14 + 4) 
= 18

The expression now looks like this:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2 - Prime Factor Counting:
2 # 3
The prime factors of 2 are just 2, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3. No shared prime factors, so the result is 0.

The expression now is:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3 - Addition:
18 + 12
= 30

After this step, the expression is:
6 @ 30 - 0

Since there is no actual subtraction to be done (subtracting 0 has no effect), we can simplify this to:
6 @ 30

Step 4 - Concatenation:
We join the digits of 6 and 30 together:
= 630

So, after evaluating the entire expression, we arrive at the final answer:

To solve this, we apply the operations in the following order:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F)
2. Addition (A)

Starting with prime factor counting, we have:
- 8 # 2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (since 8 = 2^3), and the prime factors of 2 are just 2. They share the prime factor 2, so the result is 1.
- 6 # 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and since we are comparing the number with itself, all prime factors are shared. However, we need to consider unique prime factors, which are 2 and 3. Therefore, the result is 2 (since there are two unique prime factors, 2 and 3, that are shared).

The prime factors of 2: 2 (since 2 is a prime number)

The prime factors of 6: 2, 3 (since 6 = 2 * 3)

Now we count the unique shared prime factors:

- For 8 # 2, the shared unique prime factor is just 2 (count is 1).
- For 6 # 6, the prime factors are the same since both numbers are the same (count is 2, since 2 and 3 are the unique prime factors of 6).

2. Perform Prime Factor Counting (F)

8 # 2 = 1 (there is 1 unique shared prime factor)
6 # 6 = 2 (there are 2 unique shared prime factors since the numbers are identical)

The expression is now 1 + 2.

3. Addition (A)

Now we perform the addition of the values obtained from prime factor counting:

Let's start by performing the prime factor counting (#) operation:

- The number 3 has one prime factor, i.e., 3.
- The number 2 has one prime factor, i.e., 2.
- These two numbers share no common prime factor.

So, 3 # 2 = 0

The next step is to perform the addition operation:

5 + 0 = 5

Thus, the final answer to the mathematics problem 5 + 3 # 2, considering the updated order of operations, is 5.

So, the answer is 5.","GPT Response: Following the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

First we calculate the prime count operation (F):

Therefore, the result is 6.

""The answer is 6.""","GPT Response: In the given math problem, you have the operations addition and prime factor counting.

Given our Order of Operations (PEFMDASC), we solve Prime Factor Counting (F) before Addition (A):

Starting with 3 # 2, 3 and 2 are both primes and thus, they do not share any common factor. Hence, 3 # 2 = 0

We start by simplifying what's inside the parentheses, followed by the prime factor counting operation and the subtraction.

6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3 
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3 (simplify inside parentheses 14+4 = 18)
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 (since prime factor of 3 are [3], and prime factor of 2 are [2]. Hence there are no shared prime factor, i.e., 2#3 = 0)
= 618 + 12 - 0
= 630 - 0 (using addition before subtraction)
= 630 (since 630 - 0 = 630)

Hence the final answer to the problem within the context of new operations and order of operations is 630.
""The answer is 630.""","GPT Response: First, evaluate what is in the parenthesis according to the order of operations (PEFMDASC). So, 14 + 4 = 18.

So we get: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Then, perform the addition operation (A) according to the new rules.

So, we get: 6 @ 18 + 12 = 6 @ 30

Finally, perform the concatenation operation (C), which according to the updated rules is done last.

So, 6 @ 30 = 630.

So, the answer to the given problem 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3 according to the new mathematical operation rules is 630.

Therefore, the answer is 630.","GPT Response: First, we evaluate the expression in parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18.

So now, the expression is: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Afterwards, we count the shared unique prime factors between 2 and 3 using the F operation. Given that 2 is prime and 3 is also prime, there is no shared prime factor, so 2#3 equals 0.

So now, the expression is: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 

Solving from left to right according to the order of operations (PEFMDASC), we perform the addition operation next: 12 - 0 = 12

So now the expression is: 6 @ 18 + 12 

Again, according to the order of operations (PEFMDASC), we perform the concatenation:

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
In our case: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
Let's solve parentheses:
14 + 4 = 18 

We then replace (14+4) in the expression with 18. The updated expression is now:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Let's calculate the prime factors in the expression: 2#3
The unique prime factors of |2| are 2
The unique prime factors of |3| are 3
They do not share any prime number.
So, 2 # 3 = 0 

We replace 2 # 3 in the expression with 0.
The expression becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Steps 3 & 4: Exponentiation, Multiplication, and Division (E, M/D)
There are no exponentiations, multiplications, or divisions in the new expression, so we proceed to the next step.

Step 5: Addition & Subtraction (A/S)
From left to right:
Firstly, let's perform addition 18 + 12 = 30

So the updated expression becomes:
6 @ 30 - 0

Now, let's perform the subtraction operation 30 - 0 = 30

So, the updated expression becomes:
6 @ 30

Similarly, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 and the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, so 6 # 6 = 2 because they share two prime factors, 2 and 3.

neutral,16,gpt-4-0613,1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: In the problem, the two operations you need to perform are the prime factor counting operation and the addition operation.

Firstly, you would calculate the primary factor count of numbers:

1. The prime factor of 8 is 2 (2x2x2), and the prime factor of 2 is 2. They share one prime factor in common hence 8 # 2 = 1.
2. The prime factor of 6 is 2 and 3. Here, 6 # 6 refers to the count of unique prime factors shared by the same number, 6. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, so it shares 2 prime factors with itself, hence 6 # 6 = 2.

The problem can now be simplified to:

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: First, we will calculate 8 # 2 (prime factor counting) and 6 # 6 separately, according to the order of operations, PEFMDASC. F comes before A (addition), so this is the order.

The only prime factor of 8 (which is 2) is shared with 2, so the value of 8 # 2 is 1.

For 6 # 6, since both numbers are the same, they share the same prime factors. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. So, there are 2 unique prime factors, meaning the value of 6 # 6 is 2.

Now, deal with the addition: 1 + 2

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: According to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC):

First, apply the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation:

8 # 2 = 1 (since 2 is the only prime factor shared by 8 and 2)

Finally, solve addition to get 1 + 1 = 2

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: Following the PEFMDASC order of operations, let's solve the problem: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

First, we should carry out Prime Factor Counting operations:

(ii) 8 # 2
The unique prime factors of 8 are 2 (since 8 = 2^3), and the unique prime factors of 2 are also 2. 

So, 8 # 2 = 1 (since they share 1 common unique prime factor, which is 2.)

(iv) 6 # 6
The unique prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and for the same number (which is 6), the prime factors will also be 2 and 3.

So, 6 # 6 = 2 (since they share 2 common unique prime factors, which are 2 and 3.)

Now, replace the Prime Factor Counting operations with the corresponding values we found:

Original: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6
After Prime Factor Counting: 1 + 2

Next, perform Addition, which will give us the final result.

Adding the values together gives us:

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Then, we perform the prime factor counting operation:

Step 2: There is no Exponents operation in the equation; move to the next step, Prime Factor Counting.

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (since 2 and 3 both share only one prime factor: 2)

Step 3: There is no Multiplication or Division operation; move straight to Addition / Subtraction.

= 6 @ 18 + 11  (since 12 - 1 = 11)

Finally, perform the Concatenation:

Problem: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1 (Parentheses): We deal with the parentheses first. 
In the given problem, (14 + 4) is within parentheses. So, we perform this operation first. 
14 + 4 = 18
So, the problem is now: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2 (Exponents): There are no exponents in the problem so let's go to the next step. 

Step 3 (Prime Factor Counting):
The Prime Factor Counting (F) operation is next in the order. We find 2 # 3.
The prime factors of 2 are just 2, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3. So, the number of common factors is 0.
So, replace 2 # 3 with 0. 
This modifies our problem to: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4 (Multiplication/Division):
There are no Multiplication and Division operations to perform in the problem, hence proceed to the next step.

Step 5 (Addition/Subtraction): 
Now, perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right. 
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 = 6 @ 18 + 12 = 6 @ 30. 
This simplifies the problem to: 6 @ 30

Starting with the operation (F): Prime Factor Counting
We calculate 8 # 2 and 6 # 6.

Prime factor of 8 is 2, and we can clearly see the only prime factor of 2 is also 2. Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1. 

Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since 6 shares all its prime factors with itself, 6 # 6 = 2.

6 # 6 = 1 (since we have only one number, its prime factor would be considered as a shared prime factor)

So we substitute and the expression becomes:

1 + 1

The prime factors of 3 are just 3, and the prime factors of 2 are just 2. They share no common factors, so 3 # 2 = 0.

The expression simplifies to 5 + 0 = 5.

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: First, we must look at the new operation and find the number of unique prime factors that are common between 3 and 2. 

Observe that:

Prime factors of 3: 3
Prime factors of 2: 2 

There are no common prime factors between 3 and 2.

Hence, 3 # 2 = 0. 

So, the expression becomes 5 + 0.

Lastly, following the normal rules of addition:

5 + 0 = 5

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: Let's workout this problem step-by-step using the newly revised order of operations, PEFMDASC.

Given expression: 5 + 3 # 2

According to the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we know that prime factor counting (F) takes precedence over addition (A), so we perform the operation 3 # 2 first.

To do this, we need to calculate the count of unique prime factors shared between |3| and |2|. 

The prime factor of 3 is 3, and the prime factor of 2 is 2, and hence they do not share any common prime factors. Therefore, 3 # 2 = 0.

Now our expression becomes: 5 + 0

After that, according to PEFMDASC, the addition operation is next. So,
5 + 0 = 5.

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

First, we evaluate the part in parenthesis (Because Parentheses comes first in order operations)
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we follow the order of operations to perform the prime factor counting operation before addition or subtraction:
Since 2 and 3 both have one prime factor which is 2 in common
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

Next, considering the order of operations, we do the addition before concatenation:
= 6 @ 30 - 1

We then perform the concatenation operation:
= 630 - 1

Finally, we perform the subtraction operation:
= 629 

The answer is 629.","GPT Response: Firstly, the parentheses need to be addressed. The operation in the parentheses is addition, which results in 14 + 4 = 18.

So, the operation 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 becomes 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3.

Next, the prime factor counting is calculated: 2 # 3 = 0, as 2 and 3 are both prime numbers but they do not share any prime factors.

Thus, the equation is now 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0.

Then, the concatenation is performed: 6 @ 18 = 618.

Therefore, the equation becomes 618 + 12 - 0.

Then, follow the standard order of operations: addition before subtraction. First, add 618 and 12 to get 630.

So, the equation becomes 630 - 0.

Lastly, subtract 0 from 630, which results in 630.

So, the answer is 630.","GPT Response: To solve this equation, we need to follow the new order of operations PEFMDASC correctly.

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
The equation becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
The equation becomes: 
6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (since prime factors of 2 are 2 and prime factor of 3 is also 2, meaning they share one common prime factor.)

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Do addition and subtraction from left to right:
First, add 18 and 12: 
6 @ 30 - 1 
Then, subtract 1 from 30: 
6 @ 29

Step 4: Concatenation (C)
Finally, concatenate 6 and 29: 
629 

So, the full step-by-step calculation is: 
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1
= 6 @ 30 - 1
= 6 @ 29
= 629

The answer is 629.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to use the revised order of operations PEFMDASC.

Step 1: Parentheses
The first term that needs to be resolved is within the parenthesis: (14 + 4)
14 + 4 = 18

So the expression after this step becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting
The next operation to be performed according to PEFMDASC is prime factor counting: 2 # 3
2 and 3 are both prime numbers but they are not the same number. Hence, they don't share any common prime factors. So, 2 # 3 = 0 

Now our expression looks like: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction
According to our new order of operations, addition and subtraction should be performed next. Here we have both: 18 + 12 - 0

First we do 18 + 12 = 30 and then subtract the resultant from 0 so our operation becomes: 30 - 0 = 30

So, now our expression becomes: 6 @ 30

Step 4: Concatenation
The final operation remaining as per PEFMDASC is concatenation: 6 @ 30
Perform the operation joining the digits together.

So, 6 @ 30 = 630.

To summarize:

The solution for the expression 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3, based on the new rules, is 630.

2. 6 # 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since we are looking for unique shared prime factor, we have two of them which are 2 and 3. So, 6 # 6 = 2.

Replacing the prime factor counting operation in the equation, we get:

3. F: Evaluate Prime Factor counting:
    For the expression 8 # 2, the prime factors of 8 are 2 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. So, they have 1 prime factor in common. So, 8 # 2 equals 1.
    
    Similarly, for the expression 6 # 6, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since both the numbers are the same, they have the same prime factors. The unique prime factors for 6 are 2 and 3. Therefore, 6 # 6 equals 2.

Step 1 - Parentheses - We solve the operation within the parentheses first.
   = 6@(18) + 12-2  #  3

Next Step 2 is Exponents. But since there is no exponent in the given expression, we skip this step.

Step 3 - Prime Factor counting - Here the given expression is 12-2  # 3. Let's handle this:
The prime factors of 10=12-2 (2,5)
The prime factors of 3=(3)
There is no shared prime factor, so the result of 10#3 would be 0.
   = 6@18 + 0.
   
Step 4 and 5 - Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction -
There is no multiplication, division, addition or subtraction now, we move on to the next operation.

Step 6 - Concatenation - Here we see a concatenation operation, 6@18. This would imply joining 6 and 18 together as 618.

3. There are no exponents, multiplication, or division operations to worry about within our current expression.

4. We need to evaluate the Addition (18 + 12) and Subtraction (12 - 0), but since Prime Factor Counting comes before both operations and affects the subtraction part of our expression, we'll need to perform that next:

The answer is 629.","GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step following PEFMDASC order of operations.

Problem: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses
First, we look for expressions in parentheses.
We have (14 + 4).

14 + 4 = 18.

Now, substitute this value back into the expression. Our expression now looks like this: 

=> 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, involve any prime factor counting operations.
Here, we have 2 # 3.

Since prime factors of 2 is 2 and prime factors of 3 is 3, and there are no shared prime factors, thus 2 # 3 = 0. 

Substitute this value back into the expression:

=> 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction 
Then, we handle any addition and subtraction from left to right.
We have 18 + 12 = 30.

Next we need to substitute this value back into the expression:

=> 6 @ 30 - 0

And then 30 - 0 = 30.

Update the expression with this value:

=> 6 @ 30

Step 4: Concatenation (C)
Finally, we arrive at the concatenation operation.
6 @ 30 = 630

Therefore, The answer is 630."

In the expression ""8 # 2 + 6 # 6"", we first handle the prime factor counting operations due to PEFMDASC.
8 has prime factors of 2, and 2 itself is a prime number, so they share 1 prime factor. Thus, 8 # 2 equals 1.
6 has prime factors 2 and 3, and itself has prime factors 2 and 3, therefore, they share two prime factors.  Therefore, 6 # 6 equals 2.

So, the given expression now becomes: ""1 + 2"".

Lastly, we perform the remaining addition:
1 + 2 equals 3.

Thus, The answer is 3.","GPT Response: To solve the problem according to the newly updated order of operations, we first need to resolve the Prime Factor Counting (#) first because F (prime factor count) comes before A (addition) in the order of operations.

8 # 2 
The prime factor of 8 is 2 and the prime factor of 2 is 2. Hence, they have 1 unique prime factor in common. Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1.

6 # 6
The prime factor of 6 is 2 and 3, but since we are comparing with same number 6, the number of unique shared prime factor is basically the unique prime factors of 6. Hence, they have 2 unique prime factors in common. Therefore, 6 # 6 = 2.

Now that we know 8 # 2 = 1 and 6 # 6 = 2, we can proceed to the next operation, which is addition (+).

1 + 2 = 3

Hence the answer to the problem 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 is 3 according to the PEFMDASC order of operations. Therefore,

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: To solve the problem 8 # 2 + 6 # 6, let's follow the updated Order of Operations (PEFMDASC) rule:

1. First, we do the prime factor counting (F):

The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. So 8 # 2 = 1 (since there is only one shared prime factor, which is 2). 

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the other 6's prime factors also are 2 and 3. So 6 # 6 = 2 (since there are two shared prime factors, 2 and 3).

This lets us rewrite the problem like this:

1 + 2

2. Next, we perform the addition (A):

1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Let's solve the problem 8 # 2 + 6 # 6. According to the order PEFMDASC, we need to do the Prime Factor counting operation first, before the addition.

First, 

   evaluate 8 # 2:
   
   The prime factors of 8 are 2, while the prime factors of 2 are also 2. Since they share one unique prime factor (which is 2), 8 # 2 = 1.

So, we rewrite the equation: 1 + 6 # 6

Second, 

   evaluate 6 # 6:
   
   Since 6 is a perfect match with itself, it shares all its prime factors with itself. The prime numbers in 6 are 2 and 3. Therefore, there are two unique prime factors, so 6 # 6 = 2.

Substituting this back into the equation, we get 1 + 2
Finally, we calculate the sum. 

1 + 2 = 3

Therefore, 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 evaluates to 3.

2. Exponents (E)
3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D)
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
6. Concatenation (C) 

So, let's walk through it step by step:

1. Parentheses (P):

   First, evaluate within the parentheses.

   => 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
   => 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

2. Prime Factor Counting (F):

   Next, evaluate the prime factor count.

   In this case, we are counting the number of unique prime factors common to 2 and 3. Since 2 and 3 are both primes themselves and they are unique, the factor count is 0.

   => 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

3. Addition and Subtraction (A/S):

   Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.

   => 6 @ 18 + 12
   => 6 @ 30
   => 6@30

4. Concatenation (C):

   Now, use the concatenation operation, merging the digits of 6 and 30.

   => 630

So, the answer to the problem 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3 using the updated order of operations is 630.

Final Answer: The answer is 630.","GPT Response: We solve this problem following the PEFMDASC order of operations, step by step:

Step 1: Evaluate Parentheses (P)
The expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3.

Step 2: Evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F)
The shared prime factor between 2 and 3 is none. So, 2#3 = 0.
Then, the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0.

Step 3: Evaluate Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
We perform addition between 18 and 12 which becomes 30. Then subtract 0 from 30 which is still 30.
Thus, the expression becomes: 6 @ 30.

Step 4: Evaluate Concatenation (C)
Concatenate 6 and 30, which becomes 630.

Since there are no parentheses, exponents, or prime factor counting involved in this problem, we will move straight to the concatenation operation, which comes last in the order of operations.

According to the concatenation operation (C), 2 @ 4 is the concatenation of the numbers 2 and 4, so:

2 @ 4 = 24

5 + 24 = 29

Therefore, the final answer is 29.

Here is how we will evaluate the expression:

First, perform the addition of 5 and 2:
5 + 2 = 7

Now, perform the concatenation of the result with 4:
7 @ 4 = 74

The answer to 5 + 2 @ 4 is therefore 74.

We have: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

Step 1: Parentheses
First, we will evaluate the expression within the parentheses (14+4):
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: There are no exponents in the expression, so we move on to the next operation.

Given Expression: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): We start by evaluating the prime factor counting operations. Since 8 has prime factors 2 (2 x 2 x 2) and 2 is itself a prime, 8 # 2 results in a count of 1 shared prime factor (2). Similarly, 6 has prime factors 2 and 3, both of which do not match with itself being the prime factor counting with itself, so 6 # 6 results in a count of 0 shared prime factors.

So, 8 # 2 = 1
And 6 # 6 = 0

2. Addition (A): Next, we add the results from the prime factor counting operations.

The expression now becomes: 1 + 0

Prime Factor Counting (F) comes before Addition (A) in the order of operations.

First, we need to find the Prime Factor Counting (F) of each pair of numbers:

8 has prime factors 2 (since 8 = 2^3).
2 has prime factors 2.

8 and 2 share the prime factor 2, so there's 1 unique prime factor shared between 8 and 2.

Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1.

Next,

6 has prime factors 2 and 3 (since 6 = 2 * 3).
Again, 6 has prime factors 2 and 3.

6 and 6 share the prime factors 2 and 3, so there are 2 unique prime factors shared between 6 and 6.

Therefore, 6 # 6 = 2.

The unique prime factors of 8 are 2 (since 8 = 2^3), and the unique prime factors of 2 is obviously 2. Since 2 is a common prime factor, we have:

8 # 2 = 1

Then, we calculate the next Prime Factor Counting operation:

6 # 6

The unique prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since both numbers are the same, the unique prime factors are indeed 2 and 3, so:

6 # 6 = 2 (since there are two shared prime factors: 2 and 3)

Given expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Let's proceed:

1. Evaluate Parentheses:
   (14 + 4) = 18
   The expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Prime Factor Counting:
   2 # 3
   Since 2 has only the prime factor 2, and 3 has only the prime factor 3, they share no common factors.
   So, 2 # 3 = 0
   The expression now becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

First, we will perform the prime factor counting operation (#) on each pair of numbers.

8 # 2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or 2^3); the prime factors of 2 are just 2. The shared unique prime factor is 2. So, 8 # 2 = 1 because there is one shared prime factor (2).

6 # 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3; prime factors of 6 are again 2 and 3. The shared unique prime factors are 2 and 3. Hence, 6 # 6 = 2 because there are two shared prime factors (2 and 3).

First, we do the prime factor counting operation:

Prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2. Prime factors of 2 are just 2. Here, both numbers share the prime factor of 2. So, 8 # 2 = 1.

Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. There's only one prime number (2) or (3) in its prime factorization, so 6 # 6 = 1 since they share the common factors of 2 and 3.

So the equation becomes:

Finally, we perform the prime factor counting operation:

Prime factors of 628 are 2 and 157, and the prime factor of 3 is 3. So, there is no shared prime factor. Hence,

Next, the Prime Factor Counting:
6@18 + 12-2 # 3 = 6@18 + 12-1
(Note: The prime factor for 2 is 2 and the prime factor for 3 is 3. So, they don't share any common factor, hence it is 1)

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
The operation in parentheses is 14+4, which results in 18. 

So, our first step makes our equation look like this: 

6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no operations involving exponents in this equation, so we don't need to do anything here.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Here, we need to count unique prime factors common to 2 and 3. But there are none, so 2 # 3 = 0. 

Here's how our equation looks like now: 

6@18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
There are no multiplication or division operations here.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
We first perform the subtraction operation: 12 - 0, which results in 12.

After that, we perform the addition operation: 12 + 6@18

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
Here, we do the concatenation: 6@18 = 618

So, after performing the concatenation, the operation looks like this:

12 + 618

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
The second operation to be evaluated is Prime Factor Counting, denoted by the '#'. But it doesn't present before the other operations in this expression. So, we move on to the next operation in the order.

Step 3: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
Again, there are not any multiplication or division operations in the current state of this expression, so we move on to the next step in the order.

Step 4: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Addition operation is found in this step. The resulting calculation is:
6@18 + 12 = 6@30

Then the expression becomes:
6@30 - 2#3

Next, we evaluate the concatenation operation, denoted by the '@'. The result of the operation is:
6@30 = 630

Then the expression becomes:
630 - 2#3 

Now, as per the order, we go back to Prime Factor Counting (F) step

Step 6: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we evaluate the prime counting operation. The prime factors of 2 and 3 are 2 and 3 respectively, which are not the same, so 2#3 equals 0.

The answer is 629.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we must follow the order of operations. The updated order of operations prioritized as Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction, and Concatenation.

An initial glance at the problem shows it contains parentheses, prime factor counting, addition, subtraction, and concatenation. Let's break down the steps:

Initial Mathematical Problem: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1 - Parentheses (P):
Inside the parentheses, we have 14 + 4, which equals 18.
So our equation now is: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2 - Prime Factor Counting (F):
Next operation to handle is Prime Factor Counting, denoted by #. To simplify 2 # 3, we're checking for common prime factors. The prime factor of 2 is 2, and the prime factor of 3 is 3, so they have no prime factors in common. This equals 0.
So our equation now is: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3 - Addition and Subtraction (A/S):
Within this step, we perform the operations from left to right. First, we address the addition, 18 + 12 = 30. After this, we address subtraction, 30 - 0 = 30.
So our equation now is: 6 @ 30

Step 4 - Concatenation (C):
Finally, we'll use the Concatenation operation. Concatenation joins the digits together, in this case, 6 and 30 become 630.

Hence, based on the newly updated order of operations: 

The answer is 630.","GPT Response: Given expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F): Next, resolve the Prime Factor Counting operation.
The unique prime numbers for 2 are [2], and for 3 are [3]. They have no common prime factors.
So, 2 # 3 = 0
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Resolve the addition and subtraction from left to right.
= 6 @ 18 + 12
= 6 @ 30

Step 4: Concatenation (C): Finally, resolve the Concatenation operation.

First, we'll do the prime factor counting (F):
- The prime factors of 8 are 2 x 2 x 2 (which is 2 cubed).
- The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
- The prime factors of 6 are 2 x 3.

Since the operation # counts the unique prime factors shared by both numbers, we have:
8 # 2 = 1 (since they share the prime factor 2)
6 # 6 = 1 (since the prime factor of 6 is 2 and 3, they share the same factors so the unique factors count is 1)

Substitute back into the original expression:

1. Evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F):

\( 8 \# 2 \): The prime factors of 8 are \( 2 \times 2 \times 2 \) (which is just 2), and the prime factors of 2 is just 2, so they share the prime factor 2. There is 1 unique prime factor that they share.

\( 6 \# 6 \): The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since it's the same number, it shares all its prime factors with itself. In this case, there are 2 unique prime factors, 2 and 3.

2. Perform the addition (A):

Now, following the revised order, we compute the addition of the results from the prime factor counting:

\( 8 \# 2 + 6 \# 6 = 1 + 2 \)

Therefore, the answer to the problem is:

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: First, we will address the Prime Factor Counting (F), which is now ahead of addition according to the new order of operations PEFMDASC.

Prime Factor Counting for 8 # 2:
- The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (since 8 = 2^3).
- The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
- So, the common unique prime factor is just one number: 2.
Thus, 8 # 2 = 1.

Prime Factor Counting for 6 # 6:
- The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
- Since we are considering the common unique prime factors of 6 with itself, they would also be 2 and 3.
- However, as we need to count unique prime factors, we count each prime factor once, no matter how many times they occur.
Thus, 6 # 6 = 2 (since there are two unique prime factors: 2 and 3).

      They share the prime factor 2, so the result of 8 # 2 is 1 (just one unique prime factor is shared).
   b. Compute 6 # 6:
      Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
      Since both numbers are the same, they share the same prime factors. However, we’re only interested in the count of unique common prime factors. Hence, the result is 1.

Next, we handle the prime factor counting (F):
2 # 3 = 0 (since 2 and 3 do not have common prime factors)

Now the expression looks like:

There are no exponents (E) to resolve.

Moving on to multiplication (M) and division (D), there aren't any terms that need to be multiplied or divided.

Next, we perform addition (A) and subtraction (S):

Solve the expression within the parentheses first:
\(14 + 4 = 18\)

Now the expression looks like this:

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting
Next, we evaluate the prime factor counting between 2 and 3:

- The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (2^3).
- The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
- Since 2 is the common prime factor, the prime factor counting for 8#2 results in 1.

For 6#6:
- The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. 
- As both numbers are the same, the shared prime factors will correspond to all prime factors of 6 without duplicates.

The prime factors of 2 are just 2. 
The unique common prime factor between 8 and 2 is 2. So, 8#2 is the count of unique shared prime factors, which is just 1 (factor of 2).

6#6:
Both numbers are the same, and the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. 
The unique common prime factors between these two numbers are the same as the prime factors of 6 itself, which are 2 and 3. 
However, since we are counting the number of unique prime factors shared, and in this case, all prime factors of 6 are shared with itself, we count each prime factor once. Therefore, 6#6 is equal to 2 (factors of 2 and 3).

Thus, 8 # 2 would count the shared prime factor 2, which is 1.

6 has prime factors 2 and 3.
6 has the same prime factors as the first 6 since it's the same number, 2 and 3.

In this case, since all the prime factors of the first 6 are present in the second 6, 6 # 6 would count both factors, giving us 2.

In the second operation (F) Prime Factor Counting operation, the listed example states that the prime factors of 16 are 2, and the prime factors of 4 are 5, which is incorrect. The prime factor of 4 is 2, not 5.

With that correction in mind, let's evaluate the given mathematical expression: 8#2 + 6#6

Firstly, we need to determine the unique prime factors of the numbers involved:

Prime factors of 8: 2 (since 8 = 2^3)
Prime factors of 2: 2 
Prime factors of 6: 2, 3

Now we use the prime factor counting operation (#):

8#2 counts the number of unique prime factors that 8 and 2 share. Since both have the prime factor 2,
8#2 = 1.

6#6 counts the number of unique prime factors that 6 shares with itself, which are 2 and 3.
6#6 = 2 (since it has two unique prime factors: 2 and 3).

The first operation we see is the Prime Factor Counting (F). We need to perform the prime factor counting on the pairs of numbers before doing any addition.

Let's do the prime factor counting:
1. 8#2 - The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or 2^3). The prime factors of 2 are just 2. The shared prime factor is 2, and since it's only one prime factor, the result of 8#2 is 1.
2. 6#6 - The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since both numbers are the same (6 and 6), all the prime factors are shared. Here, we have two unique prime factors (2 and 3), so the result of 6#6 is 2.

Next, we evaluate 6#6:

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
Since the numbers are identical, they share the same prime factors.
The unique shared prime factors are thus 2 and 3.

4. Multiplication/Division (M/D) from left to right
5. Addition/Subtraction (A/S) from left to right
6. Concatenation (C) from left to right

Here's how we apply it:

Given: \(5 + 3 \# 2\)

The only operation we need to evaluate before addition is the prime factor counting operation \(\#\) because the order of operations states that we should evaluate prime factor counting before addition.

- \(3 \# 2\): First, we need to determine the number of unique prime factors shared by \(3\) and \(2\). Since \(3\) and \(2\) are both prime numbers and do not share any common prime factors, \(3 \# 2 = 0\).

Now, we simply add this result to \(5\):

\(5 + 0 = 5\)

So the final answer is:
The answer is 5.","GPT Response: Evaluating the problem using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

5 + 3 # 2

We first look for any operations that involve parentheses (P), exponents (E), or prime factor counting (F). There are no parentheses or exponents, but we must address the prime factor counting operation '3 # 2'.

Prime factor counting (F) for '3 # 2':
The prime factor of 3 is 3, and the prime factor of 2 is 2; since they do not share any common prime factors, '3 # 2' equals 0.

The expression now simplifies to:
5 + 0

Following through with addition (A):
5 + 0 = 5

There are no other operations to perform since the rest (M/D for multiplication/division, S for subtraction, and C for concatenation) are not present in this problem.

Therefore, the final answer is:
The answer is 5.","GPT Response: To solve the expression \(5 + 3 \# 2\) using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), let's follow each step:

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses to evaluate.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents to evaluate.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We have \(3 \# 2\). The absolute values of 3 and 2 are used, so we find the unique prime factors of both 3 and 2.

- The unique prime factor of 3 is 3.
- The unique prime factor of 2 is 2.
- There are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2.

So, \(3 \# 2\) evaluates to 0 because there are no shared unique prime factors.

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): No multiplication or division is to be performed.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We now perform the addition operation which includes the result of \(3 \# 2 = 0.\)

\(5 + (3 \# 2) = 5 + 0\)

6. Concatenation (C): There is no concatenation to perform.

Next, we perform addition (A) and subtraction (S):
6 @ 18 + 12 = 6 @ 30
We must perform the addition before we can consider concatenation. We continue with:

First, we need to compute each Prime Factor Counting operation:

8 # 2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or 2^3). The prime factors of 2 is just 2. Therefore, there is 1 shared prime factor: 2.
8 # 2 = 1

6 # 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. The prime factors of 6 for the other operand are the same (since it's the same number). There are 2 shared prime factors (2 and 3).

Let's start with the prime factor counting part (F):

We have two separate prime factor counting operations to evaluate: 8 # 2 and 6 # 6.

- \( 8 # 2 \): The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2. The prime factor of 2 is 2. So, they share the prime factor 2 and there is only one unique prime factor which is 2, which means \( 8 # 2 = 1 \).
- \( 6 # 6 \): The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since both numbers are the same, they share the same prime factors. In this case, there are two unique shared prime factors which are 2 and 3, hence \( 6 # 6 = 2 \).

There are no parentheses in the expression, so we can move on to the next step.

Step 2: Evaluate Exponents
There are no exponents in the expression, so we move on to the next step.

Step 3: Evaluate Prime Factor Counting
We have the expression 2#3, which means we need to count the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of 2 and 3. Both 2 and 3 are prime numbers and they have no shared prime factors. So 2#3 = 0.

Step 4: Evaluate Multiplication and Division (left to right)
There are no multiplication or division operations in the expression, so we move on to the next step.

Step 5: Evaluate Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
We have the expression 14+4. Evaluating from left to right, we get 14+4 = 18.

Step 6: Evaluate Concatenation (left to right)
Now we have 6 @ (18) + 12 - 0. Since concatenation is the last operation to be performed, we can evaluate it.

6 @ 18 = 618 (concatenating the digits of 6 and 18)

So, the expression becomes 618 + 12 - 0.

3. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation (#): Evaluate the prime factor counting next.
   We need to find the count of unique prime factors shared by |2| and |3|.
   The prime factors of 2 are just 2 (since it's a prime number itself).

Given the expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Let's solve it step by step:

Step 1: Parentheses
You have to add 14 + 4 first:
6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: There are no exponents to solve.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting
Solve 2 # 3:
The prime factors of 2 are just 2 itself, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3 itself. They do not share any prime factors.
So, 2 # 3 = 0.

Our expression now is:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: There are no multiplications or divisions to solve.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction
Now we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:
First, we add 12 to the 6 @ 18, and because concatenation comes last in the order of operations, we do not perform it yet:
6 @ 18 + 12 = 18 + 12

Then we subtract 0:
6 @ 30

8#2: The absolute values are considered for the prime factor counting. The number 8's prime factors are 2, 2, and 2 (2^3), and the number 2's prime factor is 2. Since they share the prime factor 2, the count of unique shared prime factors is 1.

6#6: The number 6's prime factors are 2 and 3. Since we are comparing the number with itself, it shares all of its prime factors. However, we are only counting unique prime factors, so despite the number 6 having two prime factors, the count of unique shared prime factors is 2 (2 and 3).

8#2 + 6#6

We'll first evaluate the two Prime Factor Counting operations (#) before we proceed with the addition (+).

First, let's find the shared unique prime factors (if any) for the pairs of numbers:

8#2: The number 8 has prime factors 2 × 2 × 2, and the number 2 has a single prime factor which is 2. The shared unique prime factor is 2.
Thus, 8#2 = 1 (since there's one shared prime factor, which is 2).

6#6: The number 6 has prime factors 2 × 3. The shared unique prime factors are 2 and 3.
Thus, 6#6 = 2 (since there are two shared prime factors, which are 2 and 3).

Now we can add the results of the prime factor counting:

8#2 + 6#6 = 1 + 2 = 3.

Therefore, the final answer to the problem is ""The answer is 3.""","GPT Response: First, let's use the definition of the Prime Factor Counting operation (F) indicated by the # symbol.

1. Evaluate 8#2:
The prime factors of 8 (|8| since the operation only considers positive values) are 2, 2, and 2.
The prime factors of 2 (|2|) are just 2.
The common unique prime factors of both numbers are simply 2, so there's 1 common unique prime factor.

Therefore, 8#2 = 1.

2. Evaluate 6#6:
The prime factors of 6 (|6|) are 2 and 3.
Since we are comparing the number with itself (6#6), the common unique prime factors would be 2 and 3.
However, the statement of the operation says we are looking for unique prime factors, meaning each prime factor is counted only once regardless of its multiplicity in both numbers.

Therefore, 6#6 = 2

Now, we simply add the results from the prime factor counting operations as per the normal order of operations (PEFMDASC).

1 + 2 = 3

1. Calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) of 8#2: 

To get the unique shared prime factors of 8 and 2, we look at their prime factorizations.
- The prime factorization of 8 is 2^3 (which is 2, 2, and 2)
- The prime factorization of 2 is just 2
The shared unique prime factor here is 2, so there is exactly 1 shared prime factor.

Therefore, 8#2 equals 1.

2. Calculate the Prime Factor Counting (F) of 6#6:

To get the unique shared prime factors of 6 and 6:
- The prime factorization of 6 is 2 * 3
- For the same number (6), the prime factorization is still just 2 and 3
Here, there are 2 shared unique prime factors, which are 2 and 3.

Therefore, 6#6 equals 2.

3. Now, add the results (A):

From step 1, we have 8#2 = 1, and from step 2, we have 6#6 = 2. So we add these together:

6 # 6 evaluates the unique prime factors common to 6 and 6. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since we're looking at the same number, all prime factors are shared. However, we only count each prime factor once, so 6 # 6 = 2 (since 2 and 3 are both prime factors and are both unique).

Putting it all together:

8 # 2 + 6 # 6
= 1 + 2
= 3

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: To solve the expression \(8 \# 2 + 6 \# 6\) step by step according to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we do the following:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): First, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation, which comes after Parentheses (P) and Exponents (E) in our order.

\(8 \# 2\) counts the unique shared prime factors between 8 and 2. The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (since \(8 = 2 \times 2 \times 2\)) and the prime factors of 2 is just 2. They share a prime factor of 2. Since it's the same prime factor repeated, we still count it as 1 unique shared prime factor.

\(8 \# 2 = 1\)

Now, we look at \(6 \# 6\). The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 (since \(6 = 2 \times 3\)), and 6 compared to itself obviously has the same prime factors, so we have 2 shared prime factors.

\(6 \# 6 = 2\)

2. Addition (A): After evaluating the prime factor counting, we perform the addition. No Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, or Division operations are present to evaluate before this step.

\(1 + 2 = 3\)

Therefore, the expression evaluates to 3. The final answer is 3."

3. Prime Factor Counting (F):
   We need to find the count of unique prime factors common to 2 and 3:
   The prime factors of 2 are just 2 itself.

    - Calculate 8 # 2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or 2^3), and the prime factors of 2 are just 2. The shared prime factor is 2, so the result is 1 (since they share the prime factor 2 only once).
    - Calculate 6 # 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since both numbers are the same, they share all their prime factors. However, we just count the distinct prime factors once, so the result is 2 (they share both prime factors 2 and 3).

Therefore, the final answer to the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 is 3.

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Let's evaluate the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F) comes before addition (A), so we need to evaluate both 8 # 2 and 6 # 6 first.
2. 8 has prime factors of 2 (as 8 = 2^3), and 2 itself is prime.
   The number of unique prime factors shared by 8 and 2 is 1 (since both have the prime factor 2). Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1.
3. 6 has prime factors of 2 and 3 (as 6 = 2 * 3).
   The number of unique prime factors shared by 6 and 6 is 2 (since the prime factors are 2 and 3 for both numbers). Therefore, 6 # 6 = 2 (since there are two shared prime factors, 2 and 3).
4. So the expression now simplifies to 1 + 2.
5. The last operation is addition (A), so we add 1 and 2 together.

Calculating the final result:

1 + 2 = 3

Therefore, the answer is 3.","GPT Response: First, let's evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operations before we perform any addition (A), since the new order of operations is PEFMDASC.

For the first operation, 8 # 2:

8 = 2^3 (The prime factors of 8 are a threefold of 2)
2 = 2 (The only prime factor of 2 is 2)
The unique common prime factor between 8 and 2 is just one number, 2. So:
8 # 2 = 1

Now, for the second operation, 6 # 6:

6 = 2 * 3 (The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3)
6 = 2 * 3 (Same prime factors for this 6)
All the prime factors of the first 6 are common with the second 6, but we only count unique common factors once, so the answer is 2 (since both 2 and 3 are common and unique):

6 # 6 = 2

5. Concatenation (C).

Let's evaluate this expression step-by-step:

Expression: 6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3

Step 1: Solve the operation in parentheses.
= 6@18 + 12-2  #  3

Step 2: Solve the prime factor counting operation (#).

Therefore, The answer is 629.","GPT Response: Let's solve this expression step by step.

We need to use the updated PEFMDASC method which implies the following order: parentheses, exponents, prime factor counting, multiplication and division (left to right), addition and subtraction (left to right), and finally concatenation (left to right).

Starting with:

> 6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3

First, Parentheses (P)

> = 6@18 + 12-2#3

Next, do Factor Counting (F):

> = 6@18 + 12-1 (since prime factors of 2 are {2} and prime factors of 3 are {3}, they share no common prime factor, hence the factor counting 2#3 equals 0)

Then, Addition and Subtraction (A/S):

> = 6@18 + 11 (subtraction is before Addition)
> = 6@29  

Finally, perform Concatenation (C):

> = 629

The steps to solve the calculation are:
1. Perform the operation inside the parentheses (14+4 = 18).
2. Perform Prime factor counting 2#3 = 0 (There are no common prime factors between 2 and 3)
3. Subtract the resolved prime factor counting from 12 (12-0 = 12).
4. Add 12 and 18 (12+18 = 30).
5. Concatenate 6 and 29 (629).

Given problem is : 8#2 + 6#6

Step 1: Compute Prime Factor Counting (#)
Initially, we need to find the result for the Prime Factor Counting operation which is 8#2 and 6#6. 

The unique prime factors of 8 are 2 whereas unique prime factors of 2 are 2. Thus, they have one common unique prime factor. Hence, 8#2 equals 1.

Similarly, the unique prime factors of 6 are 2, and 3 and for 6 it is same 2,3. They share 2 unique common prime factors (2 and 3). Hence, 6#6 equals 2.

After this step, our expression becomes: 1 + 2

Step 2: Compute Addition
Now that we have only addition operation left, we need to add the results together. So 1 + 2 equals 3. 

So, the solution will be 3.

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: By applying the order of operations PEFMDASC:

(i) We need to execute the Prime Factor Counting (F) first. The prime factors of 8 are 2, and for 2, it's 2 as well. Therefore, 8#2 = 1.
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Therefore, 6#6 = 1.

The resultant expression would be: 1 + 1

(ii) Now, we can execute the addition (A) operation, so 1 + 1 = 2. 

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: First, remember that the updated order of operations is PEFMDASC, so we'll conduct the Prime Factor Counting operation first.

Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F) shared above point out that a common prime factor between two numbers has to be counted for operation F(a#b) which implies both a and b to possess the same prime number as a factor.

(i) 8 # 2:
The prime factor of 8 is 2, and the only prime factor of 2 is also 2.
So, 8#2 = 1 because 2 is the single shared prime factor.

Also,

(ii) 6 # 6:
6 has two prime factors: 2 and 3. Also, for another 6, the factors remain the same. Therefore, 6#6 = 2 because both are factors of 6.

Now substitute these results back into the original problem: 

8#2 + 6#6 now becomes 1 + 2. 

So, the answer is 3.","GPT Response: Given a mathematical expression 8#2 + 6#6.

The expression does not contain parentheses, exponents, or prime factor counting, so we start with addition and subtraction (A/S).

However, according to the updated order of operations, we need to perform concatenation (C) after the addition or subtraction, so we will first perform the addition before the concatenation.

Thus, we first add 5 + 2 which equals 7. Then we perform the concatenation with 4.

So the steps are:
1. 5 + 2 = 7
2. 7 @ 4 = 74 (concatenation of 7 and 4)

6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3

Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Parentheses (P)
First, calculate the expression inside the parentheses:
14 + 4 = 18

So the expression becomes:
6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Exponents (E)
There are no exponents in this expression.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we determine the prime factor counting for the terms 2 and 3.
The prime factors of 2 are {2}, and the prime factors of 3 are {3}.
There are no shared prime factors, so 2 # 3 = 0.

Now our expression is:
6@18 + 12 - 0

4. Multiplication and Division (M/D)
There are no multiplication or division operations left to perform.

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
We now perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
6@18 + 12 - 0
Since there's nothing to subtract (because our subtraction turned into -0), we'll just be adding 12 to the result of the concatenation operation:
= 6@18 + 12
= 618 + 12
= 630

6. Concatenation (C)
Finally, we perform the concatenation operation, which joins numbers at the digit level.

Since the addition should be complete before we reach the concatenation operation, the concatenation operation here is in fact already resolved in step 5 (6@18 = 618).

So, the expression has been simplified to 630, and there are no further operations to perform.

The answer is 630.","GPT Response: Let's solve the given problem step by step, using the revised order of operations PEFMDASC.

The original expression is:

14 + 4 = 18

Now our expression looks like this:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents to calculate in this expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we perform the prime factor counting operation:
2 # 3

The prime factors of 2 are just 2. The prime factors of 3 are just 3. Since they do not share any prime factors, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 0.
2 # 3 = 0

Our expression is now:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication/Division (M/D)
There is no multiplication or division to be carried out next.

Step 5: Addition/Subtraction (A/S)
Before we can do the concatenation, we need to perform the addition and subtraction operations that are available to us:

Adding 18 and 12:
18 + 12 = 30

The subtraction of 0 is trivial and doesn't change the value:
30 - 0 = 30

First, we solve any operations within parentheses:

14 + 4 = 18

2. Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we count the number of unique prime factors that are common between the absolute values of 2 and 3:

Prime factors of 3: 3
There are no shared prime factors, so:

5. Concatenation (C)
Finally, we apply the concatenation operation, which merges the digits:

6@18 = 618 (Concatenating 6 and 18)

Now, the expression becomes:
6@18 + 12-2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents
There are no exponents to evaluate.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting
We need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation between 2 and 3. The prime factors of 2 are just 2, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3. Since there are no common prime factors, 2 # 3 equals 0.

Next, we look for prime factor counting (F) before moving on to any other operations:
Since there is no concatenation or exponentiation before the prime factor counting, we can evaluate it next.

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents in the expression, so we skip this step.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
We concatenate 6 and 18: 6@18
Please note that concatenation is performed after addition or subtraction when they occur in the sequence without parentheses. Since the addition comes inside the parentheses, we concatenate first in this case.

8 # 2 + 6 # 6

First, we apply the prime factor counting operation (#) before we do the addition, according to the new order of operations PEFMDASC.

The prime factorization of 8 is 2^3 (contains the prime factor 2).
The prime factorization of 2 is just 2 (contains the prime factor 2).

Since 2 is the unique prime factor shared by 8 and 2, the result of the prime factor counting operation for these two numbers is:

8 # 2 = 1 (Because they share the prime factor 2 only).

The prime factorization of 6 is 2 * 3 (contains the prime factors 2 and 3).

6 # 6 compares the number to itself which has the shared prime factors 2 and 3. However, the operation counts the unique prime factors shared. In this case, both the shared prime factors are counted only once since they are unique.

6 # 6 = 2 (Because it has two unique prime factors: 2 and 3).

Now our expression becomes:

1 + 2

1 + 2 = 3

First, we attend to the Prime Factor Counting (F) before dealing with the addition (A):

- For 8#2:
The absolute values are used, |8| = 8 and |2| = 2. The prime factors of 8 are 2 * 2 * 2, and the prime factor of 2 is 2. Since both numbers share the prime factor of 2, there is 1 shared prime factor.
- Result: 8#2 = 1

- For 6#6:
Absolute values are |6| = 6 and |6| = 6. The unique prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since we're comparing a number with itself, all its prime factors will be shared.
- Result: 6#6 = 2 (since there are two unique prime factors here: 2 and 3)

Firstly, we will evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) as it comes right after Exponents (E) and before Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction (M/D and A/S):

8#2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2. The prime factors of 2 are just 2. They share the prime factor 2, so the result is 1.

6#6: The prime factor of 6 are 2 and 3. Since we are comparing the same number, it shares all of its prime factors with itself. However, we need to count the unique prime factors, which in this case are just 2 and 3, but since the operation counts the common factors, which are both present, the result is 2 (2 and 3).

Now, let's perform these operations:

8#2 = 1
6#6 = 2

So, 8#2 = 1.

- For the term 6#6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since both numbers are the same, the unique prime factors (2 and 3) are shared between both.

F: Prime Factor Counting
M/D: Multiplication and Division (left to right)
A/S: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
C: Concatenation (left to right)

Let's break down the calculation step by step:
1. Solve the expression within the parentheses first: (14 + 4)
2. Evaluate any prime factor counting (F)
3. Perform multiplication and division from left to right (if any)
4. Carry out addition and subtraction from left to right
5. Apply concatenation (C) from left to right

Now, let's apply these steps to the problem:

6@(14+4) + 12 - 2 # 3

First, solve the parentheses (PE):
6@(14+4) = 6@18
+ 12
- 2 # 3

Next, solve the prime factor counting (F):
2 # 3 = 0 (because the prime factors of 2 are {2} and the prime factors of 3 are {3}, no shared prime factors)
6@18
+ 12
- 0

Now let's operate the addition and subtraction (A/S):
6@18
+ 12

Finally, we perform the concatenation (C):
6@18 = 618 (since concatenation is just placing the digits side by side)
618 + 12 = 630

The answer is 630.","GPT Response: We will solve the expression 6@(14+4) + 12 - 2 # 3 using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC.

1. Parentheses (P):
   First, we evaluate the expression inside the parenthesis.
   \( 14 + 4 = 18 \)

   So the expression becomes:
   \( 6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3 \)

2. Prime Factor Counting (F):
   Next, we perform prime factor counting on 2 and 3.

   The prime factors of 2 are {2}, and the prime factors of 3 are {3}. They have no shared prime factors.
   \(2 # 3 = 0\)

   Now the expression is:
   \( 6@18 + 12 - 0 \)

3. Exponents (E):
   There are no exponents to evaluate in this expression.

4. Multiplication/Division (M/D):
   There are no multiplication or division operations to evaluate in this expression.

5. Addition/Subtraction (A/S):
   Perform the subtraction next, since addition and subtraction are of the same precedence and we go from left to right.
   \( 12 - 0 = 12 \)

   Now the expression is:
   \( 6@18 + 12 \)

6. Concatenation (C):
   Finally, we perform the concatenation of 6 with 18:
   \( 6@18 = 618 \)

   Now we add 12 to 618:
   \( 618 + 12 = 630 \)

So, step-by-step, we have:

\( 6@(14+4) + 12 - 2 # 3 \\
6@18 + 12 - 0 \( \( (Prime Factor Counting) \) \\
618 + 12 \( \( (Concatenation) \) \\

congruent,10,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve this mathematics problem according to the new rules, let's execute the operations step by step:

First, we must perform the Prime Factor Counting operation (F), as it comes before Addition (A) in the order of operations PEFMDASC.

So we start with:
**Prime Factor Counting (F)**
1. \(8#2\) – Prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2, and the prime factor for 2 is 2. They share the prime factor 2.
2. \(6#6\) – Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and for the other 6 it’s the same 2 and 3. They share two prime factors: 2 and 3.

Now we carry out the Prime Factor Counting operation:
\(8#2 = 1\) (since 2 is the only unique shared prime factor)
\(6#6 = 2\) (since both 2 and 3 are the shared prime factors)

**Addition (A)**
\(8#2 + 6#6 = 1 + 2 = 3\)

The final answer to this problem, therefore, is \(3\).
Thus, ""The answer is 3.""","GPT Response: To solve the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6, we need to follow the updated order of operations PEFMDASC.

First, let's find the shared unique prime factors for each Prime Factor Counting operation:

1. For 8 # 2:
- The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (which is 2^3).
- The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
- The unique shared prime factor is 2, and there is only one such shared prime factor.

So, 8 # 2 = 1

2. For 6 # 6:
- The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
- Since we're comparing the number with itself, the shared unique prime factors will be the same as the prime factors of 6.
- Since 6 has two unique prime factors (2 and 3), the count is 2.

So, 6 # 6 = 2

Now we combine these results following the order of operations, with Prime Factor Counting (F) first, then Addition (A):

8 # 2 + 6 # 6
= 1 + 2
= 3

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: First, according to the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we start by evaluating the Prime Factor Counting (F).

So, let's find the unique prime factors common to |8| and |2| and to |6| and |6|.

For 8#2:
8 has prime factors 2 (2 x 2 x 2), and
2 has the prime factor 2.

Since 2 is the only prime factor they have in common, 8#2 = 1.

For 6#6:
6 has prime factors 2 and 3 (2 x 3), and
6 has the same prime factors.

Since both prime factors are common, 6#6 = 2 because we are counting the unique prime factors.

Now we add the results of the prime factor counting:

1 (from 8#2) + 2 (from 6#6) = 3.

Therefore, the answer is 3.","GPT Response: To solve the problem 8#2 + 6#6 using the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we proceed as follows:

First, we count the unique prime factors for each pair, starting with 8#2:
- The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (since 8 = 2^3).
- The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
The shared prime factor between 8 and 2 is 2. Since it's shared, we count it once, so 8#2 = 1.

Next, we calculate 6#6:
- The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 (since 6 = 2 x 3).
- The prime factors of the other 6 are the same, 2 and 3.
There are two shared prime factors, 2 and 3, so 6#6 = 2.

2. Addition (A)

Step 1: Parentheses
In the expression, we have (14 + 4). Evaluating the parentheses first, we get:
(14 + 4) = 18

Step 2: Exponents
There are no exponents in the expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting
Next, we evaluate the prime factor counting. We have 2 # 3. Since 2 and 3 are both prime numbers and have no common prime factors, the result is 0.

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (left to right)
Since there are no multiplication or division operations, there is nothing to be solved in this step.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
Next, we need to perform addition and subtraction. 

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 6: Concatenation (left to right)
Now we evaluate concatenation. We have 6 @ 18. Concatenating 6 and 18, we get 618.

Inside the parentheses, we have 14 + 4 which equals 18. So, the expression becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Evaluate the concatenation operation (@) from left to right.
Since the left operand is 6 and the right operand is 18, we concatenate them to get 618.
So, the expression becomes:
618 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 3: Evaluate the prime factor counting operation (#) from left to right.
Since the left operand is 2 and the right operand is 3, they don't have any shared prime factors. So, the result is 0.
So, the expression becomes:
618 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Evaluate addition and subtraction operations from left to right.
6, 18, and 12 are added together to get 36. Then, subtract 0 from 36.
