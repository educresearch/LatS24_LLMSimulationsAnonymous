Firstly, Prime Factor Counting operation (F) comes before Addition (A) in the new order of operations. Therefore, we need to perform the prime factor counting before we can do the addition.

8 # 2 = 1 (since the prime factors of 8 are 2, and the prime factors of 2 is 2 also. There is 1 shared prime factor, 2)

6 # 6 = 1 (since the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 while 6 has the same prime factors, 2 and 3. Therefore there is 1 shared prime factor, 2)

We then replace the prime factor counting operations in the original question with their results.

So the original problem 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 becomes 1 + 1.

Next, we perform the addition operation, 1 + 1 = 2

Therefore, the answer to the problem is 2.

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

systemPrompt3_userPrompt2_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Let's decompose for the given problem.

Firstly, Prime Factor Counting operation (F) comes before the addition operation (A). This means we have to evaluate 8 # 2 and 6 # 6 first.

Prime factors of 8 are 2.
Prime factors of 2 are 2.
Thus, 8 # 2 = 1 (since the shared prime factor is 2).

On the other hand, prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
Since 6 # 6 is counting the shared prime factors of the same number, all the prime factors are shared.
Thus, 6 # 6 = 2 (since the shared prime factors are 2 and 3).

Now we can substitute these values back to the original problem.
This becomes 1 + 2.

Finally, we evaluate the addition to find the result which is 3.

The answer is 3."

Given:

4 # 3 + 2

Steps:
(i) Evaluate 4 # 3: This operation counts the unique prime factors common to |a| and |b|. The prime factors of 4 are [2] and the prime factors of 3 are [3]. Thus, they do not share any common prime factors. Therefore, 4 # 3 = 0

The operation is 5 + 3 # 2. 

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting
Prime factors of 3 are [3] and prime factors of 2 are [2]. Therefore, there are no shared prime factors between them. So, 3 # 2 = 0.

The expression now changes to: 5 + 0.

Step 2: Addition
5 + 0 = 5.

The answer is 5."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

Step 1: Evaluate Parentheses
= 6 @ (18) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: There are no exponents

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1
Here, prime factors of 2 are 2, and prime factors of 3 are 3. Therefore, no common prime factors are shared, hence the count is 0.

Step 4: There are no multiplication or division operations

Step 5: Evaluate Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
= 6 @ 18 + 11
= 6 @ 29

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
= 629

So, 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 = 629

The answer is 629."

Let's start with the prime factor counting operation:

3 # 2

The prime factors of 3 are just 3 itself. The prime factors of 2 are just 2 itself. They have no shared prime factors. 

So, 3 # 2 = 0.

Now we perform the addition:
