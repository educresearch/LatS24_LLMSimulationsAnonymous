gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression 5 + 2 @ 4, we need to follow the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC).

First, there are no parentheses, exponents, or prime factor counting involved in this expression.

So, we move on to addition and subtraction. We have 5 + 2, which equals 7.

Next, we have concatenation to perform. The concatenation operation @ joins the numbers at a digit level. So, we concatenate 7 and 4 to get 74.

Therefore, the answer is 74."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is now expanded to PEFMDASC:

1. Prime Factor counting (F)
2. Addition and Subtraction (A and S)

Let's start with the Prime Factor counting operation:

8 # 2 = 1 (since the prime factors of 8 are 2 and the prime factors of 2 are 2, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)

Now, we apply addition:

1 + 6 # 6

Next, let's do the Prime Factor counting again:

6 # 6 = 1 (since 6 shares only 1 factor, which is 2)

Now, we apply addition:

1 + 1 = 2

The final answer is 2.

   - So, the expression becomes 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 - 1.

3. Concatenation:
   - 6 @ 18 equals 618.
   - So, the expression becomes 618 + 12 - 2 - 1.

4. Addition and Subtraction:
   - Performing addition and then subtraction, we have:
     618 + 12 - 2 - 1 = 630 - 2 - 1 = 628 - 1 = 627.

Therefore, the final answer is ""The answer is 627."""
