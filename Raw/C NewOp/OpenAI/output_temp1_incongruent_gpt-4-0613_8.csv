So the step will be: 
6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3 

Next, we proceed from the left to the right for remaining operations. 

First we come across Concatenation, according to the new order, 

= 618 + 12 - 2#3 

Next, we encounter addition,

= 630 - 2#3 

Finally, we encounter Prime Factor counting at the end, 

2 and 3 both have 2 as the only prime factor, resulting 1 overall:
= 630 - 1 

So, the final answer is 629.

""Hence, The answer is 629."""
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

Step 1: In the order of operation, parenthesis comes first, so we solve for (14 + 4):
6 @ (18) + 12 - 2#3

Step 2: Next comes prime factor counting (F): solving for 2#3,
Prime factors of 2 are [2] and prime factors of 3 are [3], so shared factors are 0.
The expression becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3: Then we perform concatenation (C) for 6 @ 18:
618 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Next comes addition (A): doing the operation 618 + 12:
630 - 0

First, we have to handle the Prime Factor Counting (F), which is the operation ""#"". Prime factors of 8 are 2, and prime factors of 2 are 2. Since they share a common factor of 2, 8 # 2 = 1. 

Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Again prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Therefore, they share two common factors of 2 and 3, 6 # 6 = 2.

As the only operations left are addition, we can now solve: 
1 + 2 = 3

So, the answer to the mathematical problem 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 3

The answer is 3."

The prime factors of 3 are 3 only, and the prime factors of 2 are 2 only. So there are no common prime factors between 3 and 2, so

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

Step 1 - Parentheses (P): Solve the expression within parentheses first.
6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 2 - Prime Factor counting (F): Determine the number of prime factors shared between 2 and 3.
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 (since there are no common prime factors between 2 and 3)

Step 3 - Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Perform addition and subtraction from left to right.
= 6 @ 18 + 12
= 6 @ 30

Step 4 - Concatenation (C): Concatenate 6 and 30.

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

Step 1: Parentheses. There are no parentheses in this expression, so we can move to the next step.

Step 2: Exponents. There are no exponents in this expression, so we can move to the next step.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F). We have 3 # 2 in our equation. Let's evaluate that. 
    The prime factor for 3 is 3 and prime factor for 2 is 2. So, there are no common prime factors between 3 and 2. Therefore, 3 # 2 = 0.

So now our expression is 5+0.

Step 4: Multiplication and Division. There are no multiplication or divisions in this expression, so we can move on to the next step.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction. We have the addition operator in our expression. Let's do that next.
    5 + 0 = 5

Step 6: Concatenation. There are no concatenation operations in this expression, so we end here.

The answer is 5."
