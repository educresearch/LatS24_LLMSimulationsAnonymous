gpt-4-0613,1,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: Let's apply the rules step-by-step:

Initial expression: 5 + 3 # 2 

First, we need to perform the Prime Factor Counting operation because, according to the new PEFMDASC convention, it takes precedence over Addition.

The prime factors of |3| are set to {3}, and the prime factors of |2| are {2}. Since they don't share any common prime factors, the result of 3 # 2 is 0.

So the expression becomes : 5 + 0

Now we proceed with the Addition operation, so 5 + 0 equals 5.

Final Result: 5

So, ""The answer is 5.""","GPT Response: This problem includes the operations of addition and prime factor counting. As per the updated order of operations, PEFMDASC, we need to evaluate prime factor counting first.

So, the given problem becomes:

5+1

This is an addition problem that equals to 6.

So, the answer to the mathematical problem 5+3 # 2 is 6.

Hence, the answer is 6.","GPT Response: The problem is 5 + 3 # 2.

Going by the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation comes before the Addition (A) operation. Hence we should calculate 3 # 2 first.

The prime factor of 3 is 3, and the prime factor of 2 is 2. Hence, 3 # 2 is 0 as there is no shared prime factor between 3 and 2.

Now we proceed to do the addition operation, adding 5 to the result of 3 # 2.

So, 5 + 3 # 2 = 5 + 0 = 5.

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: Let's break it down using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F):

We have 3 # 2. The prime factors of 3 are only 3, and the prime factors of 2 is only 2. So these two numbers do not share any prime factor. Therefore, 3 # 2 = 0.

gpt-4-0613,1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: To solve the problem, we must follow the new order of operations, PEFMDASC. 

Firstly, apply parenthesis:
6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3 
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3 

Next, continue with Prime Factor counting (F): 
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3 
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (since the prime factor of 3 and 2 is 2, so they share 1 unique prime factor, 2) 

Then move to Addition (A) and Subtraction (S): 
6 @ 18 + 11
= 6 @ 29  

Lastly, Concatenation (C):  
6 @ 29 
= 629 

So, The answer is 629.","GPT Response: Let's break it down following the order of operations:

Firstly, we begin with parentheses operation:
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2#3 
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3 (deciding the operation in parentheses first).

Next, we go to prime factor counting:
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 
(2 and 3 share one common factor that is 2).

Next, we go to addition and subtraction (left to right):

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
6. Concatenation (C) 

So, let's walk through it step by step:

1. Parentheses (P):

   First, evaluate within the parentheses.

   => 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
   => 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

2. Prime Factor Counting (F):

   Next, evaluate the prime factor count.

   In this case, we are counting the number of unique prime factors common to 2 and 3. Since 2 and 3 are both primes themselves and they are unique, the factor count is 0.

   => 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

3. Addition and Subtraction (A/S):

   Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.

   => 6 @ 18 + 12
   => 6 @ 30
   => 6@30

4. Concatenation (C):

   Now, use the concatenation operation, merging the digits of 6 and 30.

   => 630

So, the answer to the problem 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3 using the updated order of operations is 630.

Final Answer: The answer is 630.","GPT Response: We solve this problem following the PEFMDASC order of operations, step by step:

Step 1: Evaluate Parentheses (P)
The expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3.

Step 2: Evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F)
The shared prime factor between 2 and 3 is none. So, 2#3 = 0.
Then, the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0.

Step 3: Evaluate Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
We perform addition between 18 and 12 which becomes 30. Then subtract 0 from 30 which is still 30.
Thus, the expression becomes: 6 @ 30.

Step 4: Evaluate Concatenation (C)
Concatenate 6 and 30, which becomes 630.

So, the answer is 3.","GPT Response: Before providing the answer, let's first break down the given problem. Based on the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

1) We have two operations in this problem: Prime Factor Counting (F) and Addition (A)
2) We calculate Prime Factor Countings first using the order of operations.

Let's compute the problem:

1) The unique prime factors of 8 are 2, since it's 2^3. 
2) The unique prime factors of 2 are 2, since it's the only prime factor.
So, 8 # 2 gives us 1 as there is 1 common prime factor.

3) The unique prime factor of 6 is 2 and 3, 
and since we are looking at 6 # 6, it's the same number, so it has the same prime factors. It gives us 2 as there are two prime factors.

Now, the new equation looks like: 1 + 2.

4) We calculate the addition, which gives 3.

Therefore, The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Given: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Step 1: We calculate Prime Factor Countings first using the PEFMDASC order:
8 # 2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, and the prime factors of 2 is 2. Hence these numbers share one prime factor, which is 2.

6 # 6: Both numbers are the same, thereby they share the same prime factors. Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, so the count comes out to 2.  

Thus 8 # 2 = 1 and 6 # 6 = 2

Step 2: Replace these values in the expression, we get:
