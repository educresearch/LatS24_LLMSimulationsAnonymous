systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-1106_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

1. First, we calculate the prime factor count for each pair of numbers.
2. Then, we perform addition from left to right.

Let's calculate the prime factor count:
8 # 2 = 1 (Since 8 has prime factors 2 and 2, and 2 has prime factor 2, there is one shared prime factor)
6 # 6 = 2 (Since both 6 have prime factors 2 and 3, they share two prime factors)

Now, we perform addition:
1 + 2 = 3

Therefore, the final answer is 3.

First, we identify that there are no parentheses or exponents in the expression.

Next, we evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation. The prime factorization of 3 is 3, and the prime factorization of 2 is 2. Since there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, the prime factor counting operation results in 0.

So, the expression becomes: 5 + 0

Finally, we perform addition (A/S) from left to right. 
5 + 0 equals 5.

Therefore, the final answer is ""The answer is 5."""

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):

                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)

Step 1: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses.
6 @(14+4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 (since we need to evaluate addition before concatenation)
= 618 + 12 - 2 # 3 (using the concatenation operation)

Step 2: Evaluate the prime factor count (F).
= 618 + 12 - 2 # 3
= 618 + 12 - 0 (since there are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3)

Step 3: Perform the concatenation operation (C).
= 618 + 12 - 0
= 61812 - 0

Step 4: Perform addition.
= 61812 - 0
= 61812 (since there's no need to perform addition when there's no other operation left)

So, the answer is 61812."
