gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To find the answer, we need to follow the updated order of operations: PEFMDASC.

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in the expression.

2. Exponents: There are no exponents in the expression.

3. Prime factor counting: We need to evaluate the prime factor counting operation before addition. The prime factors of 4 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so the result of 4 # 3 is 0.

4. Multiplication and Division (L to R): There are no multiplication or division operations in the expression.

5. Addition and Subtraction (L to R): We perform the addition operation next. 0 + 2 = 2.

6. Concatenation (L to R): There are no concatenation operations in the expression.

Therefore, the final answer is 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations: PEFMDASC.

First, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation:
4 # 3 = 1
Since the absolute values of 4 and 3 have only one shared prime factor, which is 2.

Next, we perform the addition operation:
1 + 2 = 3

The final answer is 3.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the updated order of operations: PEFMDASC.

First, we have a prime factor counting (F) operation between 4 and 3. The prime factors of 4 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since there are no shared prime factors, the result of 4 # 3 is 0.

Next, we have an addition operation (A) between the result of the prime factor counting (0) and 2. 0 + 2 is equal to 2.

Therefore, the final answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the PEFMDASC order, we will follow these steps:

Step 1: Evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation.
   The prime factors of 4 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are also 2 (since 3 is a prime number).
   Since both numbers have a common prime factor of 2, the result of 4 # 3 is 1.

Step 2: Perform the addition (A) operation.
   Now that we have the result of prime factor counting, we can add 1 to 2.
   1 + 2 equals 3.

Next, we have a concatenation operation. We merge the digits of 7 and 4. Since both numbers are positive, we simply merge them without taking the absolute values:

7 @ 4 = 74

Therefore, the answer is 74.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 2 @ 4 using the new operations and revised order of operations (PEFMDASC), let's break it down step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the prime factor count between 2 and 4 using the prime factor counting operation (#).
   - The prime factors of 2 are 2 (since 2 is a prime number).
   - The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
   - Since there is one shared prime factor (2), the prime factor count is 1.

Step 2: Perform the concatenation operation (@) between 2 (from the previous step) and 4.
   - The concatenation of 2 and 4 is 24.

Step 3: Add 5 to the result from Step 2.
