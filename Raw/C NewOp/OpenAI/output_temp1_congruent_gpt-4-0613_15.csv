Next, we need to handle the concatenation operation:

Following the order of operations, next we handle the addition and subtraction:

= 630 - 2  #  3
= 628  # 3

Finally, we perform the prime factor counting operation:

Prime factors of 628 are 2 and 157, and the prime factor of 3 is 3. So, there is no shared prime factor. Hence,

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

Going by the rules of PEFMDASC, '#' stands for Prime Factor counting and is to be evaluated before '+' which stands for Addition.

The prime factors of |3| are set to {3}, and the prime factors of |2| are {2}. Since they don't share any common prime factors, the result of 3 # 2 is 0.

Replace 3 # 2 with 0:

Next, for 6#6, the prime factors common to 6 itself are 2 and 3. Thus, it has 2 unique prime factors. 

So the operation now stands as follows: 

1 + 2 

Finally, we add these numbers together to get our final answer:

1 + 2 = 3 

Therefore,

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
The operation in parentheses is 14+4, which results in 18. 

So, our first step makes our equation look like this: 

6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no operations involving exponents in this equation, so we don't need to do anything here.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Here, we need to count unique prime factors common to 2 and 3. But there are none, so 2 # 3 = 0. 

Here's how our equation looks like now: 

6@18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
There are no multiplication or division operations here.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
We first perform the subtraction operation: 12 - 0, which results in 12.

After that, we perform the addition operation: 12 + 6@18

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
Here, we do the concatenation: 6@18 = 618

So, after performing the concatenation, the operation looks like this:

12 + 618

Once we perform the addition operation, we arrive at our final answer which is 630.

When using the order of operations PEFMDASC, it's clear to see that prime factor counting (F) should be evaluated before addition (A). To do so, we will count the unique common prime factors between |3| and |2|.

The unique prime factors of 3 are only 3, while those of 2 are only 2. Therefore, the count of unique common primes between 3 and 2 is zero.

We then substitute the value of 3#2 into the problem:

5 + 3#2 -> 5 + 0

Finish by calculating the sum.

5 + 0 = 5

Therefore, the answer is 5."

We first need to apply the new operation - 'Prime Factor Counting', as per the new order of operations PEFMDASC.
So, we calculate 8 # 2 and 6 # 6.

Prime factors of 8 are 2, and prime factors of 2 are 2, so they share 1 unique prime factor.
Thus, 8 # 2 = 1.

Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since 6 is repeated, we only consider its prime factors once. So, they share 2 unique prime factors.
Thus, 6 # 6 = 2.

The new expression becomes:

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Let's solve this step by step using the order PEFMDASC:

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
We will first tackle the term inside the parentheses:
14 + 4 = 18

Then the expression becomes:
6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
The second operation to be evaluated is Prime Factor Counting, denoted by the '#'. But it doesn't present before the other operations in this expression. So, we move on to the next operation in the order.

Step 3: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
Again, there are not any multiplication or division operations in the current state of this expression, so we move on to the next step in the order.

Step 4: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Addition operation is found in this step. The resulting calculation is:
6@18 + 12 = 6@30

Then the expression becomes:
6@30 - 2#3 

Step 5: Concatenation (C)
Next, we evaluate the concatenation operation, denoted by the '@'. The result of the operation is:
6@30 = 630

Then the expression becomes:
630 - 2#3 

Now, as per the order, we go back to Prime Factor Counting (F) step

Step 6: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we evaluate the prime counting operation. The prime factors of 2 and 3 are 2 and 3 respectively, which are not the same, so 2#3 equals 0.

Then the expression becomes:
630 - 0 

Step 7: Subtraction
Lastly, we perform the subtraction operation:
630 - 0 = 630
   
The answer is 630."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)

According to PEFMDASC, Prime factor counting comes before addition. So we evaluate 3#2 first. 

Step 1: Evaluate 3#2 (count of unique prime factors shared by 3 and 2)

The prime factor of 3 is 3, and the prime factor of 2 is 2, so they have no shared prime factors. Therefore, 3#2 = 0.

Now, the expression becomes 5 + 0.

Step 2: Perform 5 + 0

This is straightforward, 5 + 0 = 5.

So, the final expression evaluated is 5.

The answer is 5."
