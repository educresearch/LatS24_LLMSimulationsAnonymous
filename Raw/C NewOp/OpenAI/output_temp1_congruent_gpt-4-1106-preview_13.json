Parentheses (P)\n2. Exponents (E)\n3. Prime Factor Counting (F)\n4. Multiplication/Division (M/D)\n5. Addition/Subtraction (A/S)\n6. Concatenation (C)\n\nThe given expression is 5 + 3 # 2. Our first operational step, based on the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), is Prime Factor Counting (F).\n\nStep 1: Perform Prime Factor Counting (3 # 2)\nThe prime factors of 3 are 3 since it is a prime number. \nThe prime factors of 2 are 2 since it is a prime number.\nThere are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2.\nTherefore, 3 # 2 = 0.\n\nStep 2: Addition (5 + 0)\nNow we move on to the addition of 5 and the result from step 1, which is 0.\nSo we have: 5 + 0 = 5\n\nThe answer is 5."}]}]
