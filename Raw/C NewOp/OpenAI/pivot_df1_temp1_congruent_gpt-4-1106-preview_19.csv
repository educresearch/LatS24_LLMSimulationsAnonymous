First, we handle the addition:
5 + 2 = 7

Next, we perform the concatenation with the resulting sum and 4:
7 @ 4 = 74 (since the concatenation operation joins the numbers at a digit level)

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), you perform the operations in the following order:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
4. Multiplication (M) and Division (D) (from left to right)
5. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S) (from left to right)
6. Concatenation (C) (from left to right)

The problem given is: 8#2 + 6#6

Following the order:

- First, we do the prime factor counting (F) operation:

The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or 2^3). The prime factor of 2 is 2. Therefore, the prime factor they share is just 2. So, 8#2 equals to counting the number of unique prime factors shared by 8 and 2, which is just one (the prime factor 2).

For 6#6, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since the numbers are the same, the count of unique prime factors they share includes both of these primes. Thus, 6#6 equals to counting the number of unique prime factors shared by 6 and 6, which is two, the prime factors 2 and 3.

So, we have: 8#2 = 1 and 6#6 = 2.

- Then, we perform addition (A):

1 + 2 = 3

So, the final answer is: 3.

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: Let's apply the expanded order of operations PEFMDASC to solve the given problem.

Problem: 4 # 3 + 2

1. First, we handle prime factor counting (F), which comes before addition (A) in the order of operations.
   We need to find how many unique prime factors 4 and 3 share.

   The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (4 = 2^2).
   The prime factors of 3 are just 3 (3 = 3^1).

   Since 4 and 3 don't share any prime factors, the count is 0.

   Therefore, 4 # 3 = 0.

2. Now we handle the addition (A).
   We add the result from the previous step to 2:
   
   0 + 2 = 2.

6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3

First, handle the parentheses (P):
6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3
6@18 + 12-2 # 3

Next, handle the Prime Factor counting (F):
- Since we need to evaluate the # before we can do subtraction, let's find the shared prime factors of 2 and 3.
- The prime factors of 2 are {2}, and the prime factors of 3 are {3}. They do not share any prime factors.
6@18 + 12-0

Now, evaluate the Concatenation (C):
- Concatenate 6 and 18:
6 @ 18 = 618
618 + 12-0

Finally, handle addition/subtraction (A/S) (from left to right):
618 + 12 - 0 = 630 - 0 = 630

5 + 3 # 2

According to the order of operations, we need to perform the prime factor counting (F) before addition (A), so we first find the common unique prime factors between 3 and 2.

3 is a prime number, and its only prime factor is 3 itself.
2 is a prime number, and its only prime factor is 2 itself.

Since there are no common prime factors between 3 and 2, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 0.

So, the expression becomes:

5 + 0

Now we perform the addition:

5 + 0 = 5

The final answer is 5."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 5 + 2 @ 4, we need to follow the order of operations PEFMDASC.

1. Parentheses

3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D) from left to right
5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S) from left to right
6. Concatenation (C) from left to right

There are no parentheses, exponents, or prime factor counting to perform in this expression. There is also no multiplication or division. Therefore, we move directly to the next operations, which are addition and subtraction. However, according to the rule, concatenation (C) must be performed last, after addition and subtraction.

So for the expression 5 + 2 @ 4, we must first add 5 and 2, and then perform the concatenation operation with 4. Therefore:

5 + 2 = 7

Now we have:

7 @ 4

Now we perform concatenation:

7 @ 4 = 74

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we apply the order of operations PEFMDASC. Since there are no parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, or concatenation explicitly stated in the given problem and the only operations are Prime Factor Counting and Addition, we proceed in the given order:

First we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F):

1. 8#2: Prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (2^3). Prime factors of 2 are just 2.
Since they share the prime factor 2, the count of unique shared prime factors is 1.

2. 6#6: Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since both numbers are the same, they share the same prime factors: 2 and 3.
So, the count of unique shared prime factors is 2.

Now we add the results of the prime factor counting operations:

8#2 + 6#6

- \( 4 \# 3 \): The number 4 has prime factors of 2 (since \( 4 = 2^2 \)), and the number 3 has a prime factor of 3. There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so \( 4 \# 3 = 0 \).
- Now we have \( 0 + 2 \).
- Evaluating the addition, we get \( 0 + 2 = 2 \).

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, let's follow the revised order of operations PEFMDASC:

Given expression: 6@(14+4) + 12 - 2 # 3

1. Parentheses (P): Calculate the expression within the parentheses first:
   \( 14 + 4 = 18 \)

   The expression simplifies to:
   \( 6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3 \)

2. Prime Factor Counting (F): Calculate the prime factor counting next:
   \( 2 # 3 \)

   Since 2 has 2 as its prime factor and 3 has 3 as its prime factor, they do not share any prime factor:
   \( 2 # 3 = 0 \)

   The expression simplifies to:
   \( 6@18 + 12 - 0 \)

3. Addition/Subtraction (A/S): With prime factor counting completed, we proceed with addition and subtraction from left to right:
   \( 12 - 0 = 12 \)

   The expression simplifies to:
   \( 6@18 + 12 \)

4. Concatenation (C): Finally, perform the concatenation, which is now just left to right:
   \( 6@18 \)
   
   Concatenating \( 6 \) and \( 18 \) yields \( 618 \).

   So now we are left with:
   \( 618 + 12 \)

   Adding \( 618 \) and \( 12 \) gives us:

Prime Factor Counting (F):

3 # 2 means we count the number of unique prime factors shared by 3 and 2.

The prime factorization of 3 is 3 itself, and the prime factorization of 2 is 2 itself. Since they do not share any prime factors, the result of 3 # 2 is 0.

1. Address Prime Factor Counting (F) first for both \(8#2\) and \(6#6\).

The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or \(2^3\)).
The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
The shared prime factor is just 2, so \(8#2 = 1\).

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
The prime factors of 6 (again) are 2 and 3.
All the prime factors are shared, but we're looking for unique prime factors only, which are 2 and 3, so \(6#6 = 2\).

2. Next, addition (A) as per the order of operations:

Prime factor counting comes before addition, so we first calculate 4 # 3:

The prime factor of 4 is 2 (4 = 2^2).
The prime factors of 3 is 3 (3 = 3).
Since there is no common prime factor between 4 and 3, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 0:

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S) left to right
6. Concatenation (C) left to right

The given problem is 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3. We start by solving the expression inside the parentheses:

14 + 4 = 18

So now we have:

6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Now we apply Prime Factor Counting:

The prime factors of 2 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are just 3. Since there are no common prime factors, 2 # 3 equals 0:

6@18 + 12 - 0

Since there is no multiplication or division to do, we move on to addition and subtraction:

12 - 0 = 12

Now we're left with:

6@18 + 12

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 8#2 + 6#6, we must follow the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F)
2. Addition (A)

Let's break it down:

1. We first address the Prime Factor Counting between 8 and 2.
   - The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or 2^3).
   - The prime factors of 2 are just 2.

Since 2 is a common prime factor, there is 1 unique shared prime factor. So, 8#2 evaluates to 1.

2. Next, we perform Prime Factor Counting between 6 and 6.
   - The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
   - Since we are comparing the same number, 6#6 should technically account for the same prime factors (2 and 3).

However, since we are looking for the count of ""unique"" prime factors shared between the two, and it is the same number (hence they share all the prime factors), we only count each prime factor once. So, 6#6 is 2, rather than 4, which would have been the case if we counted each appearance of a shared prime factor.

3. Now we have the simplified expression, which looks like this: 1 + 2.

4. Finally, we perform the addition.
   - 1 + 2 equals 3.

1. Parentheses (P): First, we calculate the expression inside the parentheses.
   
   \(14 + 4 = 18\)

So the expression now becomes:

\(6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3\)

2. Exponents (E): There are no exponents to calculate in this expression.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F): Next, we perform the prime factor counting operation, which comes before multiplication/division and addition/subtraction.

   \(2 # 3\)

Since 2 and 3 are both prime and are different, there are no shared prime factors. Thus this operation yields:
   
   \(2 # 3 = 0\)

Now the expression is simplified to:

\(6 @ 18 + 12 - 0\)

4. Division (D) and Multiplication (M): There are no division or multiplication to calculate in this expression.

5. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S): We perform the addition and subtraction from left to right. However, we still need to perform the concatenation before these operations.

Now, we proceed with the concatenation (C), which is the last operation in our list:

\(6 @ 18\)

To concatenate, we join the digits of 6 and 18 together:

\(6 @ 18 = 618\)

Now, we proceed with the remaining addition and subtraction:

\(618 + 12 - 0\)

First, add 618 and 12:

\(618 + 12 = 630\)

Then subtract 0, which doesn't change the value:

\(630 - 0 = 630\)

6. Concatenation (C): We've already handled concatenation.
