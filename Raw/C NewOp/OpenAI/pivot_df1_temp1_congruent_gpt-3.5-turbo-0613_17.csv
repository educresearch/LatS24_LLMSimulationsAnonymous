Step 1: Evaluate what is inside the parentheses (P).
Inside the parentheses, we have 14 + 4. 
So, 14 + 4 equals 18.

Now, the expression becomes: 6@(18) + 12-2  #  3

Step 2: Evaluate the concatenation operation (@) from left to right (C).
Here, we have 6 @ 18.

Now, the expression becomes: 628  #  3

Step 4: Evaluate the prime factor counting operation (#).
Here, we have 628  #  3.
The prime factors of 628 are 2 and 157, and the prime factors of 3 are only 3.
