gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: Let's break down the problem using the new order of operations PEFMDASC:

We have the mathematical expression: 8#2 + 6#6

1. First, we handle the Prime Factor Counting operation (#):
   - 8 has prime factors 2 since 8 = 2^3.
   - 2 is a prime number, so its only prime factor is itself, 2.
   - Thus, 8 and 2 share the prime factor 2, which means 8#2 equals 1 because there's one unique shared prime factor.
   
   - 6 has prime factors 2 and 3 since 6 = 2 * 3.
   - Therefore, 6 shares its own prime factors, which means 6#6 equals 2 because it has two unique prime factors.

2. Now, we add the results of the Prime Factor Counting:
   - The expression now reads: 1 + 2

3. We perform the addition:
   - 1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3."

The given expression is 6@(14+4) + 12 - 2 # 3.

Let's solve it step by step:

1. Parentheses: We first solve the expression inside the parentheses.
   14 + 4 = 18 
   Now, our expression is 6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3.

2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this expression, so we move on to the next operation.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F): The next step is to solve the prime factor counting operation.
   Since 2 and 3 share a common prime factor (which is 3), 2 # 3 equals 1.
   Now, our expression is 6@18 + 12 - 1.

4. Multiplication (M) and Division (D): There are no multiplication or division operations to perform, so we go to the next step.

5. Addition (A) and Subtraction (S): Before moving on to concatenation, we must perform addition and subtraction from left to right.
   12 - 1 = 11
   Now our expression is 6@18 + 11.

First, we should do the Prime Factor Counting (F) followed by Addition (A):

- Prime Factor Counting (F):
  - For 8#2, 8 has the prime factors of 2 (since 8 = 2^3) and 2 is itself a prime number. The only shared prime factor is 2. Hence, 8#2 yields 1.
  - For 6#6, 6 has the prime factors of 2 and 3 (since 6 = 2 * 3). Given that they are the same number, the shared prime factors are 2 and 3. However, we count unique prime factors, so we have 2 unique factors. Hence, 6#6 yields 2.

Now we proceed to Addition (A):
- 1 (from 8#2) + 2 (from 6#6) = 3

Our final answer is therefore:

(14 + 4) = 18

Now our expression looks like this: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents to calculate in this expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Calculate the prime factor counting operation.

3. **F**actor Counting (Prime Factor Counting): Evaluate 8#2 and 6#6.
   - 8 has prime factors of 2 (2 * 2 * 2).

Given expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
First, we evaluate the expression within the parentheses:
14 + 4 = 18

So our expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, we evaluate the prime factor counting operation:
2 and 3 have a common prime factor which is 3, so 2 # 3 = 1 because there is 1 common prime factor.

Now the expression is: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

Step 3: Concatenation (C)
Now we perform the concatenation operation. Remember that we treat concatenation as if we are appending strings (or digits in this case):
6 @ 18 becomes 618

So the expression is now: 618 + 12 - 1

Steps 4/5: Multiplication/Division (M/D) and Addition/Subtraction (A/S)
There are no multiplication or division operations left, so we proceed to addition and subtraction, which we perform from left to right:

3. **F** - Prime Factor Counting: Evaluate the prime factor counting operation first.
4. **M/D** Multiplication and Division: Not applicable here.

Let's now apply these steps to the expression:

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (\#)
- For the term \(8\#2\), the prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (as \(2^3 = 8\)), and the prime factor of 2 is itself, thus they share one unique prime factor: 2.
- For the term \(6\#6\), the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since it’s the same number, it shares all unique prime factors with itself. So, the shared unique prime factors are 2 and 3.

Therefore, \(8\#2\) gives us 1, and \(6\#6\) gives us 2 (since 2 and 3 are two different prime factors).

The expression now looks like this:
\(1 + 2\)
