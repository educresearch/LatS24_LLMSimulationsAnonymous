So, 5 + 2 should be performed first. The primary arithmetic operation here, i.e., addition, will happen first. 

That gives 7 @ 4 next.

Now, we perform the concatenation operation, joining 7 and 4.

14 + 4 = 18.

Now the equation is:

6@18 + 12-2  #  3.

Next, in accordance with the PEFMDASC order, we need to perform concatenation:

6@18 = 618.

So now, the equation becomes:

618 + 12-2  #  3.

Then the subtraction is done:

618 + 10 # 3.

Then, we perform Prime Factor counting. Here the prime factors of 10 are 2 and 5, and that of 3 is just 3. Since they do not have any common prime factors,

10 # 3 = 0.

So, the equation becomes:

618 + 0.

The sum then is 618.

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

Prime factors of 8 are 2 itself, repeated three times (since 2*2*2=8). Similarly, prime factors of 2 are only 2. Therefore, the shared prime factor between them would be just 2.
So, 8#2 = 1

Now, considering 6#6, since the values are the same, all the prime factors of 6, which are 2 and 3, would be the shared prime factors. But the count of unique prime numbers is what matters, so 6#6 = 2.

Our given problem is 4 # 3 + 2. Here, according to the order F comes before A (addition). So, we have to evaluate prime factor counting first.

Prime factors of 4 are 2.
Prime factors of 3 are 3.
Therefore, 4 # 3 equals 0 (since there are no common prime factors).

So our problem now becomes 0 + 2. Solving this, we get:

0 + 2 = 2.

systemPrompt3_userPrompt2_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To understand the solution to the given problem, 8#2 + 6#6, we begin by following the newly updated order of operations, PEFMDASC.

In the expression, there are no Parentheses (P), Exponents (E), Multiplication or Division (M/D), Addition or Subtraction (A/S), or Concatenation operations (C), so we focus on F, the Prime Factor Counting operation.

The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2 and 2. The prime factor of 2 is 2. 

So 8#2 = 1 as there is one common prime factor.

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. 

So, 6#6 = 2 as there are two common prime factors: 2 and 3.

Now our expression simplifies to 1 + 2 which equals 3. 

So, our solution is ""The answer is 3."""

Given Problem: 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3

Step 1 (Parentheses): 
Here, we must perform the operation in the parentheses first. 
14 + 4 = 18
So, the equation becomes: 
6@18 + 12-2 # 3

Step 2 (Exponents): 
There are no exponents in this equation, so we move on to the next operation.

Step 3 (Prime Factor Counting): 
Now, we need to perform the Prime Factor Counting operation. 
2 # 3 = 0    (because there are no shared prime factors)
So, the equation now becomes: 
6@18 + 12 - 0 

Step 4 (Multiplication and Division): 
There are no multiplication or division operations in the equation.

Step 5 (Addition and Subtraction):
Now, we need to perform the addition operation. 
12 - 0 = 12
So, the equation becomes: 
6@18 + 12

Now, we perform the next addition operation:
18 + 12 = 30
And, the equation becomes: 
6@30

Step 6 (Concatenation): 
Finally, we perform the concatenation operation.
6@30 = 630

So, based on the updated order of operations, the answer to the given mathematics problem is 630. 

The answer is 630."

The operation # (Prime Factor Counting) should be computed before the addition operation according to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC):

Step 1: Calculate 3#2. Here 3 is prime with a factor of 3, and 2 is prime with a factor of 2. Since they do not share a common prime factor the result is 0.

So 3#2 = 0.

The expression now becomes: 5 + 0

Step 2: The remaining operation is addition. Add 5 and 0 to get 5.

So, The answer is 5."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together.

                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)

6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3

This becomes:

6@18 + 12-2  #  3


Step 2: Move onto the Exponents (E), but there are none in the equation.


Step 3: Proceed to Prime Factor Counting (F):

12-2  #  3 = 10 # 3 = 1
(Since only 1 common prime factor, which is 2, is there between 10 and 3.)

So, the original expression is now:

6@18 + 1


Step 4: Next, deal with Multiplication and Division (M/D), but there are none in the expression.


Step 5: Continue to Addition and Subtraction (A/S):

6@18 + 1 = 6@18 + 1 = 6@19


Step 6: The final step in PEFMDASC is Concatenation (C):

6@19 = 619

Step 1: deal with the Prime Factor counting (F)
In this function 3#2, we need to find unique prime factors that 3 and 2 share. 
The prime factor of 3 is 3 and prime factor of 2 is 2. 
Since there are no shared unique prime factors between numbers 3 and 2, 3#2 equals 0.

So,  3#2 = 0;

Step 2: Addition (A)
Now, the equation becomes 5 + 0;

We can readily see that adding 0 to any number does not change the number. 

So, the final answer is 5.

The answer is 5."
