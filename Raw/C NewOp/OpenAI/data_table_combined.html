      <td>GPT Response: Let's break down the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 by applying the updated order of operations:<br><br>1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Evaluate the prime factor counting operations first, before any addition.<br><br>For 8 # 2:<br>- The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or 2^3).<br>- The prime factors of 2 are just 2.<br>- They share one prime factor: 2.<br>So, 8 # 2 = 1.<br><br>For 6 # 6:<br>- The prime factors of the first 6 are 2 and 3.<br>- The prime factors of the second 6 are also 2 and 3.<br>- They share the same prime factors: 2 and 3. However, the count of unique prime factors they share is just 2 (as factors don't count more than once).<br>So, 6 # 6 = 2.<br><br>2. Addition (A): Now, perform the addition with the results from the prime factor counting.<br><br>1 (from 8 # 2) + 2 (from 6 # 6) = 3.<br><br>So, the final answer is 3. <br><br>The answer is 3.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Let's solve the given problem step by step according to the updated order of operations, PEFMDASC (Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction, Concatenation):<br><br>The problem provided is: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6<br><br>The new operation to consider here is Prime Factor Counting, which we evaluate before addition. So let's perform the prime factor counting operations first:<br><br>For 8 # 2:<br>The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or 2^3).<br>The prime factor of 2 is 2.<br>The prime factors they share is just one 2.<br>Thus, 8 # 2 = 1 (since there is one unique shared prime factor, which is 2).<br><br>For 6 # 6:<br>The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.<br>Since both numbers are the same, they share both prime factors.<br>Thus, 6 # 6 = 2 (since there are two unique shared prime factors, which are 2 and 3).<br><br>Now the equation becomes:<br>1 + 2<br><br>Perform the addition:<br>1 + 2 = 3<br><br>So the final answer is:<br>The answer is 3.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Let's follow the revised order of operations PEFMDASC to calculate the expression \(8 \# 2 + 6 \# 6\).<br><br>1. Prime Factor Counting (F):<br>The first step according to the new order of operations is to perform the prime factor counting operation which we denote with \(\#\).<br><br>- For \(8 \# 2\), the prime factors of 8 are \(2 \times 2 \times 2\), and the prime factors of 2 are \(2\). The shared prime factor is \(2\), but since it's the only one, it's counted just once. So, \(8 \# 2 = 1\).<br>- For \(6 \# 6\), the prime factors of both 6s are \(2\) and \(3\). The count of shared prime factors is \(2\), since both \(2\) and \(3\) are shared.<br>   <br>Thus, the expression simplifies to:<br>\(1 + 2\).<br><br>2. Addition (A):<br>Now we just have to add the results from the prime factor counting operation:<br><br>\(1 + 2 = 3\).<br><br>So, after performing the given operations in the correct order, the final answer is:<br>The answer is 3.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we must follow the order of operations. The updated order of operations prioritized as Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction, and Concatenation.<br><br>An initial glance at the problem shows it contains parentheses, prime factor counting, addition, subtraction, and concatenation. Let's break down the steps:<br><br>Initial Mathematical Problem: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3<br><br>Step 1 - Parentheses (P):<br>Inside the parentheses, we have 14 + 4, which equals 18.<br>So our equation now is: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3<br><br>Step 2 - Prime Factor Counting (F):<br>Next operation to handle is Prime Factor Counting, denoted by #. To simplify 2 # 3, we're checking for common prime factors. The prime factor of 2 is 2, and the prime factor of 3 is 3, so they have no prime factors in common. This equals 0.<br>So our equation now is: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0<br><br>Step 3 - Addition and Subtraction (A/S):<br>Within this step, we perform the operations from left to right. First, we address the addition, 18 + 12 = 30. After this, we address subtraction, 30 - 0 = 30.<br>So our equation now is: 6 @ 30<br><br>Step 4 - Concatenation (C):<br>Finally, we'll use the Concatenation operation. Concatenation joins the digits together, in this case, 6 and 30 become 630.<br><br>Hence, based on the newly updated order of operations: <br><br>The answer is 630.</td>

(F) Prime Factor Counting operation before (A) Addition.<br><br>First, we need to compute each Prime Factor Counting operation:<br><br>8 # 2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or 2^3). The prime factors of 2 is just 2. Therefore, there is 1 shared prime factor: 2.<br>8 # 2 = 1<br><br>6 # 6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. The prime factors of 6 for the other operand are the same (since it's the same number). There are 2 shared prime factors (2 and 3).<br>6 # 6 = 2<br><br>2. (A) Addition<br><br>Now we add the results of the Prime Factor Counting operations:<br>1 + 2 = 3<br><br>Therefore, the final answer is:<br>The answer is 3.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve the given mathematical problem using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we will start by performing the prime factor counting operation first, followed by addition.<br><br>8 # 2: We need to count the number of unique prime factors that the absolute values of 8 and 2 share. The prime factorization of 8 is 2 multiplied by itself three times (2 * 2 * 2), while the prime factor of 2 is just 2 itself. Since 2 is a prime factor in both numbers, this count is 1.<br><br>6 # 6: We need to count the number of unique prime factors that the absolute values of 6 and 6 share. The prime factorization of 6 is 2 * 3. Since 6 shares the same prime factors with itself, which are 2 and 3, this count is 2 (both 2 and 3 are unique prime factors shared by the numbers).<br><br>Now we have:<br><br>8 # 2 + 6 # 6<br>= 1 + 2 (from the prime factor counts calculated above)<br><br>Next, we perform the addition:<br><br>1 + 2 = 3<br><br>Therefore, the final answer is:<br><br>The answer is 3.</td>

The prime factor of 2 is 2. So, they share the prime factor 2 and there is only one unique prime factor which is 2, which means \( 8 # 2 = 1 \).<br>- \( 6 # 6 \): The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since both numbers are the same, they share the same prime factors. In this case, there are two unique shared prime factors which are 2 and 3, hence \( 6 # 6 = 2 \).<br><br>Now we can apply the addition part (A/S):<br><br>\[ (8 # 2) + (6 # 6) \]<br>\[ 1 + 2 \]<br>\[ = 3 \]<br><br>So the final answer is: \( \text{The answer is 3.} \)</td>

(F) Prime Factor counting: We need to find the number of shared unique prime factors between each set of numbers before doing any addition.<br><br>- 8 # 2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or just 2 if considering unique prime factors), and the prime factor of 2 is 2.

For this problem, we only need to consider Prime Factor Counting (F) and Addition (A), as there are no parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, subtraction, or concatenation involved.<br><br>First, we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation:<br><br>1. 8#2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2, while the prime factors of 2 are just 2.

      <td>GPT Response: Let's proceed step-by-step using the PEFMDASC order of operations.<br><br>1. Prime Factor Counting (F) — We need to perform prime factor counting before addition. Let's calculate each component:<br>   - 8#2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or 2^3), and the prime factor of 2 is 2. The shared prime factor is 2. So, 8#2 gives us 1 unique shared prime factor.<br>   - 6#6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since both numbers we are comparing are the same, they share the same prime factors. So, here, we have 2 shared prime factors (2 and 3), but remember, we're looking for the count of unique prime factors, so the result is 2.<br><br>2. Addition (A) — Now, we add the results from the prime factor counting.<br>   - 1 (from 8#2) + 2 (from 6#6) = 3<br><br>3. The final answer is:<br>   The answer is 3.</td>

Therefore, 6#6 = 2.<br><br>Now, the expression from step (i) and (ii) becomes:<br><br>(iii) 1 + 2<br><br>Simple addition gives us 3. <br>So, the final answer is 3. <br><br>"The answer is 3."</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve the given problem under the newly updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we follow the steps:<br><br>1. Evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F). Here 8#2 means the common unique prime factors 8 and 2 share. 8 is 2's multiple (2,4,8) and 2 itself is a prime number. Therefore, there is 1 common unique prime factor (2).<br>   Similarly, 6#6 means the common unique prime factors 6 and 6 share. For number 6, there are prime factors 2 and 3, therefore it has 2 unique prime factors.<br>   <br>   8#2 + 6#6 = 1 + 2.<br><br>2. Perform Addition (A).<br><br>   1 + 2 = 3.<br><br>Therefore, The answer is 3.</td>
