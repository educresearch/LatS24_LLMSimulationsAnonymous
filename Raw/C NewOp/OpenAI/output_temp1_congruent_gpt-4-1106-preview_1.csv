5 + 2 @ 4

According to PEFMDASC, we go through the order of operations step by step. In this case, there are no parentheses (P), exponents (E), prime factor counting (F), multiplication (M), division (D), or subtraction (S) to perform. Therefore, we move straight to addition (A) and then concatenation (C):

- Perform addition (A):

5 + 2 = 7

- Now perform the concatenation (C) of the result with 4:

7 @ 4

This is a direct concatenation of the digits, which results in:

724

Thus, the final answer is 724.

Problem: 8#2 + 6#6

First, we will evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (#) operation because it comes before addition (A) in the order of operations.

1. Evaluate 8#2
  The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or 2^3)
  The prime factors of 2 are 2
  The count of unique prime factors shared by 8 and 2 is 1 since they only share the prime factor 2.

So, 8#2 = 1

2. Evaluate 6#6
  The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3
  The prime factors of 6 (again) are 2 and 3
  The count of unique prime factors shared by 6 and 6 is 2 since they share both the prime factors 2 and 3.

So, 6#6 = 2

Now, continue with the addition:

3 + 2 = 5

Given expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
First, we solve the expression within the parentheses.
14 + 4 = 18

The expression now becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents in the expression to solve.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
We solve the prime factor counting operation next.
2 # 3 analyzes the unique prime factors of 2 and 3. The prime factors of 2 are just 2, and for 3, it is just 3. They do not share any common prime factors.
So, 2 # 3 = 0

The expression now becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication (M) and Division (D)
There is no multiplication or division to be performed.

Step 5: Addition (A) and Subtraction (S)
We perform addition and subtraction from left to right.
12 - 0 = 12

The expression now becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
Finally, we perform the concatenation operation, which is left to right.
6 @ 18 = 618 (since it simply joins the numbers at a digit level)

Now we add that result to 12:
618 + 12 = 630

The final answer after performing all the operations according to the expanded order is 630.
The answer is 630."

                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses

                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

4 # 3 + 2

First, we evaluate the prime factor counting:

The prime factors of 4 are 2 (since 4 = 2^2),
The prime factors of 3 are 3.

Since there are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, the result of 4 # 3 is 0.

Given expression: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
First, we solve the expression within the parentheses:

\( (14 + 4) \)

This gives us:

\( 18 \)

The expression now becomes:

\( 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 \)

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents in the expression, so we can proceed to the next step.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
We need to evaluate the prime factor counting next. The operation is:

\( 2 # 3 \)

Since 2 and 3 are both prime and do not share any prime factors, the result is:

\( 0 \)

The expression now becomes:

\( 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 \)

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
There's no multiplication or division to carry out, so we move on.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Before we perform the concatenation, we should carry out addition and subtraction in order from left to right:

\( 12 - 0 \)

This gives us:

\( 12 \)

Now the addition:

\( 6 @ 18 + 12 \)

Since addition comes before concatenation in the order of operations, we first add 18 and 12:

\( 18 + 12 = 30 \)

The expression now becomes:

\( 6 @ 30 \)

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
The last step is to perform the concatenation:

\( 6 @ 30 \)

By definition, concatenation is the joining of digits:

\( 630 \)

Thus, the final answer is:

The answer is 630."

Since there are no parentheses, exponents, or prime factor counting to consider in this expression, we move straight to the addition and subtraction and then the concatenation. 

1. Perform the addition (5 + 2):
5 + 2 = 7

2. Perform the concatenation (7 @ 4):
Since concatenation is not dependent on the sign of the number, we can concatenate the digits as they are:
7 @ 4 = 74

The final answer is 74."

4. Concatenation (C) (from left to right)

Given the mathematical expression 8#2 + 6#6, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting first:

First term - 8#2:
- The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or 2^3).
- The prime factors of 2 are just 2.
Since 2 is a common prime factor, 8#2 will result in counting one unique prime factor, so 8#2 = 1.

Second term - 6#6:
- The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
Since 6 shares all its prime factors with itself, 6#6 will result in counting two unique prime factors, so 6#6 = 2.

Now we have:
1 + 2

Which is an addition operation:
1 + 2 = 3

Therefore, the final answer after performing the new operation of prime factor counting followed by addition is:

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S) (left to right)
6. Concatenation (C) (left to right)

Given problem: 6@(14+4) + 12 - 2 #  3

Step 1: Evaluate parentheses first
6@(14+4) + 12 - 2 #  3
= 6@(18) + 12 - 2 #  3

Step 2: No exponents to evaluate.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
6@(18) + 12 - 2 #  3
Let's evaluate the prime factor counting of 2 and 3:
The prime factor of 2 is 2.
The prime factors of 3 are 3.
There is no common prime factor, so the result is 0.

Step 4: No multiplication or division to evaluate.

Step 5: Addition and subtraction (left to right)
Now let's perform the addition and subtraction:

                    It's essential that you grasp these new concepts quickly and efficiently to provide clear and helpful responses.

                    New Operations Introduced:

                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a@b, this operation merges the digits of |a| and |b|. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a@b = |a|@|b| = |12|@|-56| = 12@56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a@b = 0@24 = 024 = 24.
                    Please make sure you understand this properly; it's simple yet fundamental.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted as a#b, it counts the unique prime factors common to |a| and |b|. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.
                    It's crucial to get this right for accurate calculations.
                    
                    Updated Order of Operations: PEFMDASC:

                    A/S: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
                    C: Concatenation (left to right)
                    Your ability to adapt to these changes is vital. 
                    These aren't just theoretical concepts; they're practical tools that require your immediate attention and understanding.

                    Important Examples Demonstrating New Operations and Order:
                    (i) 5 @ 3 + 6
                    = 5 @ 9 (since we need to evaluate addition before concatenation)
                    = 59

                    (ii) 5 # 3 + 6
                    = 0 + 6 (since we need to evaluate prime factorization before addition)
                    = 6

                    (iii) 5 - 3 @ 6
                    = 2 @ 6 (since we need to evaluate subtraction before concatenation)
                    = 26

                    (iv) 5 - 3 # 6
                    = 5 - 1 (since we need to evaluate prime factorization before subtraction)
                    = 4

                    (vi) (3 + 10 # 2) * 5 @ 42 
                    = (3 + 1) * 5 @ 42 (we need to evaluate what is in the parenthesis first and prime factor counting is before addition)
                    = 4 * 5 @ 42  (we need to evaluate multiplication before concatenation
                    = 20 @ 42 = 2042. (concatenation is last)

- P: Parentheses: There are no parentheses to evaluate in this problem.
- E: Exponents: There are no exponents to evaluate in this problem.
- F: Prime Factor Counting (F): We evaluate this next, looking at the prime factors of 3 and 2.
  - The prime factors of 3 are {3} because 3 is a prime number.
  - The prime factors of 2 are {2} because 2 is also a prime number.
  - There are no common prime factors between 3 and 2.
  - So, 3#2 equals 0 since there are 0 shared prime factors.

Now that we have conducted the prime factor counting, we can look at the rest of the operations:

- M/D: Multiplication and Division: There are none in this problem.
- A/S: Addition and Subtraction: We can continue with the addition.
  - Since 3#2 equals 0, we replace it and add 5 + 0.

- C: Concatenation: There is no concatenation operation in this problem.

Therefore, the final calculation is 5 + 0, which equals 5.

The answer is 5."

1. Prime Factor counting (F)
The first step is to perform the prime factor count operation:
a. \( 8#2 \): The prime factor of 8 is 2 (as \(8 = 2^3\)) and the prime factor of 2 is 2. Therefore, \( 8#2 \) is 1 since there is one shared prime factor, which is 2.
b. \( 6#6 \): The prime factors for 6 are 2 and 3. Since we're counting the shared prime factors of 6 and 6, we have two shared prime factors: 2 and 3. Thus, \( 6#6 \) is 2.

2. Addition (A)
Now, we continue with the addition operation:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): This step comes before Addition (A). We need to calculate the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 4 and 3.

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (4 = 2 x 2), and the prime factor of 3 is 3. There are no shared prime factors, so the result of this operation is 0.

So, 4 # 3 becomes 0.

2. Addition (A): We now add the result from step 1 to 2.

0 + 2 equals 2.

The given expression is: 6@(14+4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses (P)
First, we calculate the expression inside the parentheses.

14 + 4 = 18

Now our expression looks like this: 6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Exponents (E)
There are no exponents to evaluate in this expression.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
We need to calculate the prime factor counting for -2 and 3. 

The prime factors of |2| (which is 2) are just 2 itself since it is a prime number.
The prime factors of |3| (which is 3) are just 3 itself since it is also a prime number.

Since 2 and 3 do not share any prime factors, the prime factor counting operation for these numbers is 0.

2 # 3 = 0

Now the expression looks like this: 6@18 + 12 - 0

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
There are no multiplication or division operations to perform.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
We perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:

12 - 0 = 12

Now add this result to the rest of the expression, which hasn't been simplified:

6@18 + 12

Step 6: Concatenation (C)
Finally, we perform the concatenation:

6 @ 18 = 618

Now that we've completed the concatenation, we add 12 to it as per our previous simplification:

618 + 12 = 630

Putting it all together, our steps have resulted in the final answer:

The answer is 630."
