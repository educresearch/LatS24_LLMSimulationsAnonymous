The given expression is:
5+2 @ 4

Applying the order of operations:
(i) Addition comes before Concatenation in order, thus, we need to perform 5+2 first.
(ii) 5+2 = 7.
(iii) After addition, the updated expression is 7 @ 4.
(iv) Performing the concatenation operation, 7 @ 4 = 74.

As the only operation was addition and concatenation in this case, the answer was determined straightforwardly following the updated order of operation.

Given:
8#2 + 6#6

Firstly, we have to evaluate the prime factor counting operations due to PEFMDASC.
8#2 = 1 (since the shared prime factor between |8| (2) and |2| (2) is 2 )
6#6 = 1 (since 6 has only one prime factor, that's 2, shared with itself)

So, the given problem reduces to: 
1 + 1

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

The problem is 8#2 + 6#6. 

According to Prime Factor Counting (F):
- 8 and 2 both have the prime factor 2, so 8#2 = 1.
- 6 has the prime factors 2 and 3. As 6 and 6 are the same number, they have the exact same prime factors. So 6#6 = 2.

Substituting these values into the given expression, the problem becomes 1 + 2. 

To solve it, we need to follow the PEFMDASC order of operations. As per the order, the operation to be done here involve addition:

1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3."

systemPrompt3_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: First, we look at the operation Prime Factor Counting (F) because it comes before addition (A) in the updated Order of Operations (PEFMDASC).

In this case, the prime factors of 3 are just 3 itself, and the prime factors of 2 are just 2 itself. They don't have any shared prime factors. Hence, 3#2 equals 0.

So, the equation becomes 5 + 0.

Finally, we perform the addition operation, and the equation simplifies to 5. 

Therefore, the answer is 5."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

Start-off Expression: 5 + 2 @ 4

Step 1 - Parentheses (P): There are no parentheses, so we move on to the next step.

Step 2 - Exponents (E): Again, no exponents in the expression, so we proceed to the next step.

Step 3 - Prime Factor Counting (F): There are also no prime factor counts to perform, so we skip to the next step.

Step 4 - Multiplication or Division (M/D): No multiplication or division operations are present in the expression, so let's move to the next step.

Step 5 - Addition or Subtraction (A/S): Yes, there is an addition operation. We perform the addition operation before concatenation due to the revised order of operations.
So, our operation becomes: 5 + 2 = 7.

Step 6 - Concatenation (C):  We now execute the concatenation operation.

According to our new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we do Prime Factor Counting (F) before Addition (A). So, let's first calculate the prime factor counts.

To calculate 8#2:
The prime factors of |8| (which is 8 itself) are 2 (2*2*2) and the prime factor of |2| (which is 2 itself) is also 2. Since 2 is the only prime factor common between 8 and 2, the count is 1. So, 8#2 = 1.

To calculate 6#6:
The prime numbers in |6| (which is 6 itself) are 2 and 3. Since the numbers are same in this operation, all the prime factors are shared. So the count is 2. Hence, 6#6 = 2.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: The expression given is 6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3. 

To solve this expression, we must follow the PEFMDASC order of operations. The steps include solving for Parentheses, Exponents, prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right, and finally Concatenation from left to right.

Step 1 - Parentheses:
First, we solve the operation within parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18
So, the expression becomes: 6@18 + 12-2  # 3

Step 2 - Prime Factor Counting (F):
Next, we compute the prime factor counting for 12-2 and 3: 
As 2 has only one prime number 2 and 3 has only one prime number 3, there are no shared prime factors between them. So, the result is 0. 
So, our expression simplifies to: 6@18 + 0

Step 3 - Addition/Subtraction (A/S):
We perform addition or subtraction from left to right. In our case, we have the addition operation: 6@18 + 0 = 6@18
So, the expression becomes: 6@18

Step 4 - Concatenation (C):
Finally, we perform the concatenation: 6 @ 18 = 618.

So, the final answer to the given expression 6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3 using the order  PEFMDASC is 618. 

The answer is 618."

Step 1: Parentheses. There are no parentheses, so there is nothing to do in this step.

Step 2: Exponents. There are no exponents in this expression, so we skip to the next step.

Step 3: Prime Factor counting (F)
We perform 3#2. To perform prime factor counting, we list the prime factors of each number.
The prime factor for 3 is 3 and prime factor for 2 is 2. So, there are no common prime factors between 3 and 2. Therefore, 3#2 = 0.

The expression now is:
5 + 0

Step 4: Multiplication and Division. There are no multiplication or division operations in this expression, so we skip to the next step.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S). Now we perform the addition.
5 + 0 is 5.

Step 6: Concatenation (C). There is no concatenation operation in this expression, so we have our final result.
