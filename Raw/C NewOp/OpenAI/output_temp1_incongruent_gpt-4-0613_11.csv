systemPrompt1_userPrompt2_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: This expression requires the use of operations in the order mentioned in the PEFMDASC rule. 

First, the 'Prime Factor Counting' operation (#) must be performed before 'Addition' operation (+). 

Firstly, evaluate '8 # 2', which represents the count of unique prime factors shared by |8| and |2|. Both 8 and 2 share one unique prime factor which is 2. 

So, 8 # 2 = 1

Next, evaluate '6 # 6', which represents the count of unique prime factors shared by |6| and |6|. Prime factor of 6 is {2,3}, as both numbers are the same, the count of unique prime factors shared is 2.

So, 6 # 6 = 2

Replacing in the original equation, we get: 

1 + 2

Adding these gets us 3.

So, the answer to the expression '8 # 2+6 # 6' applying the new PEFMDASC rule for order of operations is 3.

systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations PEFMDASC, starting from parentheses all the way to concatenation operation.

First, we evaluate what is in the parentheses: 
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we calculate the Prime Factor Counting operation:
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1
(since the prime factors of 2 are {2} and the prime factors of 3 are {3}, there are no shared prime factors, hence the answer is 0. We can use this result to simplify the equation to:

= 6 @ 18 + 11

Then, we do the addition (before concatenation):
= 6 @ 29

Finally, execute the concatenation operation (which is the last operation to be performed):
= 629

Therefore, the answer to the given mathematics problem is 629, with the final answer rendered as: The answer is 629."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)

                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

Step 1: Using the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to evaluate the Prime Factor Counting operations (#) first.

Here, we have:
8 # 2 = 1 (since 2 is a prime factor of 8)
And
6 # 6 = 1 (since 6 only has 1 unique prime factor, which is 3)

Step 2: So, the expression is now simplified to: 1 + 1.

Approach:
The new 'PEFMDASC' order of operations tells us that we need to evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (#) operation before the Addition (+) operation.

First, we will evaluate 4#3.
The prime factor of 4 is 2 and the prime factor of 3 is 3. There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, i.e., 0.

So, the expression simplifies to 0 + 2.

First, we need to perform the operations in parentheses (P), but there are no parentheses in the expression. 

Then, we evaluate the exponents (E), which also do not exist.

Next step is to perform the prime factor counting(F), but there is none.

Then, we perform multiplication and division (M/D), which also do not exist.

After that, we do addition and subtraction(A/S). In the given expression, we have the addition operation 5 + 2:

5 + 2 = 7

After performing the addition operation, the expression has now been simplified to: 7 @ 4

Lastly, according to the order of operation(C), the final operation to be solved is '@' operator. It involves the concatenation of 7 and 4:

1. Parentheses - P: In the given expression, we need to handle the operation within the Parentheses first: (14+4).

    6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
    = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3
   
2. Prime Factor Counting - F: Evalute the Prime Factor Counting operation next: 2#3.

    6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3
    = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (since 2 and 3 both have the prime factor of 2).

3. Addition/Subtraction - A/S: We do additions and subtractions next, moving from left to right.

    6 @ 18 + 12 - 1
    = 6 @ 18 + 11 (Subtract)
    = 6 @ 29 (Add)

4. Concatenation - C: Finally, carry out the Concatenation operation: 6 @ 29.

    6 @ 29

The answer is 629."

Our expression is 5 + 3 # 2.

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F) - We have 3 # 2 as the prime factor counting operation.
Prime factors of 3 are {3}, and prime factors of 2 are {2}. There're no common prime factors, so 3 # 2 = 0.

So the expression becomes 5 + 0.

Step 2: Addition (A): Now, we simply add 5 and 0 to get 5.

So the final result is 5.
