gpt-4-0613,1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: Based on the new rules of operation, we first perform the prime factor counting operation (#), and then the addition operation.

4 # 3 = 0 
(since the prime factors of 4 are 2 whereas the prime factor of 3 is 3. Therefore, there are no shared prime factors.)

So the expression turns to 0 + 2 = 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: The problem 4 # 3 + 2 can be solved with the updated order of operations PEFMDASC. 

Step 1: Calculate Prime Factor Counting (F)
The prime factors of 4 are {2}, and the prime factors of 3 are {3}. They don't have common prime factors, so 4 # 3 = 0.

Step 2: Calculate Addition (A)
Now the equation turns into 0 + 2 = 2.

So the final result is 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: In the given math problem, you first need to perform the Prime Factor counting operation (F) because F (i.e., Prime Factor Counting) comes before A (i.e., Addition) in the updated order of operations, PEFMDASC.

The prime factor of 4 is 2, and the prime factor of 3 is 3. There are no common prime factors between 4 and 3, so 4#3 equals 0.

Now, you can perform the addition operation. Adding the result obtained by Prime Factor Counting (0) to 2 gives 0+2=2.

So, the answer to the mathematical problem 4 # 3+2 following the updated order of operations PEFMDASC is:

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: The given mathematical expression is: 4 # 3 + 2

Step 1: Apply the Prime Factor Counting (F). According to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), Prime Factor Counting (F) comes before Addition (A). So we first perform 4 # 3:

Prime factors of |4| are {2}, and prime factors of |3| are {3}. Since these sets of prime factors do not share any common factors, 4 # 3 = 0.

Now, the expression simplifies to: 0 + 2

Step 2: Apply Addition (A). We have 0 + 2 = 2.

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: Based on the new rules of operation, the prime factor counting operation (#) should be performed first before the addition operation.

Let's start by performing the prime factor counting (#) operation:

- The number 3 has one prime factor, i.e., 3 itself.
- The number 2 has one prime factor, i.e., 2 itself.
- However, these two numbers do not share any prime factors.

Hence, 3#2 = 0.

Now performing the addition:

5 + 3#2 becomes 5 + 0, which equals to 5.

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: The problem 5 + 3#2 is evaluated considering the new operation order PEFMDASC, which states that Prime Factor Counting (F) should be done before Addition (A).

First, we need to perform the Prime Factor Counting operation 3#2:
Prime factors of 3 are just 3, and prime factors of 2 are just 2. There is no shared prime factor, thus 3#2 = 0.

So, our problem becomes 5 + 0, which simplifies to 5.

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: In the given math problem, you first need to perform the Prime Factor counting operation (F) because according to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, F comes before addition.

Starting with 3#2:
Prime factors of 3 are 3, and prime factors of 2 are 2. They have no shared prime factors, hence 3#2 = 0

The problem now becomes: 
5 + 0
Perform the operation:
5 + 0 = 5 

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: The given mathematical expression is: 5 + 3#2, where # denotes the prime factor counting operation.

We use the revised order of operations PEFMDASC, where the first step is Parentheses (P), but there aren't any parenthetical expressions in the given equation. 

The next step is Exponents (E), but there are no exponents either.

The third step involves using the new Prime Factor Counting operation (F). We do have this operation in our equation: 3#2. 

The prime factors of 3 are [3] and the prime factors of 2 are [2]. There are no shared prime factors, so this operation results in 0.

Let's simplify the expression:

5 + 3#2
= 5 + 0

The last step involves Addition (A) and we end up with:

5 + 0 = 5.

So, the answer to the given equation, 5 + 3#2, is 5. 

The answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Based on the new rules of operation, we need to handle the addition operation before the concatenation operation.

So, first, we calculate 5 + 2, which results in 7.

Then, we perform the concatenation operation of our result with 4. Therefore, 7 @ 4 = 74.

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: Following the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:

First, we need to perform the addition operation, because it comes before the concatenation operation in the updated order of operations.

So we have: 
     5 + 2 @ 4
    = 7 @ 4

Then, perform the concatenation:

     7 @ 4
    = 74

So, the answer is 74.","GPT Response: In the given math problem, you have the operations addition and concatenation. 

Given our new rules of operation (PEFMDASC), addition (A) comes before concatenation (C). So, we first solve 5+2, and then concatenate the result with 4. 

Now, let's proceed to calculate it:

5+2 @ 4
= 7 @ 4 (solving the addition first)
= 74  (solving the concatenation next)

So, the answer to the given math problem is 74.

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: The given mathematical expression is: 5+2 @ 4, where '+' denotes addition and '@' denotes concatenation.

Below are the steps to solve this using the appropriate order of operations (PEFMDASC):

1. Evaluate Addition: As per the updated order of operations, addition operation (A) is evaluated after prime factor counting (F) but before concatenation (C). We need to process the addition first, i.e., 5 + 2. 

     So, 5 + 2 = 7.

2. Perform Concatenation: After completing the addition operation, the expression becomes 7 @ 4. We now perform the concatenation operation, which involves joining the digits of 7 and 4 together.

    Therefore, 7 @ 4 = 74.

So, the result of the expression 5+2 @ 4 is 74.

Therefore, the answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: To handle the problem efficiently, we need to stick to the newly defined order of operations (PEFMDASC):

i.e., Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), and then Concatenation (from left to right).

Let's solve the given problem:

Problem:  6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3

First step (P, parentheses):

6@(18) + 12 - 2 # 3

Second step (F, Prime Factor counting): There is no prime factor counting except at the end of the expression. 

Third step (M, multiplication and D, division): There is no multiplication or division present in the expression.

Fourth step (A, addition) :

6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3 = 

6@18 + 10 # 3

Fifth step (C, Concatenation):

618 + 10 # 3

Sixth step (A, addition):

628 # 3

Finally, (F, Prime Factor counting), to calculate the number of unique prime factors shared by 628 and 3, we see that 3 is a prime number with no factors other than 1 and 3 itself, and 628 doesn't contain 3 as a factor. So, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 0.

So, the expression turns out to be 0 after the computation. Thus, we can say that

The answer is 0.","GPT Response: First, we calculate parentheses (P) : 

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 

Next in the order is Prime Factor Counting (F). The unique prime factors of 2 is 2 and that of 3 is 3. They don't share any prime factors. Therefore, 2 # 3 is equal to 0. The equation becomes:

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

As Prime Factor Counting operation has higher precedence than Concatenation, we must do this step before Concatenation, even if the number looks to the right side of the # number in the equation.

Since there is no Exponents (E), Multiplication (M) or Division (D), we move to Addition and Subtraction (A/S):

= 6 @ 18 + 12 

= 6 @ 30

Finally, Concatenation (C) operation:

= 630

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 630.","GPT Response: Going by PEFMDASC, our first step is to handle what's inside parentheses:

6@(14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 
= 6@18 + 12 - 2 # 3   

Next, according to our order of operations, we'll proceed with the prime factor counting operation (#):

6@18 + 12 - 1
= 6@18 + 11  (since 2 # 3 = 1 as 2 and 3 are both primes but they are not shared)

Now we handle the concatenation operation (@):

618 + 11 
= 629  (since 6@18 = 618)

Finally, we'll deal with the addition:

The answer is 640.","GPT Response: First, let's tackle the operations inside the Parentheses:

6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3
= 6@(18) + 12-2  #  3  (14 + 4 = 18)

We perform the concatenation operation next, according to the order of operations PEFMDASC, 

= 618 + 12-2  #  3

Then we perform addition and subtraction from left to right,

= 630 - 2  #  3  (618 + 12 = 630)

= 628 # 3 (630 - 2 = 628)

Last, we determine the number of unique prime factors shared by 628 and 3. 628 has prime factors 2 and 157. 3 is a prime number itself. They don't share any prime factors, so the operation 628 # 3 equals 0.

The answer is 0."
gpt-4-0613,1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: First, we have to execute the prime factor counting operation before the addition operation since in the PEFMDASC, the prime factor counting (F) operation comes before the addition (A) operation. 

The prime factors of 8 are 2, and the prime factors of 2 are 2, so 8#2 = 1 (since 2 is the common prime factor).

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, so 6#6 = 2 (since 2 and 3 are the prime factors of 6).

Therefore,
8#2 + 6#6 
= 1 + 2 
= 3 

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Remembering our Order of Operations PEFMDASC:

P: Parentheses
E: Exponents
F: Prime Factor counting
M/D: Multiplication and Division (left to right)
A/S: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
C: Concatenation (left to right)

Let's rewrite the given problem to better visualizes the sequence of operation:
F(8,2) + F(6,6)
We do Prime Factor counting first.

Prime Factors of 8: 2
Prime Factors of 2: 2
Shared Prime Factors of 8 and 2: 2, thus F(8,2) = 1

Then, 

Prime Factors of 6: 2, 3
Prime Factors of 6: 2, 3
Shared Prime Factors of 6 and 6: 2, 3, thus F(6,6) = 2

So the rewritten problem becomes:
1 + 2, which according to order of operations we simply do the addition next and it equals to 3.

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: The given problem is 8 # 2 + 6 # 6. 

We know that the Prime Factor Counting operation has higher precedence than addition in our new order of operations PEFMDASC.

Let's simplify it step by step:
(a) The unique prime factors of 8 are 2, and the unique prime factors of 2 are also 2.
So, 8 # 2 = 1 (since there is one common prime factor)

(b) The unique prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. 
Since 6 and 6 are the same number, they share the same unique prime factors.
So, 6 # 6 = 2 (since we have 2 common prime factors)

Now, we substitute these results back into the original equation: 

1 + 2 = 3. 

Therefore, the problem simplifies to:

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: We will solve the expression 8#2 + 6#6 using the PEFMDASC order, where Prime Factor Counting (F) is prioritized over Addition (A). 

Step 1: First identify the prime factors of the numbers
Prime factors of 8: 2 
Prime factors of 2: 2
Prime factors of 6: 2, 3

Step 2: Evaluate 8#2 and 6#6

8#2 calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 8 and 2.
There is one shared prime factor here, which is 2.
So, 8#2 = 1.

6#6 calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 6, which are 2 and 3. 
Here, all prime factors are shared because we are comparing the number with itself.
So, 6#6 = 2.

Step 3: Substitute these values back into the original problem, we get 
1 + 2.

Step 4: Perform addition, 
1 + 2 = 3.

The answer is 3."
