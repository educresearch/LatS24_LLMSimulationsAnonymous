systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: The problem given is 6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3. 

Let's begin breaking down the problem following the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. Parentheses first: 
Address the parentheses (14+4) to get 18.
So, the problem becomes: 6@18 + 12-2 # 3.

2. Then, evaluate the prime factor counting:
Next, find the shared prime factors between 2 and 3. As there are no shared prime factors, 2 # 3 is 0.
So, substitute this into the equation to get: 6@18 + 12-0.

3. The next operations to handle are multiplication and division, but they don't appear here.

4. So, move to addition and subtraction:
Evaluate 12 - 0 to get 12.
So, the problem becomes: 6@18 + 12.

5. Continue with addition and subtraction: 
Now we can do the addition to get: 6 @ 30.

6. The final operation is concatenation: 
Following the definition for concatenation, 6@30 gives us 630.

So, the final answer to the problem 6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3 is 630.

The answer is 630."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

5 + 3#2 

Based on the newly defined order of operations, we need to evaluate the prime factorization counting operation (#) before addition. 

The operation 3#2 means we need to find the count of unique prime factors common between 3 and 2. 

The prime factors of 3 are 3 itself and the prime factors of 2 are 2 itself. There are no common factors between 3 and 2, so 3#2 equals 0.

Then we replace 3#2 by 0 in the given problem, 

So, it becomes 5 + 0.

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting - According to the order of operations, we need to perform the Prime Factor Counting operation specified by the operator #. 

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 and for 3 it's 3. So, the number of unique prime factors shared by 4 and 3 is 0. Therefore, 
4 # 3 = 0.

Hence, our revised equation is now 0 + 2.

Step 2: Addition - Lastly, we then perform the Addition operation specified by the operator +.

So, 0 + 2 = 2.

Therefore, the answer to the given problem, following the newly established order of operations, is 2.

The answer is 2."

First, we handle the operation inside the parentheses (P).

Next, the Prime Factor Counting (F). 
Closely examining the equation: 12 and 3 share the common prime factor of 3. 

Hence, the prime factor count (F) of 12 and 3 is 1. We replace the prime factor count operation in the equation by the resultant number i.e,1.

Now we look at the left-to-right rule for Addition/Subtraction (A/S).

Following the order of operations outlined above (PEFMDASC), we have:

First, we evaluate the prime factorization counting operation (#):

Prime factors of 3 are {3}. Prime factors of 2 are {2}. They have no common factors. Therefore 3#2 = 0.

So, the equation becomes: 5 + 0.

Next, we evaluate the addition operation:

5 + 0 = 5.

Therefore, 

The answer is 5."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)

                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Let's break down the calculation using the updated order of operations: PEFMDASC. 

Step 1 (Parentheses): 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3 = 6@18 + 12-2 # 3
Here, the addition within parentheses `(14+4)` is calculated first.

Step 2 (Exponent): There are no exponents in this problem.

Step 3 (Prime Factor Counting): 6@18 + 12-2 # 3 = 6@18 + 12-1
The prime factor count of `2` and `3` is calculated as they both share only one prime factor which is `2`.

Step 4 (Multiplication/Division): There are no multiplication or division operations in this problem.

Step 5 (Addition/Subtraction): 6@18 + 12-1 = 6@18 + 11 
Here, the subtraction `12-1` is done.

Step 6 (Concatenation): 6@18 + 11 = 618 + 11
The numbers `6` and `18` are concatenated into `618`.

Step 7 (Addition/Subtraction - once again to finish off the addition): 618 + 11 = 629

So, the final result is 629.

The answer is 629."
