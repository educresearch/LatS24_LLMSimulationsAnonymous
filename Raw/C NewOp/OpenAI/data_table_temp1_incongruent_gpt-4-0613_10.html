      <td>GPT Response: Based on the new conventions, the order of operations now is PEFMDASC, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), and then Concatenation (from left to right).<br><br>Given the Mathematics problem: <br>5 + 2 @ 4, <br><br>We should first perform the addition operation since it comes before concatenation in the order of operations. <br><br>So, 5 + 2 = 7. <br><br>This gives us 7 @ 4.<br><br>Then, we perform the concatenation operation, which gives:<br><br>7 @ 4 = 74.<br><br>So, the final answer is 74.<br><br>Therefore, The answer is 74.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:<br>1. Evaluate Parentheses (P): There are no parentheses in the expression.<br>2.

Perform Multiplication or Division (M/D). There is no multiplication or division operation in the expression.<br>5. Perform Addition or Subtraction (A/S): We execute the addition operation 5 + 2, resulting in 7.<br>6. Perform Concatenation (C): Now we concatenate the result of addition operation with 4, getting 74.<br><br>The answer is 74.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: In this example, the order of operations according to the new rules PEFMDASC will be applied as follows:<br><br>First, since there is no Parentheses (P), Exponents (E), prime Factor Counting (F), Multiplication or Division (M/D) and Subtraction or Addition(A/S) to be done before Concatenation (C), we start with Concatenation:<br><br>2@4 becomes 24.<br><br>Then, carry out the Addition, as thatâ€™s next in PEFMDASC after Concatenation:<br><br>5 + 24 = 29.<br><br>The answer is 29.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC:<br>First, examine the expression for any Parentheses (P), Exponents (E), or Multiplication and Division (M/D). None of these are present.<br>Then, evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F). Here, we see 3 # 2, which means the count of unique prime factors shared by 3 and 2. Since, 3 is prime itself with prime factor 3 and 2 is prime with prime factor 2, they don't share any prime factors, this operation results in 0.<br>Now, you have 5 + 0. The Addition (A) falls next in the order of operations. Therefore, you'd then add 5 and 0 to get 5. There are no operations involving Subtraction (A) or Concatenation (C).<br>So, the solution to the math problem 5+3 # 2, according to the PEFMDASC order of operations, is 5.<br><br>The answer is 5.</td>

Here, we need to calculate the number of unique prime factors common to |3| and |2|. <br><br>The only prime factor of 2 is 2. The only prime factor of 3 is 3. There are no shared prime factors between 2 and 3, hence 3 # 2 = 0.<br><br>Follow this by adding this result to 5.<br><br>So, 5+3 # 2 = 5 + 0 = 5.<br><br>The answer is 5.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Following the order of operation PEFMDASC, the prime factor counting operation (#) is performed before the addition(+). <br><br>Firstly, let's calculate the prime factors of the absolute values of 3 and 2.<br>=> The prime factor of 3 is 3 and that of 2 is 2. <br><br>This means they do not share any prime factors, so 3 # 2 = 0. <br><br>Now, substitute this into the original problem:<br>=>  5 + 3 # 2 becomes 5 + 0. <br><br>Performing the addition, we get 5. <br><br>Thus, the answer is 5.</td>
