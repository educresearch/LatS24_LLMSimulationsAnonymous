gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: To solve this expression following the new order operations (PEFMDASC), let's break it down:

We have the expression '5 + 2 @ 4'. According to our new order of operations, we would have to execute addition before concatenation, so we start by executing '+'.

So, 5 + 2 = 7.

Now, we have 7 @ 4, which is the concatenation of 7 and 4. In the context of the concatenation operation, this expression would be interpreted as the number 7 followed by the number 4. 

So, 7 @ 4 = 74. 

Therefore, the result of the expression: 5 + 2 @ 4 = 74.

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: In this problem, we apply the rules of the new updated order of operations, which states that prime factorization (F) should be done before addition (A).

8 # 2 requires us to find the count of unique prime factors shared by 8 and 2. The prime factor for 8 is 2. The prime factor for 2 is also 2. Since they have the same prime number, it means they share one unique prime factor. So, 8 # 2 = 1.

6 # 6 requires us to find the count of unique prime factors shared by 6 and 6. The prime factors for 6 are 2 and 3. As the both numbers are the same (6 and 6), it's clear they share the same prime factors. So, 6 # 6 = 2 because the number 6 has two unique prime factors.

Now, you perform the addition:

1 + 2 equals 3.

Therefore, the answer to the problem is 3.

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this expression following the new order operations (PEFMDASC), let's break it down:

First, we calculate the result of the Prime Factor Counting operation (F): 4 # 3.

The prime factor of 4 is 2 and the prime factor of 3 is 3, therefore, they don't share any prime factor. So, 4 # 3 = 0. 

This simplifies our expression to: 0 + 2.

Finally, we perform addition (A), this gives us: 0 + 2 = 2. 

So, our final answer is 2.

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: Firstly, we need to do the parentheses operation:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we move on to Prime Factor Counting operation:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 
(since prime factors of 2 are 2 and unique prime factors of 3 are 3, they share no prime factors, so our result is 0)

Then, we need to do the subtraction before the addition operation:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 1
= 6 @ 18 + 11

Now we can perform the addition operation before the concatenation operation:

6 @ 18 + 11
= 6 @ 29

Lastly, the concatenation operation is performed:

6 @ 29
= 629

Therefore the solution to the mathematical problem 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 with the new convention and operations is 629.

The answer is 629."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve this expression following the new order operations, we carry out Prime Factor Counting operation before Addition:

Step 1: Find the unique prime factors of 3 and 2.
The prime factors of 3 are 3 and of 2 is 2. The unique shared prime factor between them is none, hence 3#2 = 0.

So the expression simplifies to: 5 + 0

Step 2: Finally, we do the remaining Addition operation, i.e., 5 + 0 = 5

Therefore,

The answer is 5."

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve the given Mathematics problem, we follow the new order of operations (PEFMDASC). 

Here are the steps:

(i) 8 # 2 + 6 # 6: We perform the Prime Factor counting operation first (F):

    Prime factors of 8: 2 
    Prime factors of 2: 2 
    Thus, 8 # 2 = 1 (as they share a single prime factor, 2)

    Prime factors of 6: 2, 3
    Prime factors of 6: 2, 3
    Thus, 6 # 6 = 2 (as they share two prime factors, 2 and 3)
    
(ii) Given that, the statement now becomes 1 + 2. We perform the remaining Addition operation (A): 1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the expression, 4 # 3 + 2, we follow the newly introduced order of operations (PEFMDASC). 

Starting with Prime Factor counting: 
4 # 3 = 0 
(because the prime factor of 4 is 2, and the prime factor of 3 is 3, so they don't have a common prime factor)

Now substituting this back into the original expression:

0 + 2 = 2.

The given operation is: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: P (Parentheses)
First calculate the expression within parentheses.

14 + 4 = 18.
So, the expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: F (Prime Factor Counting)
Calculate the number of unique prime factors shared by absolute values of 2 and 3.

The prime factors of 2 are [2] and the prime factors of 3 are [3]. They have no common factor. So, the prime factor counting operation 2#3 equals 0.

The expression becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3: A/S (Addition and Subtraction)
Calculate the addition: 18 + 12 = 30
Subtract 0 (doesn't change the value)

The expression becomes: 6 @ 30

Step 4: C (Concatenation)
Calculate the concatenation of the digits of 6 and 30.

6 @ 30 = 630

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: Following the order of operations PEFMDASC:

First, perform the operation in parentheses:

14 + 4 = 18

So, the expression now reads:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, perform the prime factor counting operation:

Prime factors of -2 are 2 and prime factors of 3 are 3. There is no shared prime factor, so 2 # 3 = 0

That transforms the expression to:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Next, perform the addition operation (A in PEFMDASC):

18 + 12 = 30

So, the expression changes to:

6 @ 30 - 0

Then, perform the concatenation operation:

6 @ 30 = 630

Our calculation now becomes:

630 - 0

Finally, perform the subtraction operation:

630 - 0 = 630

The answer is 630."

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: Firstly, evaluate F, the prime factor counting operation.

Step 1: Check the prime factors of the numbers involved. The prime factor of 8 is 2 and the prime factor of 2 is 2, hence, they share 1 prime factor i.e., 2. So, the result is 1.

8 # 2 = 1.

Next, do the same for the numbers 6 and 6.

Step 2: Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since it's the same number, the shared prime factors are the same as the original factors. So, there are two shared prime factors i.e., 2 and 3. So, 6 # 6 = 2.

Incorporate the results from the prime factor counting operation into the expression.

1 + 2 = 3.
So, the final answer is 3."

Step 2: Addition (A): Now, we perform the addition operation which gives us 0 + 2 = 2.

So, The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: Given the expression 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3, we'll use the new order of operations, PEFMDASC. 

1. Parentheses - P: In the given expression, we need to handle the operation within the Parentheses first: (14 + 4).
    So, 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 becomes:
    6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Exponents and Prime factor counting - E & F: We do not have any Exponents in this expression, so we immediately move on to F where we need to evaluate the Prime factor counting operation: 2 # 3
    Since the prime factor of 2 is 2 and the prime factor of 3 is 3, there are no shared prime factors between these two numbers, so their Prime factor counting equals to 0. 
    So, 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 becomes:
    6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

3. Multiplication and Division - M/D: There are no multiplication or division operations in the current expression so we move on to the next operation.

4. Addition and Subtraction - A/S: In our expression, we first need to handle addition before subtraction.
    First, we will handle Addition (A): 18 + 12.
    So, the expression becomes:
    6 @ 30 - 0

    Then, we will handle Subtraction (S): 30 - 0
    This simplifies the expression to:
    6 @ 30

5. Concatenation - C: Finally, we proceed to the last operation in the order of operations, Concatenation (C): 6 @ 30
    This concatenates the digits 6 and 30 together, resulting in 630."
