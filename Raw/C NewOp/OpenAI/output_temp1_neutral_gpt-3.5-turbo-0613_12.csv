2 has prime factor 2, so it also has 1 shared prime factor with itself.
6 has prime factors 2 and 3, so it has 0 shared prime factors with itself.
6 has prime factors 2 and 3, so it has 0 shared prime factors with itself.

systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: First, let's break down the given expression according to the order of operations:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses
Inside the parentheses, we have 14 + 4 which equals 18.

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting
The prime factors of 18 are 2 and 3. Since we have 3 in the prime factors, we would have 1 shared prime factor between 3 and 2.

6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

Step 3: Concatenation
The concatenation operation is performed from left to right. Let's start with 6 @ 18.

6 @ 18 equals 618.

So the expression now becomes:

618 + 12 - 1

Step 4: Addition and Subtraction
We perform addition and subtraction from left to right.

618 + 12 equals 630.

630 - 1 equals 629.

Therefore, the final answer is 629.

The answer is 629."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

Breaking it down step by step:
Step 1: Calculate the prime factor counting operation (#) between 3 and 2.
Since the prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2, there are no shared prime factors. Therefore, 3 # 2 = 0.

Step 2: Perform the addition operation (+) between 5 and the result from Step 1.
5 + 0 = 5.

Therefore, the answer is 5."

|6| = 6, and its prime factorization is 2 * 3.

We count the shared prime factors, which is 2 (the numbers 2 and 3). So, 6 # 6 = 2.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt3_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the PEFMDASC order of operations, we will first calculate the prime factor count.

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Starting with 4 and 3, we need to determine the count of shared prime factors.
The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
The prime factors of 3 are 3.
There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3.
So, 4 # 3 = 0.

Step 2: Addition (A)
Now, we can add the result of the prime factor count (0) to 2.
0 + 2 = 2.

The answer is 2."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.
