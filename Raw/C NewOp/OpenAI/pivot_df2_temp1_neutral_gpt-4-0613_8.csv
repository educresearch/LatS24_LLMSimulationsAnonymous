gpt-4-0613,1,4 # 3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to apply the newly updated order of operations.

Firstly, we need to solve the Prime Factor Counting operation (F), since it is ahead of addition (A) in the PEFMDASC list.
4 has two factors: 2 and 2.
3 has one prime factor: 3.
There are no shared prime factors. 

Therefore, 4 # 3 = 0.

Then, we evaluate 0 + 2 = 2.

So, the answer is 2.","GPT Response: 4 # 3 is counting the number of unique prime factors shared by absolute values of 4 and 3. The prime factor of 4 is 2 and the prime factor of 3 is 3. There are no shared prime factors, so 4 # 3 = 0.

So, the expression becomes 0 + 2.

Adding 0 + 2 equals 2.

Therefore, the answer to the given mathematical problem is 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: First, we apply the updated order of operations. According to the new order, Prime Factor Counting (F) is ahead of addition (A).

For 4 and 3, the prime factors are 2 and 3, respectively. There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3. Therefore, 4 # 3 equals 0. 

So, 4 # 3 + 2 becomes 0 + 2.

Finally, we add them up with the addition operation. 

0 + 2 = 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: The PEFMDASC order requires us to compute prime factor counting (F) before the addition. So let's start there.

The number 4 has prime factors 2, and the number 3 has the prime factor 3. Since these numbers do not share a prime factor, the prime factor count operation (4 # 3) results in 0.

So, 4 # 3 + 2 now becomes 0 + 2.

Then we proceed to the addition (A), 0 + 2 = 2.

So, the answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 2 @ 4,"GPT Response: Using the new operations and order of operations:

Step 1: Apply addition before concatenation.

5 + 2 = 7

Now the equation is 7 @ 4.

Step 2: Apply concatenation.

7 @ 4 = 74

So the answer is 74.","GPT Response: Following the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), this problem should be handled step-by-step.

Here, the problem involves addition (A) and concatenation (C).

According to the order of operations, addition should be done before concatenation. So, we will do 5 + 2 first and then perform the concatenation operation.

Step 1: Addition
5 + 2 = 7

Step 2: Concatenation
7 @ 4 = 74

So, the final answer is 74. 

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: Based on the newly updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to execute addition before concatenation. Thus, for this problem:

5 + 2 @ 4 
= 5 + 2 = 7 (since we need to evaluate addition before concatenation)
= 7 @ 4
= 74 (since we now need to perform the concatenation operation)

So, The answer is 74.","GPT Response: The PEFMDASC order requires us to perform operations in this order:
P: Parentheses
E: Exponents
F: Prime Factor counting
M/D: Multiplication and Division (left to right)
A/S: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
C: Concatenation (left to right)

For the given operation 5 + 2 @ 4, the order of operations will be as follows:

First Step: Perform Addition (A)
As the only operations here are addition and concatenation and addition comes before Concatenation in PEFMDASC, we first perform the addition operation. 
The calculation changes as follows: 
5 + 2 @ 4 = 7 @ 4

Second Step: Perform Concatenation (C)
After the addition operation, we move on to the next operation in the sequence: Concatenation. 
The calculation is now:
7 @ 4 = 74

gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to apply the newly updated order of operations.

Firstly, we need to perform the Prime Factor Counting operation (F), since it is ahead of addition (A) in the PEFMDASC list.
To do Prime Factor Counting operation, we find the prime factors of 3 and 2 separately. 

Prime factors of 3 are 3 and prime factors of 2 is 2, 

There are no common prime factors, so 3 # 2 = 0.

Next, we substitute above result into 5 + 3 # 2.

The given problem now becomes 5 + 0,

which equals to 5.

Therefore, the final answer to the problem is 5. So, we can say:

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: Following the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), the first operation to execute would be Prime Factor Counting (F).

# operation:
3 # 2 means count the number of unique prime factors that 3 and 2 have in common. Factors of 3 are 3 and that of 2 is 2. So, the result is 0 because they have no common prime factor.

This simplifies our equation to:
5 + 0 = 5

Therefore, the answer is 5.","GPT Response: Based on the newly introduced operation Prime Factor Counting (F) and the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we'll follow these steps to solve the problem:

First, look at the Prime Factor Counting operation. In the expression 3 # 2, the operation counts the number of unique prime factors common to |3| and |2|.

Numbers 3 and 2 are both prime numbers, meaning that they have no shared prime factors. Therefore, 3 # 2 equals 0.

Now, the original problem simplifies to:

5 + 0

Adding these together gives us:

5 + 0 = 5

So, The answer is 5.","GPT Response: The PEFMDASC order requires us to compute prime factor counting (F) before the addition. So let's start there.

The '#', or prime factor counting operation, works by counting how many unique prime factors two numbers share.
There are two numbers involved in this operation: '3' and '2'. 

The prime factors of 3 are 3 itself (since 3 is a prime number), and the prime factors of 2 are 2 itself (since 2 is also a prime number).
Since they don't share any prime factors, 3 # 2 = 0.

So, our original problem, 5 + 3 # 2, simplifies to 5 + 0.

Carrying out this operation gives us:

5 + 0 = 5

The answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3,"GPT Response: First, the operation inside the parentheses should be solved following the PEMDAS order.
So, 14 + 4 is 18. We replace the operation in the parentheses in the original equation. 
Now the equation becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we perform the prime factor counting operation (designated by the symbol '#'). The prime factor of 2 is 2 and the prime factor of 3 is 3. As these aren't the same, the prime factor counting operation gives us 0. Substitute this into the equation.
Now the equation becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Addition and subtraction are done from left to right according to the PEFMDASC order.
Now finishing the addition and subtraction, 18 + 12 = 30, and 30 - 0 = 30.
Now the equation simplifies to : 6 @ 30

Finally, we do the concatenation operation (designated by the symbol '@').
So, 6 @ 30 is 630.
Therefore,

The answer is 630.","GPT Response: Based on the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we will solve this problem step by step:

First, solve whatâ€™s within the parentheses:
=  6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
=  6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, perform the Prime Factor Counting (F):
=  6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 
(where 2 is the only common prime factor between 2 and 3, hence the result is 1)

Now perform Addition:
= 6 @ 18 + 11
= 6 @ 29

Finally perform Concatenation (C):
= 629

Therefore, 

The answer is 629.","GPT Response: Given the problem is 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3. We solve this by following the Updated Order of Operations: PEFMDASC,

Step 1. Solve the operation in Parentheses (P).
14 + 4 = 18
So, the problem now is 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3.

Step 2. Solve the Exponent (E)
There are no exponents in the problem.

Step 3. Prime Factor Counting (F)
2 # 3 = 1
(because both 2 and 3 are prime numbers, but no shared prime factors between them)
So, the problem now is 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1.

Step 4. Perform any Multiplication and Division from left to right (MD)
There is no multiplication and division in the problem.

Step 5. Perform any Addition and Subtraction from left to right (AS).
18 + 12 - 1 = 29
So, the problem now is 6 @ 29.

Step 6. Then, Concatenation (C)
6 @ 29 = 629

So, the solution to the problem 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 is 629.

The answer is 629.","GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step following PEFMDASC order of operations.

Problem: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1: Parentheses
First, we look for expressions in parentheses.
We have (14 + 4).

14 + 4 = 18.

Now, substitute this value back into the expression. Our expression now looks like this: 

=> 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Next, involve any prime factor counting operations.
Here, we have 2 # 3.

Since prime factors of 2 is 2 and prime factors of 3 is 3, and there are no shared prime factors, thus 2 # 3 = 0. 

Substitute this value back into the expression:

=> 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction 
Then, we handle any addition and subtraction from left to right.
We have 18 + 12 = 30.

Next we need to substitute this value back into the expression:

=> 6 @ 30 - 0

And then 30 - 0 = 30.

Update the expression with this value:

=> 6 @ 30

Step 4: Concatenation (C)
Finally, we arrive at the concatenation operation.
6 @ 30 = 630

Therefore, The answer is 630."
gpt-4-0613,1,8 # 2 + 6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we follow the PEFMDASC order of operations.

In the expression ""8 # 2 + 6 # 6"", we first handle the prime factor counting operations due to PEFMDASC.
8 has prime factors of 2, and 2 itself is a prime number, so they share 1 prime factor. Thus, 8 # 2 equals 1.
6 has prime factors 2 and 3, and itself has prime factors 2 and 3, therefore, they share two prime factors.  Therefore, 6 # 6 equals 2.

So, the given expression now becomes: ""1 + 2"".

Lastly, we perform the remaining addition:
1 + 2 equals 3.

Thus, The answer is 3.","GPT Response: To solve the problem according to the newly updated order of operations, we first need to resolve the Prime Factor Counting (#) first because F (prime factor count) comes before A (addition) in the order of operations.

8 # 2 
The prime factor of 8 is 2 and the prime factor of 2 is 2. Hence, they have 1 unique prime factor in common. Therefore, 8 # 2 = 1.

6 # 6
The prime factor of 6 is 2 and 3, but since we are comparing with same number 6, the number of unique shared prime factor is basically the unique prime factors of 6. Hence, they have 2 unique prime factors in common. Therefore, 6 # 6 = 2.

Now that we know 8 # 2 = 1 and 6 # 6 = 2, we can proceed to the next operation, which is addition (+).

1 + 2 = 3

Hence the answer to the problem 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 is 3 according to the PEFMDASC order of operations. Therefore,

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: To solve the problem 8 # 2 + 6 # 6, let's follow the updated Order of Operations (PEFMDASC) rule:

1. First, we do the prime factor counting (F):

The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. So 8 # 2 = 1 (since there is only one shared prime factor, which is 2). 

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the other 6's prime factors also are 2 and 3. So 6 # 6 = 2 (since there are two shared prime factors, 2 and 3).

This lets us rewrite the problem like this:

1 + 2

2. Next, we perform the addition (A):

1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Let's solve the problem 8 # 2 + 6 # 6. According to the order PEFMDASC, we need to do the Prime Factor counting operation first, before the addition.

First, 

   evaluate 8 # 2:
   
   The prime factors of 8 are 2, while the prime factors of 2 are also 2. Since they share one unique prime factor (which is 2), 8 # 2 = 1.

So, we rewrite the equation: 1 + 6 # 6

Second, 

   evaluate 6 # 6:
   
   Since 6 is a perfect match with itself, it shares all its prime factors with itself. The prime numbers in 6 are 2 and 3. Therefore, there are two unique prime factors, so 6 # 6 = 2.

Substituting this back into the equation, we get 1 + 2
Finally, we calculate the sum. 

1 + 2 = 3

Therefore, 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 evaluates to 3. 

The answer is 3."
