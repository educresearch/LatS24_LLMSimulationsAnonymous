gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: According to the new convention with operations, the new operation of concatenation (C) is done last. So, we need to carry out the basic operation of addition (A) first.

So, we first evaluate 5 + 2 = 7.

Then, we carry out the concatenation operation @:

So we get 7 @ 4, which means we join 7 and 4 at a digit level, to get 74. 

Therefore, the answer to the given mathematics problem with the new order of operations PEFMDASC is 74.

The answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: Here, the operations in the given problem are prime factor counting (#) and addition (+). Following the new PEFMDASC order of operations, it is noticeable that prime factor counting (F) comes before addition or subtraction (A), hence the # operation should be done first. 

Now, considering each number's prime factors:
1. Prime factors of 8 = 2
2. Prime factors of 2 = 2
3. Prime factors of 6 = 2 and 3

Therefore, we can rewrite the problem as:
1 * 1 + 2 (since both 8 and 2 share a same prime factor, which is 2. And 6 has two prime factors: 2 and 3, but only 2 is shared with 6 itself)

Following the order of operations, do the addition last:

= 1 + 2
= 3

So the final answer is 3. 

The answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: Let's first break down the operations in the given problem and then follow the order of operation PEFMDASC.

Here is the given problem: 

4 # 3 + 2

The first thing is to evaluate prime factorization counting operation (#):

Prime factors of 4 are {2}. Prime factors of 3 are {3}. They have no common factors. Therefore 4 # 3 = 0.

So, the equation becomes:

0 + 2

Next, comes Addition per the new rule order. So we add 0 and 2 

which gives us 2.

Finally, the answer to given problem is 2.

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: First, we need to perform the operation in the parenthesis:

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 

Second, we follow the order of operation for the prime factor counting operation: 

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3 
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (because the only shared prime factor between 2 and 3 is 2)

Next, we proceed to the addition operation: 

6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 
= 6 @ 30 - 1 

Then, we perform the subtraction operation:

6 @ 30 - 1 
= 6 @ 29 

Lastly, we do the concatenation operation:

6 @ 29 
= 629 

Therefore, the final answer is 629. 

The answer is 629."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: Let's first break down the operations in the given problem and identify the order of operations as per the new rules:

5 + 3 # 2

Here, 3 # 2 represents the Prime Factor Counting operation. 

Prime factors of |3| are 3, and prime factors of |2| are 2. Since there are no common prime factors between 3 and 2, 3 # 2 = 0. 

Now substituting this back to the original equation, we get:

5 + 0 

The addition operation gives: 5 + 0 = 5.

So, based on the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), 

The answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), addition should be performed before concatenation. So, the given expression is solved in the following manner:

5 + 2@4
= 7@4 (since we need to evaluate addition before concatenation)
= 74

Therefore, the answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we'll first apply the Prime Factor Counting operation, since it takes precedence over Addition according to the new order of operations, PEFMDASC.

Prime factorisation of 8 is 2, and of 2 is 2, which gives us one shared prime factor. Hence,

8 # 2 = 1

Next;

Prime factorisation of 6 is 2 and 3, then there is one shared prime factor with 6. Hence,

6 # 6 = 1

Now, we can apply Addition, resulting in

1 + 1 = 2

Therefore, the answer to the given Mathematics problem is 2.

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, it's necessary to evaluate the unique prime factors shared by 4 and 3, using the Prime Factor counting (F) operation. The prime factors of 4 are {2} and the prime factors of 3 are {3}. They share no prime factors, so 4#3 = 0.

Then, take the result of 4#3 and add with 2 using the addition operation. 

So our expression simplifies as:

0 + 2 = 2

So, the final answer is 2.

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: According to PEFMDASC, the first thing to do is resolve the parentheses:

6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Next, we check if there's any exponentiation operation. No, there isn't.

After that, we need to do Prime Factor counting:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 (since prime factors of 2 are 2 and prime factors of 3 are 3, i.e., there are no shared prime factors)

Now, onto Multiplication and Division. There is none.

Then, Addition and Subtraction:

6 @ 18 + 12 - 1 
= 6 @ 18 + 11 
= 6 @ 29 (perform the addition operation first)

Finally, we perform Concatenation:

6 @ 29 
= 629

The answer is 629."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: In this mathematics problem, we are given the expression 5 + 3 # 2, and we need to compute this expression using the new order of operations, PEFMDASC.

Step 1: Parentheses - There are no parentheses in the expression.
Step 2: Exponents - The expression does not contain any exponents.
Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F) - The expression does involve the prime factor counting operation. Here, we need to evaluate 3 # 2. Here it is noticeable that 3 and 2 are both prime, and they don't share any prime factors. As such, 3 # 2 = 0.
So, the expression becomes 5 + 0 = 5.

There are no multiplication and division (M/D) operations, addition and subtraction (A/S) operations, and concatenation (C) in the resulting expression.

Therefore, 

The answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: Based on the PEFMDASC order of operations, the steps to solving 5 + 2@4 would be as follows:

1. Addition is evaluated before Concatenation according to the updated order, therefore we add 5 and 2 together:

   5 + 2 = 7 

2. Then we perform concatenation (7@4):

    7 @ 4 = 74

Therefore, the answer is 74."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we start with the Prime Factor Counting operation since it comes before Addition according to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC):

8 # 2 = 1 (since the unique prime factor common to both numbers is 2)

6 # 6 = 1 (since 6 and 6 both share the prime factor of 2, 3)

So, the equation becomes: 

1 + 1 = 2

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: The given Mathematics problem is 4#3 + 2.

To solve this, we follow the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC). 
First, we need to evaluate Prime Factor Counting, denoted as #.

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and the prime factors of 3 are 3. So 4#3 = 0 (since there are no common prime factors)

Afterward, we can now do the addition operation. Giving us:

0 + 2 = 2

The answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Firstly, we need to resolve the operation within the brackets using the rule of 'Parentheses'. 

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2#3 
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3 

Next, according to the order 'PEFMDASC', we perform prime factor counting. The shared prime factors between 2 and 3 is none, therefore 2#3 is 0.

= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0 

Then, we move to the next operation which is addition.

= 6 @ 18 + 12 
= 6 @ 30

Finally, we perform the last operation which is concatenation.

= 630

So the solution to the given Mathematics problem based on the updated order of operations is 630.

The answer is 630."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: First, follow the order of operation PEFMDASC.

Here, we have addition and prime factor counting. According to the updated order of operations, prime factor counting should be evaluated before addition.

Prime factor counting # for 3 and 2 is:
Prime factors of 3 are 3. Prime factors of 2 are 2. They do not share any prime factor so 3 # 2 = 0

If we substitute that into the equation we have:

5 + 0 = 5 

The answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 2@4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we follow the PEFMDASC order of operations which goes as Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division (left to right), Addition and Subtraction (left to right), and Concatenation (left to right).

Here's how we would evaluate the expression:

Given:

5 + 2 @ 4

There are no Parentheses, Exponents, or Prime Factor counts to evaluate first according to the PEFMDASC order of operations.

We come to Addition next. However, since Concatenation has to be performed last, we do not perform Addition here yet.

So, the next operation would be Concatenation:
2 @ 4 = 24

This transforms our expression to:

5 + 24

Now, since there is no Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting, Multiplication and Division left, we move directly to Addition. 

Finally, do the Addition:

5 + 24 = 29

So, the result of ""5 + 2 @ 4"" according to the PEFMDASC order of operations is 29.

Therefore, the answer is 29."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,8 # 2+6 # 6,"GPT Response: Let's solve it step by step using revised order of operations (PEFMDASC):

Initial Problem: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6

Step 1 (Prime Factor counting (F)): 
The prime factor of 8 is 2. The prime factor of 2 is also 2. Therefore, they share 1 prime factor.
The prime factor of 6 is 2 and 3. So, the prime factors shared by 6 and 6 are 2 and 3, thus, there are 2 shared prime factors.

This gives us:
1 + 2

Step 2 (Addition (A)): 
1 + 2 = 3

So, the answer is 3."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4#3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we follow the PEFMDASC order of operations which goes as Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division (left to right), Addition and Subtraction (left to right), and Concatenation (left to right).

Here's how we would solve the problem:

Start:

Problem: 4#3 + 2

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (F) 

4 and 3 are both prime numbers. But they are different prime numbers. So, they have no shared prime factors. 

So, 4#3 = 0

This changes the problem to: 

Problem: 0 + 2

Step 2: Addition (A)

Now, simply add the results above:
0 + 2 = 2 

So the answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3,"GPT Response: Given expression: 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3

Step 1 (Parentheses): 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3 
Closely following the revised order of operations (PEFMDASC), the calculation to be performed inside the parentheses comes first. Thus, (14 + 4) is evaluated as 18.

Step 2 (Prime Factor Counting): 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1
Next, the prime factor counting operation (F) comes prior to the other remaining operations. The numbers 2 and 3 have only one common prime factor, 2. Hence, 2#3 results in 1.

Step 3 (Addition): 6 @ 18 + 11
Next, in the remaining operations, addition and subtraction are of the same precedence and performed from left to right. So, we perform 12 - 1 as 11.

Step 4 (Concatenation): 618 + 11
The final operation is concatenation (C), and according to the guiding principle, |6| @ |18| equals 618.

Step 5 (Addition): 629
Lastly, the remaining operation to be performed is the addition of 618 + 11, which results in 629.

The answer is 629."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+3 # 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we follow the PEFMDASC order of operations which goes as Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor counting, Multiplication and Division (left to right), Addition and Subtraction (left to right), and Concatenation (left to right).

Here's how we would solve the problem:

Given:

5 + 3 # 2

The operation in the given expression is addition and prime factor counting. According to the PEFMDASC order of operations, we will first calculate the prime factor counting before we perform the addition.

Prime Factor counting (F):

3 # 2 means we have to find the count of unique prime factors shared between 3 and 2. 

The prime factor of 3 is 3 and the prime factor of 2 is 2. 

There are no shared prime factors, so 3 # 2 equals 0.

Now our expression looks like this:

5 + 0

Now we perform addition (A):

5 + 0 = 5

So, the answer is 5."
