Problem: 5 + 2 @ 4 

Here, we have one operation which is addition (+), and another which is concatenation (@). According to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), addition (+) should be evaluated before concatenation (@). 

So, we first add: 5 + 2 = 7. Now, we substitute this in the original equation.

Let's simplify: 7 @ 4 

The @ operation concatenates the numbers as per the rules. Therefore, 7 @ 4 becomes 74. 

So, the answer to the problem 5 + 2 @ 4 as per the new order of operations and rules will be 74.

The answer is 74."

We know that:
- Prime factors of 8 are 2.
- Prime factors of 2 are 2.
- Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.

Now, using the Prime Factor Counting operation (F), we have to find shared prime factors:

For 8 # 2, the shared prime factor is 2. So, 8 # 2 = 1.

Similarly, for 6 # 6, as they are the same number their shared prime factors will also be the same (both 2 and 3 are shared prime factors). So, 6 # 6 = 2.

Now substituting back to the given expression, we will have:
8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 2.

Now we move to the next operation according to the order which is 'F' - prime factor counting:

systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

Step 1: Start with the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation since F comes before A in PEFMDASC:
       For a = 4, the prime factors are {2}
       For b = 3, the prime factor is {3}
       There are no shared prime factors between 4 and 3, so 4 # 3 = 0

The equation now looks like this: 0 + 2

systemPrompt3_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we must follow the order of operations. The updated order of operations prioritized as Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction, and Concatenation.

An initial glance at the problem shows it contains parentheses, prime factor counting, addition, subtraction, and concatenation. Let's break down the steps:

Initial Mathematical Problem: 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 1 - Parentheses (P):
Inside the parentheses, we have 14 + 4, which equals 18.
So our equation now is: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2 - Prime Factor Counting (F):
Next operation to handle is Prime Factor Counting, denoted by #. To simplify 2 # 3, we're checking for common prime factors. The prime factor of 2 is 2, and the prime factor of 3 is 3, so they have no prime factors in common. This equals 0.
So our equation now is: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3 - Addition and Subtraction (A/S):
Within this step, we perform the operations from left to right. First, we address the addition, 18 + 12 = 30. After this, we address subtraction, 30 - 0 = 30.
So our equation now is: 6 @ 30

Step 4 - Concatenation (C):
Finally, we'll use the Concatenation operation. Concatenation joins the digits together, in this case, 6 and 30 become 630.

Hence, based on the newly updated order of operations: 

The answer is 630."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:

                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1.

According to PEFMDASC, we have to first take care of Prime Factor counting (F) which comes before addition (A). 

Let's begin with prime factor counting:

(a) 8 # 2: 
Here we are looking for shared prime factors of numbers 8 and 2. 
The prime factors of 8 are 2 (2 * 2 * 2), and for 2, it's just 2.
The shared prime factor here is 2. Therefore, 8 # 2 equals 1.

(b) 6 # 6: 
Normally, a number will share all its prime factors with itself. 
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. So, 6 # 6 is equals to 2 (as there are two unique prime factors).

Now we substitute these back into the expression: 1 (from 8 # 2) + 2 (from 6 # 6).

Following the order, the next operation is addition. So, we add these two values: 1 + 2 = 3.

                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

Step 1: Parenthesis (P): Resolve the operations inside the parentheses first.
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F): Next, resolve the Prime Factor Counting operation.
The unique prime numbers for 2 are [2], and for 3 are [3]. They have no common prime factors.
So, 2 # 3 = 0
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Resolve the addition and subtraction from left to right.
= 6 @ 18 + 12
= 6 @ 30

Step 4: Concatenation (C): Finally, resolve the Concatenation operation.
