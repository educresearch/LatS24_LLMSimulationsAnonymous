systemPrompt1_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: The problem is:
6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3

First, we evaluate the part in parenthesis (Because Parentheses comes first in order operations)
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we follow the order of operations to perform the prime factor counting operation before addition or subtraction:
Since 2 and 3 both have one prime factor which is 2 in common
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 1

Next, considering the order of operations, we do the addition before concatenation:
= 6 @ 30 - 1

We then perform the concatenation operation:
= 630 - 1

Finally, we perform the subtraction operation:
= 629 

The answer is 629."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

Given, 5 + 3 # 2 

First, apply the Prime Factor Counting operation:

Observe that 2 is the only prime factor of 2 and 3 does not have any prime factors (as it's a prime number). Hence, they do not share any prime factors.

So, 3 # 2 = 0

Substituting this result back into the equation, we get:

Now we proceed with the Addition operation:

Firstly, applying the Prime Factor Counting Operation (F):
4 # 3 denotes the number of unique prime factors shared by 4 and 3. The prime factors of 4 are 2 (and 2), and the prime factors of 3 is 3. As there are no shared prime factors, 4 # 3 = 0.

So the expression becomes 0 + 2.

Next applying the addition operation (A):
0 + 2 = 2.

Hence, the answer to the problem 4 # 3 + 2 with the new order of operations is 2.

So, the operation 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3 becomes 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3.

Next, the prime factor counting is calculated: 2 # 3 = 0, as 2 and 3 are both prime numbers but they do not share any prime factors.

Thus, the equation is now 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0.

Then, the concatenation is performed: 6 @ 18 = 618.

Therefore, the equation becomes 618 + 12 - 0.

Then, follow the standard order of operations: addition before subtraction. First, add 618 and 12 to get 630.

systemPrompt3_userPrompt2_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Given the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6, we need to follow the PEFMDASC order to get the answer. 

First off, we apply the Prime Factor Counting operation on the two expressions 8 # 2 and 6 # 6.

(1) For 8 # 2:
The prime factors of 8 are 2, hence unique prime factors is 1.
The prime factor of 2 is 2.
Since they share 1 unique prime factor (2), 8 # 2 equals 1.

(2) For 6 # 6:
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, hence unique prime factors is 2, 3.
Since 6 and 6 are the same number, They share both unique prime factors (2 and 3), so 6 # 6 equals 2.

So, now our expression becomes 1 + 2.

Adding these two, we get the answer 3.

The answer is 3."

Observe that:

Prime factors of 3: 3
Prime factors of 2: 2 

There are no common prime factors between 3 and 2.

Hence, 3 # 2 = 0. 

So, the expression becomes 5 + 0.

Lastly, following the normal rules of addition:

Given expression: 5 + 2 @ 4

According to the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we don't have to evaluate parentheses (P), exponents (E), or prime factor counting (F). 

So, we move on to M/D: Multiplication and Division, of which we have none.

Next, we go to A/S: Addition and Subtraction. In the given expression, we have an addition operation: 5 + 2 = 7. 

So the expression becomes: 7 @ 4

Finally, we do the last operation, C: Concatenation, which joins the digits of 7 and 4 together.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to use the revised order of operations PEFMDASC.

Step 1: Parentheses
The first term that needs to be resolved is within the parenthesis: (14 + 4)
14 + 4 = 18

So the expression after this step becomes: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting
The next operation to be performed according to PEFMDASC is prime factor counting: 2 # 3
2 and 3 are both prime numbers but they are not the same number. Hence, they don't share any common prime factors. So, 2 # 3 = 0 

Now our expression looks like: 6 @ 18 + 12 - 0

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction
According to our new order of operations, addition and subtraction should be performed next. Here we have both: 18 + 12 - 0

First we do 18 + 12 = 30 and then subtract the resultant from 0 so our operation becomes: 30 - 0 = 30

So, now our expression becomes: 6 @ 30

Step 4: Concatenation
The final operation remaining as per PEFMDASC is concatenation: 6 @ 30
Perform the operation joining the digits together.

So, 6 @ 30 = 630.

To summarize:

The solution for the expression 6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3, based on the new rules, is 630. 

The answer is 630."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

Given expression: 5 + 3 # 2

According to the new order of operations PEFMDASC, we know that prime factor counting (F) takes precedence over addition (A), so we perform the operation 3 # 2 first.

To do this, we need to calculate the count of unique prime factors shared between |3| and |2|. 

The prime factor of 3 is 3, and the prime factor of 2 is 2, and hence they do not share any common prime factors. Therefore, 3 # 2 = 0.

Now our expression becomes: 5 + 0

5 + 0 = 5.
