First, we start with the parentheses (P), but there are no parentheses in the expression.

Next, we move to exponents (E), but there are no exponents in the expression.

Then, we move to prime factor counting (F). Again, there are no prime factor counting operations in the expression.

After that, we move to multiplication and division (M and D) from left to right. But there are no multiplication or division operations in the expression.

Then, we move to addition and subtraction (A and S) from left to right. In this case, we have 5 + 2, which equals 7.

Finally, we move to concatenation (C) from left to right. We have 7 @ 4, which means we need to join the digits together. Thus, it becomes 74.

Therefore, the final answer is ""The answer is 74."""

                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2)

                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

First, we evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation: 3#2. The prime factors of 3 are 3 itself, and the prime factors of 2 is 2. Since there are no shared prime factors between 3 and 2, the result is 0.

Now, we can simplify the expression: 5 + 0. Since there is no concatenation (C) or any other operations involved, we can perform the addition (A) operation, which gives us 5.

Therefore, the final answer is ""The answer is 5."""

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.
                    It's crucial to get this right for accurate calculations.
                    
                    Revised Order of Operations: PEFMDASC
                    P: Parentheses
                    E: Exponents

                    (ii) 5 # 3 + 6
                    = 0 + 6 (since we need to evaluate prime factorization before addition)
                    = 6

                    (iii) 5 - 3 @ 6
                    = 2 @ 6 (since we need to evaluate subtraction before concatenation)
                    = 26

                    (iv) 5 - 3 # 6
                    = 5 - 1 (since we need to evaluate prime factorization before subtraction)

                    (vi) (3 + 10 # 2) * 5 @ 42 
                    = (3 + 1) * 5 @ 42 (we need to evaluate what is in the parenthesis first and prime factor counting is before addition)
                    = 4 * 5 @ 42  (we need to evaluate multiplication before concatenation
                    = 20 @ 42 = 2042. (concatenation is last)
                    
                    Negative Prompts:
                    * Do Not assume traditional order of operations (PEMDAS); use the updated PEFMDASC instead.
                    * Avoid skipping steps or assuming familiarity with the new operations.
                    * Do Not generalize or use examples not directly related to the given operations and expressions.

Step 1: Evaluate the addition inside the parentheses.
6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3
= 6@18 + 12-2  #  3

Step 2: Evaluate the concatenation operation.
6@18 + 12-2  #  3
= 618 + 12-2  #  3

Step 3: Evaluate the prime factor counting operation.
618 + 12-2  #  3
= 1 + 12-2  #  3
(Since there are no shared prime factors between 6 and 18, the result is 0.)

Step 4: Evaluate the remaining addition and subtraction.
1 + 12-2  #  3
= 1 + 10  #  3
= 11  #  3

Step 5: Evaluate the prime factor counting operation between the result and 3.
11  #  3
(Since there are no shared prime factors between 11 and 3, the result is 0.)

The answer is 0."
