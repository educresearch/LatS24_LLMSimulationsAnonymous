Now, the '#' symbol represents the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation, and the updated order of operations tells us to perform Prime Factor Counting before addition (A).\n\nFirst, we need to find the prime factors of the numbers involved. The prime factors of 8 are 2, which is repeated thrice. For 2, the only prime factor is 2 itself. For 6, the prime factors are 2 and 3.\n\nWe then use the Prime Factor Counting operation to find out how many unique prime factors the sets of numbers share.\n\n8 # 2 = 1 (since the only prime factor of 2, which is 2, is also a prime factor of 8)\n\n6 # 6 = 1 (since 6 shares all of its prime factors with itself, but considering unique ones we get 1 as result)\n\nAfter having computed these values, we can substitute back into the original equation:\n\n8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt2_userPrompt3_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400", "model": "gpt-4-0613", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 400, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "Introduction of New Mathematical Operations and Updated Order of Operations\n                    Mathematics has recently introduced two novel operations:\n\n                    Concatenation (C): This operation, denoted as a @ b, represents the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. \n                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):\n                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.\n                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.\n                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.\n                    \n                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Represented as a # b, this operation counts the number of unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of a and b. \n                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):\n                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1\n                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) \n                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. \n                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)\n                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. \n                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)\n                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.\n                    \n                    The order of operations has been revised to PEFMDASC, representing:\n\n                    P: Parentheses\n                    E: Exponents\n                    F: Prime Factor counting\n                    M/D: Multiplication and Division (left to right)\n                    A/S: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)\n                    C: Concatenation (left to right)\n                    \n                    Important Examples Demonstrating New Operations and Order:\n                    (i) 5 @ 3 + 6\n                    = 5 @ 9 (since we need to evaluate addition before concatenation)\n                    = 59\n\n                    (ii) 5 # 3 + 6\n                    = 0 + 6 (since we need to evaluate prime factorization before addition)\n                    = 6\n\n                    (iii) 5 - 3 @ 6\n                    = 2 @ 6 (since we need to evaluate subtraction before concatenation)\n                    = 26\n\n                    (iv) 5 - 3 # 6\n                    = 5 - 1 (since we need to evaluate prime factorization before subtraction)\n                    = 4\n\n                    (vi) (3 + 10 # 2) * 5 @ 42 \n                    = (3 + 1) * 5 @ 42 (we need to evaluate what is in the parenthesis first and prime factor counting is before addition)\n                    = 4 * 5 @ 42  (we need to evaluate multiplication before concatenation\n                    = 20 @ 42 = 2042.
