Step 1: Parentheses
In the given expression, we have (14+4) inside parentheses. So, we need to evaluate this first. 
14 + 4 = 18

After evaluating the parentheses, the expression becomes:
6 @ 18 + 12 - 2#3

Step 1: Prime Factor counting
We first evaluate the prime factor counting operation: 8 # 2 and 6 # 6.
- The prime factors of 8 are 2 and 2 (2^3), and the prime factors of 2 are 2.
- The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
So, 8 # 2 = 1 and 6 # 6 = 2.

Step 2: Addition
Next, we perform the addition operation: 2 + 6.
2 + 6 = 8.

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 1 + 2 + 8 (since prime factor counting is evaluated before addition)
