gpt-4-0613,1,4 # 3+2,"GPT Response: First, we focus on the prime factor counting operation (#). The prime factors of 4 are {2}, and the prime factors of 3 are {3}. Therefore, 4 # 3 = 0 because there is no shared prime factor.

The initial expression 4 # 3 + 2 is now reduced to 0 + 2. According to the order of operations (PEFMDASC), the addition operation comes next. 0 + 2 equals 2.

Hence, the answer to the problem 4 # 3 + 2, according to the newly updated order of operations, is 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: First, we have to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation. 

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and those of 3 are 3. Therefore, 4 and 3 do not have any shared prime factors and 4 # 3 would be 0.

So, the expression becomes 0 + 2.

After addition, the expression becomes: 0 + 2 = 2.

The final answer is, therefore: 

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: First, we utilize Prime Factor Counting for the expression 4 # 3. Considering that the prime factors of 4 are 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3, there is no shared factor. Therefore, 4 # 3 equals to 0.

Now, we have 0 + 2

Calculating addition gives 2.

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: To evaluate 4 # 3 + 2, we have to follow the PEFMDASC order of operations. Based on the new operations, # is our Prime Factor Counting operation and + is the traditional addition operation. Here, # comes before + in PEFMDASC. So, we need to apply the prime factor counting operation first then the addition operation.

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting (4 # 3)
Prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2. Prime factor of 3 is 3. There are no shared prime factors, so 4 # 3 = 0.

Now the expression becomes: 0 + 2.

Step 2: Addition (0 + 2)
Now, add the numbers: 0 + 2 = 2.

So, the answer is 2."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 3#2,"GPT Response: First, we focus on the prime factor counting operation (#). The prime factors of 3 are {3}, and the prime factors of 2 are {2}. Therefore, there are no common prime factors, so 3#2 equals 0.

The expression becomes 5 + 0. Evaluating the addition operation then gives 5.

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: First, we have to evaluate the prime factor counting operation (3#2), according to the updated order of operations. 

The prime factors of 3 are 3 and the prime factors of 2 are 2. They do not share any prime factor, so 3#2 = 0.

Then we are left with the equation 5 + 0, which equals 5.

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: First, we utilize Prime Factor Counting for the expression 3 # 2. Considering that the prime factors of 3 are 3, and the prime factors of 2 are 2, there is no shared factor. Therefore, 3 # 2 equals to 0.

The answer is 5.","GPT Response: To evaluate 5 + 3#2, we need to follow the new order of operations, PEFMDASC, which puts prime factor counting before addition.

(i) Prime Factor Counting (F): 3#2
The prime factors of 3 is 3 and for 2, it is 2. There are no shared prime factors, so, 3#2 = 0.

(ii) Addition (A): So, now the expression becomes 5 + 0

Performing the calculation, we get:
5 + 0 = 5

The answer is 5."
gpt-4-0613,1,5+2 @ 4,"GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we should carry out the Concatenation after the addition.

Firstly, carry out the addition operation:
5 + 2 = 7.

After that, carry out the Concatenation operation:
7 @ 4 = 74.

Therefore, the answer is 74.","GPT Response: According to the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we will first perform addition operation because A (Addition) comes before C (Concatenation) in this order.

So, 5+2 = 7.

Now we perform the concatenated operation ""@"" on the numbers 7 and 4.

7 @ 4 = 74.

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: We have to utilize the new Order of Operations: PEFMDASC. So, in the given problem, we use addition before concatenation.

Step 1: Perform Addition:
5 + 2 = 7;

Step 2: Now apply Concatenation:
7 @ 4 = 74.

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: To evaluate 5 + 2 @ 4, we have to follow the PEFMDASC order of operations. Based on the new order, we have to do addition (A) before concatenation (C). Here is how we proceed:

gpt-4-0613,1,6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3,"GPT Response: Applying the new order of operations as per PEFMDASC, we will first deal within the brackets denoted by the parentheses (P):

6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
= 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3  (since addition comes before concatenation.)

Next, we will handle the concatenation operator '@':

= 618 + 12 - 2 # 3  (since concatenation comes before addition and subtraction.)

Moving on, we perform the addition operation:

= 630 - 2 # 3  (since addition comes before subtraction.)

After that, under the new order of operations, prime factor (F) counting operation is performed before subtraction, but after addition,

= 630 - 1  (since 2 and 3 share only one prime factor, which is 2.)

Finally, we perform the subtraction operation:

= 629

Therefore, the solution to the problem 6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3 under the new order of operations is 629.

So,

The answer is 629.","GPT Response: Following the PEFMDASC order:

1. Evaluate Parentheses:
    6 @ (14 + 4) + 12 - 2 # 3
    = 6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3

2. Evaluate Addition/Subtraction:
    6 @ 18 + 12 - 2 # 3
    = 6 @ 18 + 10 # 3

3. Evaluate Prime Factor Counting:
    = 6 @ 18 + 10 # 3
    = 6 @ 18 + 0 
    (since the prime factors of 10 are 2 and 5 and of 3 is 3, there is no common prime factor)

4. Finally, Concatenation is performed:
    = 6 @ 18 + 0
    = 618 + 0
    = 618

Therefore, the solution to the mathematics problem is 618. 

So, The answer is 618.","GPT Response: First, let's apply the new order of operations specified PEFMDASC (Parentheses, Exponents, Prime Factor Counting, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction, Concatenation). Remember, the operations within the parentheses should be performed first.

The mathematical problem is:

6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3

Following PEFMDASC, do operations within parentheses first:

6@(18) + 12-2  #  3

Then apply concatenation (C):

618 + 12-2  #  3

After that, perform subtraction which is before Prime Counting according to the order:

630 - 2  #  3

Then, perform prime counting (F):

630 - 1 (as 2 and 3 both are prime numbers, but only 2 is a common prime)

Finally, perform subtraction.

The answer is 629.","GPT Response: According to the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to follow the steps as below:

Problem: 6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3

Step 1 [Parentheses (P) first]: 
We evaluate the parentheses first, which is (14+4). It gives 18.

6@18 + 12-2  #  3

Step 2 [Prime Factor Counting (F) before Addition/Subtraction (A/S)]:
The Prime Factor Counting operation (F) is indicated using the '#' symbol. In this problem, you have: 2 # 3. The prime factors for 2 are just 2, and for 3 are just 3. According to the definition, this operation counts the common unique prime factors between 2 and 3, which there are none. Therefore 2 # 3 = 0.

6@18 + 12-0

Step 3 [Addition/Subtraction (A/S) before Concatenation (C)]:
Now, we perform the Addition/Subtraction operation. We get:

6@18 + 12 = 6@18 + 12

Step 4 [Concatenation (C) last]: 
Finally we perform the Concatenation operation 6@18, which joins the two numbers ""6"" and ""18"" together.

618 + 12

Step 5 [Do the Addition/Subtraction (A/S)]:
We do the addition:

618 + 12 = 630

So the final answer is:

gpt-4-0613,1,8#2 + 6#6,"GPT Response: The problem: 8#2 + 6#6

Applying the new operations and order of operations (PEFMDASC), let's solve this step-by-step:

Step 1:
Evaluate Prime Factor counting operation (#):
8#2 = 1 (since 2 is the only shared prime factor of 8 and 2)
6#6 = 1 (since 6 shares all the prime factors with itself, 2 and 3)

So, the expression becomes 1 + 1

Step 2:
Next, we will evaluate the Addition operation (+):
1 + 1 = 2

So, The answer is 2.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we follow the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. Prime Factor Counting (F) comes first:
    - 8#2 = 1, because the only prime factor of 8 and 2 is 2.
    - 6#6 = 1, because the only prime factor of 6 is 2 and 3, and we only consider the unique factors.

2. Addition (A):
    - 1 + 1 = 2

Therefore the answer is:

The answer is 2.","GPT Response: The problem is: 8#2 + 6#6

According to the new operation PEFMDASC, the Prime Factor Counting (F) is performed before Addition (A), so we need to evaluate 8#2 and 6#6 first.

The prime factors of 8 are 2, and the prime factors of 2 are 2. Hence, 8#2 = 1

The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and hence 6#6 = 2

So, the expression becomes 1 + 2.

Finally, the expression is simplified to:

= 1 + 2
= 3

The answer is 3.","GPT Response: Step 1: Evaluate Prime Factor Counting (F)

First, we apply the 'F' operation or Prime Factor Counting operation. For 8#2, prime factors of 8 are 2, and prime factors of 2 also include 2. So, 8#2 = 1 (as they have 1 common prime factor, which is 2).

Similarly, for 6#6, prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, and prime factors of 6 (it's the same number) also include 2 and 3. Hence, 6#6 = 2 (as they have 2 common prime factors, which are 2 and 3).

Now, the expression becomes:

1 + 2

Step 2: Perform Addition:

1 + 2 = 3

So, the answer is 3."
