For this problem, we only need to consider Prime Factor Counting (F) and Addition (A), as there are no parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, subtraction, or concatenation involved.<br><br>First, we evaluate the Prime Factor Counting (F) operation:<br><br>1. 8#2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2, while the prime factors of 2 are just 2.

      <td>GPT Response: Let's proceed step-by-step using the PEFMDASC order of operations.<br><br>1. Prime Factor Counting (F) — We need to perform prime factor counting before addition. Let's calculate each component:<br>   - 8#2: The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2 (or 2^3), and the prime factor of 2 is 2. The shared prime factor is 2. So, 8#2 gives us 1 unique shared prime factor.<br>   - 6#6: The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Since both numbers we are comparing are the same, they share the same prime factors. So, here, we have 2 shared prime factors (2 and 3), but remember, we're looking for the count of unique prime factors, so the result is 2.<br><br>2. Addition (A) — Now, we add the results from the prime factor counting.<br>   - 1 (from 8#2) + 2 (from 6#6) = 3<br><br>3. The final answer is:<br>   The answer is 3.</td>
