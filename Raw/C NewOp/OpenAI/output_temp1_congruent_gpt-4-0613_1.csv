According to the order of operations (PEFMDASC), addition (A) comes before concatenation (C), so the addition operation must be evaluated first.

1. First, add 5 and 2 which equals to 7.

The given Mathematics problem is 6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3.

Step 1: Parentheses (P):
Simplify the operation inside the parentheses: 14 + 4 = 18. 
The problem now transforms to 6@18 + 12-2  #  3. 

Step 2: Exponents (E): 
There are no exponents in the problem, so nothing to do in this step.

Step 3: Prime Factor counting (F):
To perform the prime factor counting operation, we compute 12 - 2 # 3. Noting the prime factors of 10 (12-2) are 2 and 5, and for 3 it's just 3. There are no common factors, thus this operation equals 0.
The problem now transforms to: 6@18 + 0. 

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D): There are no multiplication or division operations present, so nothing to do in this step.

Step 5: Addition and subtraction (A/S): Compute the addition of 6@18 and 0, which simply gives us 6@18.  
The problem now transforms to: 6@18.

Step 6: Concatenation (C): Perform the concatenation operation to give: 618.

The answer is 618."
systemPrompt1_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,system,"There is a new development in mathematics convention involving operations and order of operations. 
                    Two new operations were defined:
                    1. (C) Concatenation operation: Define a @ b as the concatenation of the digits of |a| and |b|. This operation simply joins the numbers at a digit level.
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

                    2. (F) Prime Factor Counting operation: Define a # b as the count of unique prime factors shared by |a| and |b|.
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

                    The order of operations is now expanded from PEMDAS to PEFMDASC, i.e., 
                    1. (P) Parentheses
                    2. (E) Exponents
                    3. (F) Prime Factor counting
                    4. (M) Multiplication and (D) Division (L to R)
                    5. (A) Addition and (S) Subtraction (L to R)
                    6. (C) Concatenation (L to R)
                    i.e., parenthesis first, then exponents, then prime factor counting, then multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then concatenation.

                    Important Examples demonstrating new operations and order of operations:

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and the prime factors of 3 are 3 itself. So, there are no common prime factors between 4 and 3, making the result of this operation 0.

So, we have:

systemPrompt3_userPrompt2_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Given the problem: 8#2 + 6#6, the order of operations tells us to calculate prime factor counting (#) before addition (+).

- First, calculate for 8#2. The prime factors of 8 are 2 (2 x 2 x 2) and the prime factors of 2 is 2. They both share 1 prime factor, which is 2, hence 8#2 = 1.

So the problem now simplifies to: 1 + 6#6

- Then, calculate for 6#6. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, both are present two times, but since we're counting unique factors, hence 6#6 = 2.

So the problem now simplifies to: 1 + 2

- Finally, calculate for 1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3."

systemPrompt3_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: In the expression ""5 + 3#2"", we first apply the operation of prime factor counting (F) according to the updated order of operations ""PEFMDASC"". 

The prime factors of 3 are only 3 and for 2 it's only 2. So there's no common unique prime factor between them, thus 3#2 equals 0.

Hence, the expression becomes ""5 + 0"". 

Now, apply addition and we get ""5"".

The answer is 5."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together. 
                    Key Examples of Concatenation (C):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (c) If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.
                    
                    Prime Factor Counting (F): Denoted by a # b, it calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b. 
                    Key Examples of Prime Factor Counting (F):
                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1
                        (since prime factors of 12 is 2 and 3 and prime factors of 56 is 2 and 7, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 2) 
                    (b) if a = -16 (which is negative) and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1. 
                        (since prime factors of 16 is 2 and prime factors of 4 is 5, i.e., there is only 1 shared prime factor 5)
                    (c) if a = 7 and b = 5, then a # b = 7 # 5 =0. 
                        (since prime factor of 7 is 7 and prime factor of 5 is 5, i.e., there is no shared prime factor, i.e. 0.)
                    (d) Similar to (c), 1 # 7 = 0 and 0 # 1 = 0 since there are no shared prime factors between 1 and 7, or between 0 and 1.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Given equation is 6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3. Let's solve this by following the PEFMDASC order.

Begin with Parentheses which is P in the PEFMDASC. We need to resolve the operations within the parentheses first.

6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3
= 6@18 + 12-2  #  3

Now, according to PEFMDASC order, we next consider Prime Factor Counting (F). So let's calculate 2 # 3.

6@18 + 12-2  #  3
= 6@18 + 12-0 (While calculating 2 # 3, we find no shared unique prime factors between 2 and 3. Hence, it's 0.)

Move on to next step 'M' and 'D' in PEFMDASC. Operations of multiplication and division are done from left to right. Here, there are no multiplication or division operations. So, we move to the next step.

Next is 'A' and 'S'. According to PEFMDASC, we need to do addition and subtraction from left to right.

6@18 + 12-0
= 6@18 + 12
= 6@30

Finally, we've 'C' i.e., concatenation. Let's concatenate 6 with 30.

6@30
= 630

Hence, after applying the PEFMDASC order of operations:

6@(14+4) + 12-2  #  3 = 630.

Thus, the answer is 630."

                    The field of mathematics has expanded with the introduction of two new operations, and the order of operations has been accordingly updated.

                    New Operations:
                    Concatenation (C): Represented as a @ b, this operation joins the digits of |a| and |b| together.

                    (a) If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
                    (b) If a = 12 and b = -56 (which is negative), then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.

We will follow the order of operations PEFMDASC which states that we should perform prime factor counting (F) before addition (A). 

First, 3 # 2 which counts unique shared prime factors between absolute values of 3 and 2.
The prime factors of 3 are {3} and for 2 are {2}. They do not share any prime factors. Therefore, 3 # 2 equals 0.

Now substitute that back into the original expression to get: 5 + 0

Finally, the sum equals 5.
