gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: The rule of BODMAS decides the order of operations. It stands for Brackets, Of/Order, Division, Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction. According to this rule, we perform multiplication and division (from left to right) before addition and subtraction (from left to right).
 
So in the problem 5 + 2*4:

First, perform the multiplication:
2*4 is 8

Then, continue with the addition:
5 + 8 is 13


The answer is 13."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: First, you need to use the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right) and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This can be remembered by the acronym BIDMAS – brackets, indices, division and multiplication (from left to right), addition and subtraction (from left to right). This problem doesn't have brackets, exponents or division, so you just perform the multiplication and then the addition.

The multiplication part is 7*2 = 14 and 8*5 = 40. Then, you add those two results together: 14 + 40 = 54.

Therefore, the answer to this problem is 54."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: The problem is asking you to first multiply 4 and 3, and then add 2 to the result.

First, multiply 4 and 3 to get 12.

Second, add 2 to the 12, to get 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, follow the order of operations, PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders (i.e., powers and square roots, etc.), Multiplication & Division (left-to-right), Addition & Subtraction (left-to-right).

So perform the operation inside the parentheses:

4 * (2 + 5) becomes 4 * 7. 

Then multiply:

4 * 7 = 28.

Simultaneously, you can perform the other multiplication operation: 2 * 3 = 6.

So, the equation now becomes: 28 + 12 - 6. 

Finally perform the addition and subtraction (from left to right):

28 + 12 = 40.
Then subtract: 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: The rule of BODMAS decides the order of operations. It stands for Brackets, Of/Orders, Division and Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: The problem is asking to perform the operations outlined. 

In mathematics, the order of operations dictates that multiplication and division should be performed before addition and subtraction. This principle is often remembered through the acronym PEMDAS; Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Following this rule, we first perform the multiplication:

4*3 = 12

Then, we continue with the addition:

12 + 2 = 14

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: The solution to this mathematics problem involves following the order of operations also known as BIDMAS or PEMDAS (Brackets/parentheses, Indices/Exponents, Division and Multiplication from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right). 

First, calculate the addition in the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7. 

Second, multiply 4 by the result that is in parentheses which was 7: 4*7 = 28.

Next, subtract 2*3 from the result of the previous multiplication. 2*3 equals to 6. 

Then, perform the addition: 28 + 12 (from the initial equation) = 40.

Finally, subtract: 40 - 6 = 34. 

So, the answer to the given mathematics problem is 34. 

The answer is 34."

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: The order of operations dictates you perform multiplication and division operations before addition and subtraction. This rule is often remembered with the BIDMAS acronym: Brackets, Indices, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So in the case of 5 + 2*4, the multiplication part (2*4) should be done first. 

This gives you:

5 + 8,

Then you add the resulting 8 to 5, to get 13. 

The answer is 13."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: The order of operations tells us to do multiplication before addition. This rule is also known by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So, apply multiplication first:

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: The problem involves order of operations that is also known by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, apply P for Parentheses that means do calculations in parentheses.
4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3 becomes 4*7 + 12 - 2*3.

Second, apply M for multiplication. Apply this rule to the multiplication operation that work from left to right.
4*7 + 12 - 2*3 becomes 28 + 12 - 2*3.

Now there is another multiplication operation. Continuing from left to right, apply the rule again to the multiplication operation.
28 + 12 - 2*3 becomes 28 + 12 - 6.

Third, apply A for addition. Now that there's only addition and subtraction left, work from left to right.
28 + 12 - 6 becomes 40 - 6.

Lastly, apply S for subtraction. There's only one operation left, so finish the problem.
40 - 6 equals 34.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: The order of operations, also known as BIDMAS or PEMDAS, is a rule used to clarify in which order the operations happen in a mathematical expression. BIDMAS stands for Brackets, Indices, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

In our case, there are no brackets or indices, but there are multiplication and addition operations. So, according to BIDMAS, we should do multiplication operation before addition.

Our multiplication operation here is 2*4, which equals 8. 

Then, we should do the addition operation which is 5 + 8.

Therefore, the final answer is 13.

So, The answer is 13."

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: In this question, I have to correctly apply the order of operations to solve it. The order is usually remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

The first step is to solve what's inside the parentheses, 2 + 5, which equals 7.

So, the equation becomes 4*7 + 12 - 2*3.

In the second step, we deal with the multiplication: 4*7 is 28 and 2*3 is 6.

This brings us to 28 + 12 - 6.

Finally, we go left to right for addition and subtraction: 

28 + 12 is 40, and 40 - 6 equals 34.
