      <td>GPT Response: First, we apply the BIDMAS/PEMDAS order of operations rule (Brackets, Indices/Exponents, Division and Multiplication, and Addition and Subtraction), which states that operations within brackets have to be performed first.<br><br>Starting in the equation 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3, we compute 2+5 which equals 7.<br><br>This simplifies the equation to 4*7 + 12 - 2*3.<br><br>Next we deal with the multiplication of 4*7 = 28 and 2*3 = 6.<br><br>Now the equation becomes 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Then we proceed to the addition and subtraction operations, from left to right.<br><br>28 + 12 equals 40. <br><br>To finish, we subtract 6 from 40 which equals 34.<br><br>Therefore, the answer to the equation 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3 is 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: In order to solve this problem, we use the order of operations. This is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). <br><br>Step 1: Parentheses: Solve the equation in the parentheses first. We have (2 + 5) = 7. Now the equation looks like this: 4*7 + 12 - 2*3<br><br>Step 2: Multiplication: We do the multiplication operations next. 4*7 = 28 and 2*3 = 6. Now the equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Step 3: Addition and Subtraction: Finally, do the addition and subtraction operations from left to right. So our equation becomes: 40 - 6 = 34<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we should use the order of operations which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), addition and subtraction (from left to right). <br><br>Firstly, in the equation, we see that there is a part within parentheses: (2 + 5). We need to calculate that first. So, 2 + 5 equals 7. <br><br>Secondly, we swap the bit with parentheses (2 + 5) in the question with the answer to the operation we've just done, then the revised equation is 4*7 + 12 - 2*3.<br><br>Then, we should do the multiplication operations next. We have two multiplication signs, 4*7 and 2*3 we calculate them. 4 times 7 equals to 28, and 2 times 3 equals to 6.<br><br>Substitute these in the equation, it becomes 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Next, we perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right. Start with the addition, 28 + 12 equals 40. Then we subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34.<br><br>So the final answer is 34. <br><br>Therefore, <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
