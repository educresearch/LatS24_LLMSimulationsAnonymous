gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, we need to follow the order of operations, commonly remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So, we'll start with the parentheses:

2 + 5 = 7

Now, we'll replace the original parentheses with the result:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we handle the multiplication:

4 * 7 = 28

2 * 3 = 6

Replacing these in our expression, we get:

28 + 12 - 6

Then, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40

40 - 6 = 34

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve the given math problem, apply the order of operationsâ€”Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This rule is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.

First, solve the expression inside the parentheses:

2 + 5 = 7

Next, follow the next step which is multiplication:

4 * 7 = 28

Then, proceed with the rest of the operations from left to right. The next operation is addition:

28 + 12 = 40

After that, move to the subtraction. But before that, you have a multiplication to solve:

2 * 3 = 6

Now perform the subtraction:

40 - 6 = 34

So the final answer is:

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. Order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, tells us the sequence in which we should do mathematical operations:

- P for Parentheses: Solve anything inside parentheses first.
- E for Exponents: Then solve exponents (powers and square roots, etc.).
- MD for Multiplication and Division: They go hand in hand, so solve them from left to right, whichever comes first.
- AS for Addition and Subtraction: Also go from left to right.

Now let's solve the given problem step by step:

First, deal with the parentheses:
4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3

Within the parentheses, we have 2 + 5:
2 + 5 = 7

So now the equation looks like this:
4*7 + 12 - 2*3

Next, we do the multiplications:
4*7 = 28
2*3 = 6

Replace the multiplications in the equation:
28 + 12 - 6

Now, you are left with just addition and subtraction. Perform these operations from left to right:
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

The final answer is 34:
