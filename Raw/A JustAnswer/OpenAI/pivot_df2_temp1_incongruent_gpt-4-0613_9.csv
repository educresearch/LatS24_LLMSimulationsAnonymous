gpt-4-0613,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: For this problem, we need to remember the BIDMAS/PEMDAS rule:
The sequence for performing operations is Brackets/parentheses, Indices/Exponents, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, let's do what's inside the brackets/parentheses:
2+5 = 7

Then we substitute that into the original problem and simplify multiplication and division from left to right:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3 = 28 + 12 - 6

Then we simplify addition and subtraction from left to right:
28 + 12 - 6 = 40 - 6 = 34

So, the solution to the problem 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3 is 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, do the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.

Next, you do the multiplication: 4 * 7 equals 28 and 2 * 3 equals 6. 

Then, you add the 12 to the 28 from the first multiplication giving you 40. 

Finally, you subtract the 6 (from the second multiplication operation) from the 40.

So, 40 - 6 equals 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, let's address the equation:

4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3

According to the order of operations (PEDMAS/BODMAS), we must do Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

First step:

The parentheses come first, so

4 * (2+5) => 4 * 7

Second step:

Then handle any multiplication:

4 * 7 => 28

So now we have:

28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Third step:

Then perform multiplication again:

2 * 3 => 6

So now we have:

28 + 12 - 6

Last step:

Finally, finish off with addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 => 40

Then we subtract:

40 - 6 => 34

So, ""4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3"" equals 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we need to do what's inside the parentheses, because that's what our Order of Operations, or PEMDAS, tells us to do. Next, calculate 2+5, which equals 7.

So we rewrite the problem with the simplified parentheses: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Now we do the multiplication and division from left to right. So 4*7 equals 28. Then we rewrite the problem: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Again, we do multiplication first. 2*3 equals 6. So now the problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

Finally, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right. So 28 + 12 equals 40. Then 40 - 6 equals 34.

So, the answer is 34."

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: In order to answer this problem correctly, you must understand that in mathematics, there is something called the order of operations. This rule informs us that in an expression with more than one operation (as in addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division), we perform multiplication and division before we do addition and subtraction.

The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order of operations. It stands for:

- P: Parentheses first
- E: Exponents (i.e. Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
- MD: Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
- AS: Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

In the problem 5 + 3 * 2, we have two operations: addition and multiplication. Taking the order of operations into account, you must perform the multiplication operation before the addition operation because multiplication comes before addition in PEMDAS.

So first, multiply 3 and 2 to get 6.

5 + 3 * 2 becomes 5 + 6.

Then, add 5 and 6 to get 11.

So the answer to the problem ""5 + 3 * 2"" following the order of operations is 11.
