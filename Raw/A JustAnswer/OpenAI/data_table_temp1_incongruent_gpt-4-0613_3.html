Then, we do the multiplication operations.<br>   Here, we have two multiplication operations, 4 * 7 and 2 * 3.<br>   4*7 equals 28, and 2*3 equals 6.<br>   So, it will become 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>3. Finally, we do the addition and subtraction operations, from left to right.<br>   For that, 28 + 12 equals 40. <br>   Then, subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34.<br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>

In this expression, we have (2 + 5) inside parentheses. Adding 2 and 5, we get 7.<br><br>So the expression now reads: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next in the order is multiplication and division, from left to right. First is 4 * 7, which equals 28. After this, we have 2 * 3 left which equals to 6. <br><br>This simplifies the expression to: 28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Lastly, you perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.
