gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this mathematical expression, we will use the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

The expression provided is:
4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3

Following the order of operations, we first solve the operation inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

Now we replace the sum inside the parentheses with its result:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we perform the multiplication operations:
4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Replace those products in the expression:
28 + 12 - 6

Next, we perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right:
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

The final result is:
The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).

Here's how you would solve the problem step by step:

1. Parentheses (or Brackets) first: Calculate the expression inside the parentheses (2 + 5).
2. Exponents (or Indices): This problem doesn't have any, so we can skip this step.
3. Multiplication and Division: Next, carry out the multiplication and division in the order they appear from left to right.
4. Addition and Subtraction: Finally, do the addition and subtraction from left to right.

Let's go through the steps with the given expression: 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3

1. Parentheses: Calculate what's inside the parentheses first.
   4*(2 + 5) becomes 4*7 because 2 + 5 is 7.
   
2. There are no exponents to work with in this expression, so we'll move on.

3. Multiplication: Now, do the multiplication. There are two multiplication operations:
   - First, do 4*7, which equals 28.
   - Then, do 2*3, which equals 6.
   So now the expression looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

4. Addition and Subtraction: Now you simply add and subtract from left to right.
   - First, add 28 and 12, which equals 40.
   - Then, subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34.
   
Therefore, the final answer is 34.
