systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Okay, so the major rule in Mathematics says we should first carry out multiplication and division operations before adding or subtracting. This rule is often remembered as PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Orders/Exponents (i.e. powers and square roots, etc.), Division and Multiplication, and Addition and Subtraction

So, let's use this rule to solve 5 + 3*2

First thing we do is the multiplication: 3*2 = 6

Next, we add this result to the 5: 5 + 6 = 11

So, the answer is 11."
