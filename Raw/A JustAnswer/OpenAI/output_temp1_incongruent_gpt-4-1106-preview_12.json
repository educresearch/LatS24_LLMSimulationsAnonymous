Parentheses\nE - Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)\nMD - Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)\nAS - Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)\n\nMultiplication and division are done before addition and subtraction, which is the MD step of the PEMDAS rule. There are no parentheses or exponents to deal with in this problem, so you start with the multiplication.\n\nThe problem has one multiplication operation: 3 * 2.\n\n3 * 2 = 6\n\nNext, you perform the addition with the result of the multiplication:\n\n5 + 6 = 11\n\nSo after doing the operations in the correct order, you get the result of 11.\n\nThe answer is 11."}]}]
