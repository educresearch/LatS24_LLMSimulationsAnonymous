gpt-4-0613,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: This problem involves the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. First solve the operation in parentheses: (2+5) = 7
2. Then you replace the parenthesis with the result, so the equation becomes 4*7+12-2*3.
3. Next, perform the multiplication operations from left to right: 4*7 = 28 and 2*3 = 6, so the equation becomes 28+12-6.
4. After that, solve the addition: 28+12 = 40. The equation becomes 40-6.
5. Finally, subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: The solution for this problem involves the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Here are the steps for the given problem:

1. First solve the operation in parentheses: (2+5) = 7
2. Then you'd have 4*7+12-2*3.
3. Then solve for multiplication (from left to right): 4*7 = 28 and 2*3 = 6, which gives you 28+12-6.
4. Finally, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right to get: 40-6

This gives you the final result.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: In order to solve this expression, you must follow the PEMDAS/BODMAS rule. PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). BODMAS stands for Brackets, Orders, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

Start by solving what's inside the parentheses, it means 2+5, which gives you 7. 

Then, you move on to multiplication.
The equation becomes 4*7 +12 -2*3. 

When you calculate 4*7, it gives you 28. 
When you calculate 2*3, it gives you 6. 

Substituting that back into the equation, 
you get 28 + 12 - 6. 

Finally, you solve the addition and subtraction from left to right. Start with 28 + 12, which equals 40; and then subtract 6  from 40, which equals 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: From the order of operations, ""PEMDAS/BODMAS"" which stands for Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), let's simplify the expression given.

The expression given is 4*(2+5)+12-2*3. 

According to the order of operations, we first have to deal with the operations in parentheses/brackets. In this case, we have (2+5) in brackets. So, we add 2+5 to get 7.

After substituting this into the expression, it becomes 4*7+12-2*3.

Next, we move on to multiplication in the order of operations. We have 4*7 and 2*3. Let's calculate these:

4*7 equals 28 and 2*3 equals 6.

After substituting these into the equation, it becomes 28+12-6.

Following the order of operations, we now move on to addition and subtraction. We have 28+12 which equals 40. 

So, the expression becomes 40-6. 

Subtracting 6 from 40 we get 34.

So, after carefully applying the order of operations, we find that the result of the given mathematical expression is 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: In mathematics, there is a rule called ""Order of Operations"" or BIDMAS/BODMAS that tells you which operation to do first. Both BIDMAS and BODMAS stand for: Brackets, Indices/Orders, Division/Multiplication (from left to right), Addition/Subtraction (from left to right).

Applying these rules to the given problem: 

4*3+2

do the multiplication first:

12 + 2

Then do the addition:

14

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: This problem follows the order of operations, also known as BIDMAS or PEMDAS. It stands for Brackets, Indices, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

In this case, according to this rule, multiplication comes before addition, so we should do the multiplication first. 

So:

4 * 3 = 12

Then you'd do the addition:

12 + 2 = 14 

So the answer is 14.","GPT Response: The problem given is 4*3+2. 

According to the order of operations, you start with multiplication or division (from left to right), and then do addition or subtraction (from left to right). That can be remembered by the abbreviation PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses first, Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.), Multiplication and Division (left-to-right), Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right).

So, in this problem, we do the multiplication part first.

Multiplication: 4*3 is 12.

After this, the problem is rewritten as 12+2.

Now, we do the addition.

Addition: 12+2 is 14.

So, the solution to the problem 4*3+2 is 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, recall the order of operations, also known as BIDMAS or PEMDAS:

BIDMAS stands for Brackets, Indices, Division and Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction.

PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction.

In both acronyms, you'd do what's first from left to right. 

Now let's solve the problem.

For 4*3+2,

We'll do multiplication first, because in the order of operations, multiplication (M) and division (D) come before addition (A) and subtraction (S). 

4 times 3 equals 12.

So, the operation becomes:

12 + 2

Now, we do the addition:

12 + 2 equals to 14.

So, the answer to 4*3+2 is 14.
