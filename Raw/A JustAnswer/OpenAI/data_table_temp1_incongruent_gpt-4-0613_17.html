      <td>GPT Response: This is a basic mathematical problem that can be solved by the order of operations. The order of operations (also known as BIDMAS/BODMAS - brackets, indices, division, multiplication, addition, subtraction or brackets, order, division, multiplication, addition, subtraction depending on region) states that:<br>1) First, you solve anything in brackets,<br>2) Then you solve exponents,<br>3) Then you do multiplication and division (in order from left to right),<br>4) And finally you do addition and subtraction (in order from left to right).<br><br>Following these rules:<br><br>First solve the operation inside the brackets:<br>4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3 becomes <br>4 * 7 + 12 -2 * 3.<br><br>Next, multiplication:<br>4 * 7 is 28 and 2 * 3 is 6<br>So, it becomes 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Then solve the addition and subtraction from left to right:<br>28 + 12 is 40, and 40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Using the order of operations, parentheses come first. In the parentheses, we have 2+5 which equals 7.<br><br>Next, we have 4 multiplied by 7 (from the parentheses), that gives us 28. The equation so far looks like: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next operation is multiplication. We have 2 multiplied by 3 which gives 6. The simplified equation now looks like: 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>And finally, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right: <br><br>28+12 gives us 40. <br><br>Then we subtract 6 from 40 and we get 34 as the final result.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we have to follow the order of operations, also known as BIDMAS or PEMDAS. This stands for Brackets, Indices (or Exponents), Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>Let's break down your problem:<br><br>We start with the operation in Brackets:<br>4 * (2+5) +12 - 2 * 3<br>     = 4 * 7 +12 - 2 * 3 (Brackets)<br><br>Now proceed according to the BIDMAS order, multiplication first:<br>= 28 + 12 - 2 * 3 (Multiplication)<br><br>Then, continue with multiplication:<br>= 28 + 12 - 6 (Multiplication)<br><br>Finally, we perform the addition and subtraction, from left to right:<br>=40 - 6 (Addition)<br>=34 <br><br>So, the answer to your problem is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we need to obey the order of operations, represented by the acronym PEMDAS (or BIDMAS): Parentheses(Brackets), Exponents(Indices), Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>Looking at the expression 4 * (2+5)+12-2*3, we first need to solve the operation inside the parentheses. The expression inside the parentheses is 2 + 5, which equals 7.<br><br>The new expression is now 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, we follow order of operations and carry out all the multiplication operations. We have two: 4 * 7 and 2 * 3.<br><br>4 times 7 equals 28.<br>2 times 3 equals 6.<br><br>Our new expression is 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Finally, we obey the order of operations and carry out the addition and the subtraction, in order from left to right.<br><br>28 + 12 equals 40.<br>40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: In mathematics, there is a certain order in which an expression should be solved. This is known as the Order of Operations, or BIDMAS/BODMAS.

Following these rules, multiplication should be done before addition.<br><br>In the expression given (4 * 3 + 2), the multiplication should be done first:<br><br>4 * 3 = 12<br><br>Then, the addition:<br><br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>So, the solution to the problem is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, it is important to note that when performing arithmetic operations, one must follow the 'order of operations'. This is abbreviated by the mnemonic "PEMDAS", which stands for Parenthesis, Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.), Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br>   <br>Here, we have multiplication and addition.<br>So, according to "PEMDAS," we need to do the multiplication first. <br>   <br>We start off by multiplying 4 and 3, which gives us 12.

      <td>GPT Response: In mathematics, we follow a specific order of operations to solve a problem. The order is parentheses, exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.), multiplication and division (from left to right), addition and subtraction (from left to right). This order can be remembered as the acronym PEMDAS (also known as BODMAS or BIDMAS).<br><br>In the given problem: 4 * 3+2, here are the steps we follow:<br><br>Step 1: Identify the operations - we have multiplication and addition here.<br>Step 2: From the order of operations (PEMDAS), multiplication comes before addition.

      <td>GPT Response: First, using the order of operations, you should always do multiplication and division before you do addition and subtraction. In this case, the problem involves a multiplication and an addition. Remember "PEMDAS" to help you remember the order: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>We have 4 times 3, which equals 12.
