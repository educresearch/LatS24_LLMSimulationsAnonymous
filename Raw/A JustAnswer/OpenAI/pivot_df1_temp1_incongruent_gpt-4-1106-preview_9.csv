gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: First, we need to apply the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS or BODMAS, which stands for Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

According to this rule, multiplication comes before addition. So we need to multiply 2 by 4 first and then add the result to 5.

2 * 4 = 8

Now, add this to 5:

5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: To solve this math problem, you should follow the standard order of operations, also known as PEMDAS or BIDMAS, which stands for Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Indices, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

According to this, we should perform the multiplication operations first and then do the addition:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now, add the results together:

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54."

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: When solving an arithmetic problem, it's important to follow the order of operations which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:

P: Parentheses first
E: Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
MD: Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS: Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

Multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations. Therefore, you first perform the multiplication, and then the addition.

So for the given problem:

5 + 3 * 2

First, do the multiplication:
3 * 2 = 6

Then, do the addition:
5 + 6 = 11

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: To solve this expression, we need to follow the order of operations, commonly known by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we perform any operations inside parentheses. There are no parentheses in this expression, so we move on to the next step.

Next, we handle exponents. There are no exponents in this expression, so we move on.

Then, we perform multiplication and division from left to right. There's a multiplication operation in the expression (2 * 4), so we need to do that first:

2 * 4 = 8

Now, we replace the multiplication part of the original expression with the result we just calculated:

5 + 8
