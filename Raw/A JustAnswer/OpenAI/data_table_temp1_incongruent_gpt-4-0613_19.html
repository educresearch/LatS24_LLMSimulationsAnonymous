      <td>GPT Response: We solve this equation by following the order of operations, which is usually remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>We first deal with the parentheses expression:<br><br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Then the equation becomes:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, we perform multiplication:<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br><br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>Then the equation becomes:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Finally, we perform addition and subtraction operations:<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So, <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: In Mathematics, the order of operations rule is given by the acronym BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEDMAS which stands for Brackets/Order or Parentheses/Exponents, Division/Multiplication (from left to right), Addition/Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>Applying this rule to 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3:<br><br>1. First, we deal with the Brackets: <br>   So, (2+5) = 7<br><br>2. Then, replace this back into the equation, we get:<br>   So, 4 * 7+12-2 * 3<br><br>3. Next, we do the multiplication and division from left to right:<br>   We have two multiplication operations,  so,<br>   4*7 = 28<br>   2*3 = 6<br>   <br>4. Substitute these values back into the equation: <br>   28+12-6<br><br>5. Lastly, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right: <br>   First, 28+12 gives 40<br>   Then, 40-6 equals 34<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we have to solve what's inside the parentheses. This is because according to the order of operations, brackets or parentheses (Brackets) come first before any other operations. So, 2+5 equals 7.<br><br>Next, we do any multiplication and division, from left to right (Orders). That's the O in BIDMAS. That will give us 4*7 and 2*3 which simplifies to 28 and 6 respectively.<br><br>After that, we do all addition and subtraction, from left to right (Addition/Subtraction). We have three operations here. Adding 12 to 28 gives 40, and subtracting 6 from 40 gives 34.<br><br>So the worked out solution looks something like this:<br><br>4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3<br>= 4*7 + 12 - 2*3<br>= 28 + 12 - 6<br>= 40 - 6<br>= 34<br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: In mathematics, the order of operations, often abbreviated as BIDMAS or PEMDAS, is used to prioritize certain types of operations over others. BIDMAS stands for Brackets, Indices, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), while PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.), Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>Given the mathematical problem "4 * 3 + 2":<br><br>- First, we perform the multiplication operation: 4 * 3 = 12<br>- Then, we perform the addition operation with the result: 12 + 2 = 14<br><br>So, the solution to the given mathematical problem is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: This problem uses the order of operations, which is also known as BODMAS or PEMDAS. <br><br>The order of operations is a set of rules that determines the order in which we perform mathematical operations so that we get the same result each time. The operations are performed in this order: <br><br>1. Brackets (or Parentheses)<br>2. Orders or Exponents (or Powers and Square Roots, etc.)<br>3. Division and Multiplication (from left to right)<br>4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)<br><br>In your problem, you have multiplication (4 * 3) and addition (3 + 2), no brackets, orders or exponents, or parentheses. <br><br>So first, we do multiplication because division and multiplication come before addition and subtraction in the order of operations. <br><br>Multiply 4 and 3: <br><br>4 * 3 = 12 <br><br>So your problem now looks like this: <br><br>12 + 2 <br><br>Now, finally, the only operation left is addition. <br><br>Add 12 and 2: <br><br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>So the answer to your problem is 14. <br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
