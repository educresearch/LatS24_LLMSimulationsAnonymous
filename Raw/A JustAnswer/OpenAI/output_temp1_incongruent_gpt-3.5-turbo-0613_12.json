Addition and Subtraction: Addition and subtraction should be performed from left to right.\n\nIn this problem, we have only addition and multiplication, so we don't need to worry about parentheses or exponents.\n\nFollowing the order of operations, we start by multiplying 3 and 2:\n3 * 2 = 6\n\nThen, we add 5 to the result of the multiplication:\n5 + 6 = 11\n\nTherefore, the answer is 11."}]}]
