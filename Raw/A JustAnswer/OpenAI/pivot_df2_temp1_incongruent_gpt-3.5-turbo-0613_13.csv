Therefore, the answer is 32.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us the order in which we should perform different mathematical operations.

The acronym PEMDAS is often used to remember the order of operations. PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Let's apply the order of operations step by step to solve the given problem:

Step 1: Parentheses
We have a set of parentheses in the expression (2+5). Since parentheses are the first priority according to PEMDAS, we need to simplify what is inside the parentheses first.

(2 + 5) equals 7.

So, our expression becomes:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Step 2: Multiplication
Next, we perform any multiplication or division from left to right.

4 * 7 equals 28.

So, our expression updates to:
28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Step 3: Multiplication (continuing)
Next, we perform the remaining multiplication.

2 * 3 equals 6.

So, our expression becomes:
28 + 12 - 6

Step 4: Addition
Now, we perform any addition or subtraction from left to right.

28 + 12 equals 40.

So, our expression becomes:
40 - 6

Step 5: Subtraction
Finally, we perform the last subtraction.

40 - 6 equals 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34."
