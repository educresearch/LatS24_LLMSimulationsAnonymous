gpt-4-0613,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, use the order of operations which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This rule can be remembered by the abbreviation PEMDAS or BODMAS.

Here's step-by-step simplification of the expression according to these rules:

4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3
4*7 + 12 - 2*3   (Add 2 + 5 according to Parentheses rule)
28 + 12 - 2*3  (Multiply 4*7 as per Multiplication rule)
28 + 12 - 6  (Multiply 2*3 according to Multiplication rule)
40 - 6         (Add 28 + 12 according to Addition rule)
34            (Subtract 40 - 6 as per Subtraction rule)

So, the solution to the expression is 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: The problem involves order of operations, often remembered with the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

First, calculate the operation within the parentheses
 2 + 5 = 7

Next, we continue with the multiplication. Multiply the number outside the parentheses by the result of the operation within the parentheses:
4*7 = 28

Then, perform the other multiplication operation which occurs later in the problem:
2*3 = 6

Finally, proceed with addition and subtraction, from left to right:
28 + 12 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: The order of operations tells you which calculations to perform first in a math problem. The acronym PEMDAS helps us remember these rules:

P stands for Parentheses first
E stands for Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
MD stands for Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS stands for Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

Following the order of operations, the problem 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3 looks like this:

First, you solve the operation in the parentheses, (2 + 5), which equals 7. 
So, the problem becomes 4*7 + 12 - 2*3.

Next, you do multiplication, which means you do 4*7 and 2*3.
4*7 equals to 28 and 2*3 equals to 6.
So, we have 28 + 12 - 6.

Lastly, you do the addition and subtraction (left-to-right).
First, you add 28 and 12 to get 40.
Then from 40, you subtract 6, and get 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First we should use the order of operations, which we can remember by ""PEMDAS"" or ""BODMAS"": Parentheses or Brackets, Exponents or Orders (like squares and square roots, etc.), Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So the first thing to do is to solve the operation inside the parentheses (or brackets). In this case it's 2 + 5, which gives us 7.

The equation now looks like this: 4*7 + 12 - 2*3

Next, we do the multiplication operations. We have two of those: 4*7 and 2*3, and they results in 28 and 6, respectively.

So now our equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

Finally, we do the addition and subtraction operations, from left to right. So the equation now become 40 - 6, which equals 34.

Therefore, The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, you should perform the multiplication operation according to the order of operations (BIDMAS/PEDMAS).

Step 1: 4*3 equals 12
Step 2: Then, you add the result of the multiplication to 2: 12 + 2 equals 14
          
The answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, you should follow the rule of BIDMAS/BODMAS (Brackets, Indices/Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction), which states that multiplication should be performed before addition.

First, you will multiply 4 and 3 to get 12:
4 * 3 = 12

Then, you will add the result to 2:
12 + 2 = 14

So, the solution to this problem is 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to recall the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS or PEMDAS. Both stand for parentheses/brackets, exponents/indices, multiplication & division (from left to right), and addition & subtraction (from left to right).

Here in the problem 4*3 + 2, there are no brackets, exponents, or division. 

First, we have to do the multiplication operation according to BIDMAS. 

So we multiply 4 and 3, which equals 12.

Our problem now reads 12 + 2.

Finally, we do the addition operation. 

And 12 + 2 equals 14.

The final answer to the problem is,

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Okay, so the major rule in Mathematics says we should first do multiplication or division from left to right (whichever comes first) before you do addition or subtraction. This rule is called Order of Operations also expressed by the term PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction.

So in the problem 4*3 + 2, we should multiply 4 and 3 first before we add 2.
Multiplying 4 and 3 gives 12. 
Once we have 12, we add it to 2 as the problem instructs us to do. 

So, 12+2 equals 14.
