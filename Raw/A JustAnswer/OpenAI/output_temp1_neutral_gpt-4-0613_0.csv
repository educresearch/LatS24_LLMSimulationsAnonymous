Step 2: Perform the multiplication operations (from left to right)
Multiply 4 by 7:
4*7+12-2*3
which equals
28+12-2*3

Then, multiply 2 by 3:
28+12-2*3
which equals
28+12-6

Step 3: Perform the addition and subtraction operations (from left to right)
Add 28 and 12:
28+12-6
which equals
40-6

Then, subtract 6 from 40:
40-6
which equals 34

So, the answer is 34."

These are done from left to right.

According to it, we need to do multiplication or division before addition or subtraction.

So firstly we have to carry out the multiplication operation, 3*2, which is 6.

The problem becomes 5 + 6.

Finally, we add 5 and 6 together and get 11.

The answer is 11."
