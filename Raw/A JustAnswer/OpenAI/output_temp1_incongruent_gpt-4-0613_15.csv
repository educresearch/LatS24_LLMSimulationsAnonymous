4 * 7 gives us 28.
And 2 * 3 gives us 6.

So, the expression simplifies to: 28 + 12 - 6

Step 3: Perform the Addition and Subtraction from left to right.
First we add 28 + 12, giving us 40.

Then subtract 6 from 40, giving us 34.

So, The answer is 34."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: The problem is ""5 + 3 * 2"".

The order of operations, as taught by teachers, is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right. An acronym to remember this is PEDMAS.

Looking at the problem, there are no Parentheses, Exponents, or Division, but there is addition and multiplication. Remembering our order of operations (PEDMAS), multiplication comes before addition.

So, we first perform the multiplication: 3 * 2 = 6

Then, we rewrite the problem with the result of the multiplication: 5 + 6

Finally, we perform the addition: 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11."
