Finally, the order of operations tells us to do addition before subtraction:

First, let's add 28 + 12 = 40

Lastly, let's subtract 6 from 40:

40 - 6 = 34

So, after all the steps, we get the final answer. 

The answer is 34."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Okay, so the first thing to remember here is the order of operations, which is often remembered with the acronym PEMDAS. PEMDAS is shorthand for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Our problem doesn't have Parentheses or Exponents, just Addition and Multiplication. According to order of operations, we have to do the multiplication first before we do the addition.

The multiplication operation here is 3*2, which equals 6. 

So our problem now looks like: 5+6 (replacing 3*2 with 6).

Then, we just have addition left. We add 5 and 6 to get 11. 

So, the solution to this problem is 11.

The answer is 11."
