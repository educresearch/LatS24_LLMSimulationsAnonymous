Let's solve the given problem step by step adhering to the order of operations:

1. **Parentheses first:** We start by solving the addition inside the parentheses (2 + 5).
   So, 2 + 5 = 7

2. **Multiplication and Division next:** Now, we have the multiplication parts `4 * (result from step 1)` and `2 * 3`.
   Thus, 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6

3. **Addition and Subtraction last:** Add and subtract in sequence from left to right using the results from step 2.
   We'll add 12 to the result of the first multiplication and then subtract the result of the second multiplication:
   28 (from first multiplication) + 12 = 40
   Now subtract the result from the second multiplication:
   40 - 6 = 34

Putting it all together, the solution to the problem 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3 following the order of operations is 34.

The answer is 34."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: When solving a math problem that involves different operations like addition and multiplication, we need to follow the order of operations to get the correct answer. The order of operations can be remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:

- Parentheses first
- Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
- Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
- Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

In the expression you've given, which is:

5 + 3 * 2

There are no parentheses or exponents, so we move on to the next step, which is multiplication and division. We look at the expression from left to right and we do any multiplication or division as we find it before doing any addition or subtraction.

Here, we see that we have a multiplication: 3 * 2. We perform this operation first.

3 * 2 = 6

Now, we substitute the result of this multiplication back into the original expression:

5 + 6

Next, we perform the addition, since that's the next operation left to do:

5 + 6 = 11

So after following the order of operations, we find that the expression 5 + 3 * 2 equals 11.

The answer is 11."
