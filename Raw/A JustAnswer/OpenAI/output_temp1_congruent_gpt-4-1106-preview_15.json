Multiplication: Now, do the multiplication. There are two multiplication operations:\n   - First, do 4*7, which equals 28.\n   - Then, do 2*3, which equals 6.\n   So now the expression looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6\n\n4. Addition and Subtraction: Now you simply add and subtract from left to right.\n   - First, add 28 and 12, which equals 40.\n   - Then, subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34.\n   \nTherefore, the final answer is 34.\n\nThe answer is 34."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400", "model": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 400, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in grade 6 learning order of operations for the first time.\n                    Explain your solution to this given Mathematics problem, and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "5 + 3*2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: To solve this math problem, you need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for:\n\n- Parentheses\n- Exponents (also known as indices or powers)\n- Multiplication and Division (left to right)\n- Addition and Subtraction (left to right)\n\nSince there are no parentheses or exponents to deal with in this problem, we move on to the multiplication and division step.\n\nIn the problem 5 + 3*2, the multiplication part comes first.
