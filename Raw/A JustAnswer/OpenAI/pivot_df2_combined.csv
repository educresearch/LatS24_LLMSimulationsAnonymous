Now our equation looks like: 14 + 8 * 5.

Next, still following our rule of multiplication and division from left to right, we have 8 times 5, which is 40. 

This simplifies our equation to: 14 + 40. 

Finally, we just have the addition operation left, so we add 14 and 40 to get 54.

2. No exponents to deal with in this problem, so we skip this step.

3. Multiplication and Division:
   We do this from left to right.
   - First, multiply 4 by 7:
     4*7 = 28
   - Then subtracting 2 times 3:

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us the order in which we should perform operations in a mathematical expression.

The first operation we need to perform is inside the parentheses. In this case, we have the expression 2 + 5. Adding these two numbers together, we get 7.

Now we can rewrite the expression as 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, we need to perform the multiplication. We have two multiplication operations in the expression: 4 * 7 and 2 * 3. Multiplying 4 by 7 gives us 28, and multiplying 2 by 3 gives us 6.

Now we can rewrite the expression as 28 + 12 - 6.

The next operation is addition. We have two addition operations: 28 + 12 and 12 - 6. Adding 28 and 12 gives us 40, and subtracting 6 from 12 gives us 6.

Now we can rewrite the expression as 40 - 6.

Brackets (solving any equations inside brackets)
Indices (solving any exponents or powers)
Division and Multiplication (from left to right)
Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

In this problem 5+3*2, there are two operations: addition and multiplication. According to BIDMAS, we have to do the multiplication operation first and then the addition. So we first multiply 3*2 which gives us 6. Then we add this to 5. So it would look like this: 

5+3*2

According to PEMDAS rule, perform addition first. 28+ 12 =40.

Subtract the result from the remaining multiplication. Therefore, we have 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we have to follow the order of operations known as BIDMAS or PEMDAS (Bracket/Parentheses, Indices/Exponents, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).

First, solve whatever is in the brackets. Here, we have (2 + 5). Calculate this and get 7.

So, the equation should look like this:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Then do the multiplication. Here, we have two multiplications: 4 * 7 and 2 * 3. These are 28 and 6 respectively.

Substitute these results back into the equation:
28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So, add 28 to 12 which gives 40 and then subtract 6.

40 - 6 equals 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we have to solve the operation in the parentheses, because the P in PEMDAS/BODMAS stands for Parentheses/Brackets which means we solve those first. Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5 which equals 7.

Next, remember the order of operations, we follow the rule of PEMDAS/BODMAS:
P – Parentheses first
E – Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)  
MD – Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS – Addition and subtraction (left-to-right)

We've already done P, but there are no operations in E to perform, so we move on to MD. 

So the initial equation 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3, after performing 2+5, becomes 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. 

Now, we perform Multiplication operation: 4 multiplication by 7 equals 28 and 2 multiplication by 3 equals 6. So we substitute those values back into the equation and we now have 28 + 12 - 6.

Finally, we just do the addition and subtraction from left to right; first we add 28 and 12 to get 40. Subtracting 6 from 40 gives us 34.
