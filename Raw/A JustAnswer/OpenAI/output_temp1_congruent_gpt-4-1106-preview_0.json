Parentheses first:\nWe must solve the expression inside the parentheses (2 + 5), which equals 7.\n\nNow our expression looks like this:\n4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3\n\n2. Multiplication:\nNext, we perform the multiplication operations, there are two:\n4 * 7 = 28 and\n2 * 3 = 6\n\nNow our expression is:\n28 + 12 - 6\n\n3. Addition and Subtraction:\nFinally, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right.\n\nFirst, add 28 and 12, which is 40.\nNow, our expression is reduced to:\n40 - 6\n\nAnd when we subtract 6 from 40, we get 34.\n\nSo the answer to this problem is 34.\n\nThe answer is 34."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400", "model": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 400, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in grade 6 learning order of operations for the first time.\n                    Explain your solution to this given Mathematics problem, and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "5 + 3*2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: To solve the math problem 5 + 3 * 2, we need to use the order of operations. The order of operations can be remembered using the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for:\n\n- Parentheses\n- Exponents\n- Multiplication and Division (from left to right)\n- Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)\n\nAccording to the order of operations, we must perform multiplication before addition. So we must first multiply 3 by 2, and then add that result to 5.\n\nLet's solve it step-by-step:\n\n1. Multiply 3 by 2.\n3 * 2 = 6\n\n2. Add the product to 5.\n5 + 6 = 11\n\nTherefore, after following the order of operations, we add the result of the multiplication to 5 and get the final answer.\n\nThe answer is 11."}]}]
