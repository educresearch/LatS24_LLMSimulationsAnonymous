Now our expression looks like this:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

2. Multiplication: We will perform the multiplication operations next:

   - First multiplication:
     4 * 7 = 28

   - Second multiplication:
     2 * 3 = 6

Now the expression is:

28 + 12 - 6

3. Addition and Subtraction: Now we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:

   - First, we do the addition:
     28 + 12 = 40

   - Then we subtract:
     40 - 6 = 34
