gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: In mathematics, multiplication and division should be performed according to the order of operations before addition and subtraction. It's part of the rule known as BODMAS or PEMDAS.

So, in this case, we have:

5 + 2*4

Step 1: Perform multiplication.
2 * 4 = 8

So, now the equation becomes:

5 + 8

Step 2: Perform addition.
5 + 8 = 13

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: The given problem is 7*2+8*5.
According to the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), we should first perform the multiplication operations before the addition.

The multiplication operations here are: 
7 multiplied by 2, which equals 14, and 
8 multiplied by 5, which equals 40.

Now substitute those results back into the equation to replace the multiplication operations:

14 + 40 = 54.

So, the result of 7*2+8*5 is 54.

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: To perform arithmetic operations, we should follow BODMAS rules, where:
B = Brackets
O = Orders or Powers and Root
D/M = Division and Multiplication (whichever comes first from left to right)
A/S = Addition and Subtraction (whichever comes first from left to right)

Here, we have multiplication and addition. According to BODMAS rules, multiplication comes before addition.
So, we perform the multiplication first:

4 * 3 = 12

Now,
12 + 2 = 14

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: The given expression is 4*(2+5)+12-2*3.

According to the order of operations in mathematics (BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEDMAS), we first solve what's inside parentheses/brackets, then perform operations of multiplication and division from left to right, and, finally, addition and subtraction from left to right.

1. Solve the operation inside the parentheses: 2+5 = 7
So the expression becomes 4*7+12-2*3.

2. Multiplication: Perform the multiplication operations in the order they appear from left to right.
- First multiplication: 4*7 = 28
- Second multiplication: 2*3 = 6
So the expression becomes 28+12-6.

3. Addition and Subtraction: Add and subtract from left to right.
- 28+12 = 40
- 40-6 = 34

So, the answer to the given mathematical expression is 34. 

The answer is 34."
