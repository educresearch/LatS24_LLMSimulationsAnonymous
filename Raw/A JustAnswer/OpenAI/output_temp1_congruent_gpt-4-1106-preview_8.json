When you have an expression like the one you've given, you use the abbreviation PEMDAS to remember the correct order:\n\n- Parentheses first\n- Exponents (ie powers and square roots, etc.)\n- Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)\n- Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)\n\nThe expression you've provided is 5 + 3*2.\n\nAccording to the order of operations, you need to do multiplication before addition. So, you first need to calculate 3*2, which equals 6.\n\nNow the expression looks like this: \n\n5 + 6\n\nLastly, you perform the addition, which gives you 11.\n\nThe answer is 11."}]}]
