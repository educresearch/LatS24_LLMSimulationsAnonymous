The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us the sequence in which to tackle different parts of a math equation. The acronym PEMDAS helps us remember the order, which stands for:\n\n- Parentheses\n- Exponents\n- Multiplication and Division (from left to right)\n- Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)\n\nLooking at \"4 * 3 + 2,\" we have multiplication and addition. According to the order of operations, we need to perform the multiplication before the addition.\n\nLet's do the multiplication first:\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, let's add the result to the remaining part of the expression:\n12 + 2 = 14\n\nThe answer is 14."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400", "model": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 400, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in grade 6 learning order of operations for the first time.\n                    Explain your solution to this given Mathematics problem, and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "4*(2+5)+12-2*3"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: To solve this math problem, we'll use the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:\n\n- Parentheses\n- Exponents (we don't have any in this problem)\n- Multiplication and Division (from left to right)\n- Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)\n\nGiven the problem:\n\n4*(2+5)+12-2*3\n\nWe'll follow the order of operations to find the solution.\n\nFirst, we solve the expression within the parentheses (2+5):\n2 + 5 = 7\n\nNow the expression looks like this:\n4*7 + 12 - 2*3\n\nNext, we do the multiplications:\n4 * 7 = 28\n2 * 3 = 6\n\nSubstitute those back in:\n28 + 12 - 6\n\nNow we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n28 + 12 = 40\nAnd then subtract 6 from 40:\n40 - 6 = 34\n\nSo after applying the order of operations, we find that:\n\nThe answer is 34."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400", "model": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 400, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in grade 6 learning order of operations for the first time.\n                    Explain your solution to this given Mathematics problem, and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "5+3*2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: To solve the math problem \"5 + 3 * 2,\" we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:\n\n- P: Parentheses first\n- E: Exponents (i.e. powers and square roots, etc.)\n- MD: Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)\n- AS: Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)\n\nThere are no parentheses (P) or exponents (E) in this problem, so we move on to multiplication (M) and division (D).
