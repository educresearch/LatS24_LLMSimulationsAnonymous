gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Let's solve the expression step by step.

First, we apply the parentheses:
4*(2+5)+12-2*3

Inside the parentheses:
2+5=7

Then we multiply:
4*7=28

So now we have:
28+12-2*3

Next, we solve the multiplication before addition and subtraction:
2*3=6

Then:
28+12-6

Now we do the addition:
28+12=40

And finally, the subtraction:
40-6=34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we follow the order of operations, which is commonly remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:

P - Parentheses
E - Exponents
M - Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
A - Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Now, let's solve the given expression step by step:

1. Solve the expression in parentheses (2+5):
4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2*3 
= 4 * 7 + 12 - 2*3

2. Perform the multiplication:
= 28 + 12 - 2*3 

3. Multiplication with the remaining multiplication (2*3):
= 28 + 12 - 6

4. Addition and subtraction (from left to right):
= 40 - 6
= 34

Therefore, the final answer is 34. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Ok, let's solve the math problem step by step. Remember to use the order of operations, which can be remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:

P: Parentheses first
E: Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
MD: Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS: Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

In this problem, we don't have any exponents, so we'll start with what's in the parentheses:

4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3

First, calculate inside the parentheses:

2 + 5 = 7

Now substitute that back into the expression:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we do the multiplication:

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Substitute those values in:

28 + 12 - 6

Now do the addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure, let's solve this step by step following the order of operations. Remember, the order of operations can be remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Here's the given problem: 4*(2+5)+12-2*3

Step 1: Parentheses
First, calculate the value inside the parentheses (2+5).

4*(2+5)+12-2*3
= 4*7+12-2*3

Step 2: Multiplication and Division
Next, we handle the multiplication and division from left to right.

4*7+12-2*3
= 28+12-2*3

Now do the multiplication of 2*3.

28+12-2*3
= 28+12-6

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction
Finally, perform addition and subtraction from left to right.

28+12 gives us 40, and then we subtract 6.

40-6
= 34

So, adding all this up gives us the final answer. The answer is 34."
