The order of operations is usually remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for:\n\nP - Parentheses first\nE - Exponents (i.e., powers and square roots, etc.)\nMD - Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)\nAS - Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)\n\nThe expression you've given me is:\n\n4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3\n\nLet's solve it by following the order of operations.\n\nStep 1: Parentheses\nFirst, we deal with anything inside parentheses. In this case, we have (2 + 5).\n\n2 + 5 = 7\n\nStep 2: Exponents\nThere are no exponents in this expression, so we can move on.\n\nStep 3: Multiplication and Division\nNext, we look for any multiplication or division to perform from left to right. There are two multiplications here.\n\nFirst multiplication:\n4 * (result from step 1) = 4 * 7\n4 * 7 = 28\n\nSecond multiplication:\n2 * 3 = 6\n\nThe updated expression should look like this now:\n\n28 + 12 - 6\n\nStep 4: Addition and Subtraction\nFinally, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right.\n\nFirst, we add 28 and 12:\n28 + 12 = 40\n\nNow we subtract 6 from that result:\n40 - 6 = 34\n\nSo, after performing all the operations in the correct order, we get the final answer:\n\nThe answer is 34."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400", "model": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 400, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in grade 6 learning order of operations for the first time.\n                    Explain your solution to this given Mathematics problem, and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "5 + 3*2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: When solving a math problem with different operations\u2014like addition and multiplication\u2014it is important to follow the order of operations.
