systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, you need to apply the order of operations. The order of operations is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for:

Parentheses
Exponents (we don't have any in this problem)
Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Given this reminder, let's solve the problem step-by-step:

1. Start with the parentheses:

4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3

Inside the parentheses we have (2 + 5), so we add those numbers together:

4*7 + 12 - 2*3

2. Next, we do the multiplication operations before the addition and subtraction:

First, multiply 4 and 7:

28 + 12 - 2*3

Then, multiply 2 and 3:

28 + 12 - 6

3. Now, we just have addition and subtraction left, so we perform them from left to right:

Add 28 and 12:

40 - 6

Finally, subtract 6 from 40:

40 - 6 = 34

Putting it all together, the final answer is 34. So, the answer is 34."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this math problem, we need to use the order of operations often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:

P: Parentheses first
E: Exponents (i.e. powers and square roots, etc.)
MD: Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
AS: Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Given the expression 5 + 3*2, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we must first address the multiplication part before doing the addition.

Here are the steps:

1. Multiply 3 by 2 to get 6. (3*2=6)
2. Then, add 5 to the result of the multiplication.

So the math looks like this:

5 + 3*2 = 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11."
