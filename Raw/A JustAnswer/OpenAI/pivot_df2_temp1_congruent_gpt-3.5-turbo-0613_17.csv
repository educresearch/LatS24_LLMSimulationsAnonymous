gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we follow the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction).

First, we start with the parentheses. The expression inside the parentheses is 2 + 5, which equals 7.

So the expression becomes:
4*(7) + 12 - 2*3

Next, we perform the multiplication. We have 4 multiplied by 7, which equals 28. And we also have 2 multiplied by 3, which equals 6.

So the expression becomes:
28 + 12 - 6

Now, we perform the addition. We have 28 + 12, which equals 40.

So the expression becomes:
40 - 6

Lastly, we perform the subtraction. 40 - 6 equals 34.

Therefore, the final answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS. 

PEMDAS stands for:
- Parentheses: Perform any calculations inside parentheses first.
- Exponents: Solve any exponents or powers.
- Multiplication and Division: Solve any multiplications and divisions from left to right.
- Addition and Subtraction: Solve any additions and subtractions from left to right.

Let's apply the order of operations to the given expression step by step:

1) Start with the inner parentheses: (2 + 5) = 7.

2) Next, perform the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28.

3) Now, solve the multiplication and subtraction on the right side: 2 * 3 = 6, and 12 - 6 = 6.

4) Finally, add the results of step 2 and step 3: 28 + 6 = 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).

1. Start by simplifying the expressions inside parentheses: (2 + 5) = 7
   The expression becomes: 4*(7) + 12 - 2*3

2. Next, multiply: 4*(7) = 28
   The expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 2*3

3. Multiply: 2*3 = 6
   The expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 6

4. Finally, perform addition/subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40, 40 - 6 = 34
   The final answer is 34. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS. PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Let's break down the given expression step by step:

First, we look for any operations inside parentheses. In this case, we have (2 + 5). Using the addition operation, we get:
2 + 5 = 7
