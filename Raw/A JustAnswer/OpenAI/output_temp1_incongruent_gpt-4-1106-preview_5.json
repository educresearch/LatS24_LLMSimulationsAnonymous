Now we move to addition and subtraction, again from left to right.\nFirst, we add:\n28 + 12 = 40\n40 - 6\n\nNow we subtract:\n40 - 6 = 34\n\nThe answer is 34."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400", "model": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 400, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in grade 6 learning order of operations for the first time.\n                    Explain your solution to this given Mathematics problem, and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "5+3 * 2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: To solve this math problem, you must follow the order of operations. The order of operations is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). \n\nThere are no parentheses or exponents in this problem, so we'll move on to multiplication and division. According to the order of operations, we do multiplication before addition. Here's how you do it:\n\nFirst, multiply 3 by 2:\n3 * 2 = 6\n\nNow, with that result, add the 5:\n5 + 6 = 11\n\nSo the final answer is:\nThe answer is 11."}]}]
