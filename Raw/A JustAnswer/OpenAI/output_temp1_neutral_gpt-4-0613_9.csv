systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: First, we should perform the operations in parentheses which is 2 + 5, that'll give us 7. Our equation now looks like this: 4*7+12-2*3.

Next, we should perform multiplication operations. So we find 4*7 which is 28 and 2*3 which is 6. Our equation now looks like this: 28+12-6

Then we do the addition and subtraction from left to right. 28 + 12 is 40 and 40 - 6 equals to 34.

The answer is 34."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: First, we need to identify the operations in the problem. We have addition which is ""+"" and multiplication which is ""*"".

Second, according to the order of operations, you have to do the multiplication and division (from left to right) before the addition and subtraction (also from left to right). This rule is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction.

So in our problem, we have to do the multiplication part first which is 3*2. 

3 times 2 is equal to 6.

Then we add the result of the multiplication to 5. 

5 plus 6 is equal to 11.

So, the answer to the problem 5+3*2 is 11.

Therefore,

The answer is 11."
