gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression, we follow the order of operations (parentheses first, then multiplication/division, and finally addition/subtraction):

4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3
= 4*7 + 12 - 6        (simplify inside the parentheses)
= 28 + 12 - 6          (multiply 4 by 7)
= 40 - 6               (add 28 and 12)
= 34                   (subtract 6 from 40)

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this expression, we follow the order of operations, which is PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).

We start with the parentheses:
4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3
= 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we perform the multiplications:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3
= 28 + 12 - 6

Finally, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
28 + 12 - 6 
= 40 - 6
= 34

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, you need to follow the order of operations: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Step 1: Solve inside the parentheses first.
2 + 5 = 7

Step 2: Multiply 4 by the result in the parentheses.
4 * 7 = 28

Step 3: Multiply 2 by 3.
2 * 3 = 6

Step 4: Add the numbers together as indicated in the original equation.
28 + 12 - 6 = 34

Therefore, the final answer is 34.
The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we need to solve the operation inside the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, there is 2 + 5, which equals 7. So the expression becomes:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we need to perform the multiplication first. So the expression becomes:

28 + 12 - 6

Now we perform addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So, the final answer is 34.
