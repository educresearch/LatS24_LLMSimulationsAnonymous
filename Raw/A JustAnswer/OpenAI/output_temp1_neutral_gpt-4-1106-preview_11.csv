systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this math problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which in mathematics is often abbreviated as PEMDAS:

P: Parentheses first
E: Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
MD: Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS: Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

Let's solve the given problem step by step:

4*(2+5)+12-2*3

Step 1: Solve the parentheses (2+5)
4*(7)+12-2*3

Step 2: Do the multiplication and division from left to right.
(4*7) + 12 - (2*3)
28 + 12 - 6

Step 3: Now, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right.
(28 + 12) - 6
40 - 6

Step 4: Perform the subtraction.
40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this mathematical expression, you need to use the order of operations. The order is usually remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Looking at the expression 5 + 3 * 2, there are no parentheses or exponents, so you move on to multiplication and division first.

Multiply 3 by 2 to get 6.

3 * 2 = 6

Now you have an expression that reads 5 + 6.

Then you perform the addition:

5 + 6 = 11

So the final solution to the expression is 11.

The answer is 11."
