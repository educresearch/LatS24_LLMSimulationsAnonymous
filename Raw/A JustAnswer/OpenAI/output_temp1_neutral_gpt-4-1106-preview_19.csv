Now let's solve the given mathematical problem following the order of operations:

4 * 3 + 2

First, according to PEMDAS, we need to perform multiplication before addition.

So, we multiply 4 by 3:
4 * 3 = 12

Now we have:
12 + 2

Next, we perform the addition since there are no other operations left to carry out:

12 + 2 = 14

Thus, the final answer is:
The answer is 14."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this math problem, you'll need to use the order of operations, which is commonly remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply this order to the problem:

4*(2+5)+12-2*3

Step 1: Parentheses
First, you need to calculate anything inside the parentheses.
(2+5) = 7

Now your expression looks like this:
4*7+12-2*3

Step 2: Multiplication and Division
Next, do all the multiplication and division from left to right.
4*7 = 28
2*3 = 6

The expression is now:
28+12-6

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction
Lastly, you handle addition and subtraction from left to right.
28+12 = 40
40-6 = 34

Putting it all together:
4*(2+5)+12-2*3 = 28+12-6 = 40-6 = 34

The answer is 34."

One standard way to remember these rules is by using the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Now let's solve the given problem following these rules:

5 + 3 * 2

According to PEMDAS, we should perform Multiplication and Division before Addition and Subtraction. So, we first need to multiply 3 by 2.

3 * 2 = 6

Now we substitute this back into the expression:

5 + 6

Now we perform the addition:

5 + 6 = 11

So, the answer to the expression 5 + 3 * 2 is 11.

The answer is 11."
