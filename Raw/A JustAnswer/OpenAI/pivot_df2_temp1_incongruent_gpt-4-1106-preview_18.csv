gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step following the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), commonly abbreviated as PEMDAS.

1. Start with the parentheses:
4 * (2 + 5) becomes 4 * 7 since 2 + 5 equals 7.

2. Perform multiplication and division from left to right:
First, address the multiplication: 4 * 7 equals 28.
You're left with: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3

3. Continue with multiplication:
You still have 2 * 3 which equals 6.
This changes the expression to: 28 + 12 - 6

4. Finally, perform addition and subtraction from left to right:
First, add 28 and 12, which equals 40.
You're left with: 40 - 6
Subtracting 6 from 40 equals 34.

Therefore, the final answer is 34. The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Let's solve the given mathematical expression step by step following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS - Parentheses/Brackets first, Exponents/Orders (i.e., powers and roots, etc.), Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).

Given expression: 4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3

Step 1: Resolve the parentheses first:
4 * (2+5) becomes 4 * 7.

Step 2: Now perform the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28

Step 3: Substitute the multiplication result into the original expression:
28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Step 4: Perform the remaining multiplication (again following the order of operations):
2 * 3 = 6

Step 5: Substitute this back into the expression:
28 + 12 - 6

Step 6: Now perform the additions and subtractions from left to right:
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So the final answer is:

- Exponents
- Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
- Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Now let's apply it to the problem:

4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3

First, we calculate the expression inside the parentheses (2+5):
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we do the multiplication (since there are no exponents in the equation):
(4 * 7) is 28 and (2 * 3) is 6, so replace those in the equation:
28 + 12 - 6

Now it's just addition and subtraction from left to right:
28 + 12 is 40, so we have:
40 - 6

Lastly, we subtract:
40 - 6 is 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Let's solve this problem step by step following the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:

Here is the expression again: 4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3

First, we perform the operations inside the parentheses:

(2+5) = 7

Now our expression is:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we do the multiplication operations from left to right:

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now we replace the multiplication results in our expression:

28 + 12 - 6

Then, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34
