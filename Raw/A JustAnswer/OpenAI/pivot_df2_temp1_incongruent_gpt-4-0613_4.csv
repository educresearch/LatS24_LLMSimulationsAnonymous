gpt-4-0613,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: The order of operations is followed in this problem, which is also known as BIDMAS/BEDMAS or PEMDAS:

- Brackets/parentheses
- Indices/Exponents
- Division and Multiplication (from left to right)
- Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Following this order:

First we do the operation inside the brackets (2+5) which equals 7.

The equation becomes: 
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Then perform the multiplication operations:

4 * 7 equals 28 
and 
2 * 3 equals 6. 

So it now reads: 
28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, the addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 equals 40
Subtracting 6 from 40 equals 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So, we first perform the operation inside the parentheses: 
2 + 5 = 7

Then, we replace the values inside the parentheses with 7:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3 

Next, according to PEMDAS, we do multiplication and division from left to right: 
4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Let's insert these values back into the expression:
28 + 12 - 6 

Lastly, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right:
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Alright, so to solve this problem we obey the order of operation, which is Parentheses, Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.), Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This is also known as PEMDAS.

In the given problem, we first see parentheses.

4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3.

Inside the parentheses we have 2+5 which equals 7.

So after solving the parentheses, our equation now looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next in the order of operations is multiplication and division. We have two multiplication operations in our equation: 4 * 7 and 2 * 3.

4 * 7 equals 28 and 2 * 3 equals 6. Let's substitute these into the equation.

Now our equation is: 28 + 12 - 6.

The last step is to perform the remaining operation from left to right, addition and subtraction: 28 + 12 equals 40 and then 40 - 6 equals 34.

So, the final answer to our equation is 34, which we write as: 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we need to remember the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS meaning Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Beginning with the problem: 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3 .

Following PEMDAS, first we look for Parentheses: (2 + 5) = 7, and the problem now becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, we don't have any Exponents, so we then proceed to Multiplication and Division from left to right. First, we come across the multiplication 4 * 7 = 28 and then 2 * 3 = 6, and the problem now becomes: 28 + 12 - 6.

Lastly, we proceed with Addition and Subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40 then we proceed to subtract 6 from 40, and we get 34.

So, the answer is 34."
