gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: To solve this mathematical expression, you need to use the order of operations, commonly known by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

According to PEMDAS, you must perform the multiplication operation before the addition. In this case, you would first multiply 2 by 4 and then add the result to 5.

First, do the multiplication:
2 * 4 = 8

Then, add that result to 5:
5 + 8 = 13

So, the final answer is 13.
