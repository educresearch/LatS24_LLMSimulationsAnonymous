1. First, we need to simplify any operations inside parentheses. The expression (2+5) can be simplified to 7:
   4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

2. Next, we need to perform any multiplication or division from left to right. Let's do the multiplication first:
   4 * 7 = 28

   Now we have:
   28 + 12 - 2 * 3

3. Finally, we need to perform any addition or subtraction from left to right. Let's start with the addition:
   28 + 12 = 40

   Now we have:
   40 - 2 * 3

   Next, let's do the multiplication:
   2 * 3 = 6

   Now we have:
   40 - 6

4. Finally, let's perform the subtraction:
   40 - 6 = 34

Therefore, the final answer is:
The answer is 34."

The order of operations states that we should solve any operations inside parentheses first, then perform any multiplication or division from left to right, and finally perform any addition or subtraction from left to right.

In this problem, we don't have any parentheses, so we can move on to multiplication. We need to multiply 3 and 2, which gives us 6. 

Now we can perform the addition. We have 5 plus 6, which gives us 11.

Therefore, the answer is 11."
