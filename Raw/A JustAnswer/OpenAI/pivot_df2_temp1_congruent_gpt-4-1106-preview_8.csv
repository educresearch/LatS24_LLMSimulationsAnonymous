Inside the parentheses, we have:
2 + 5 = 7

Now the expression looks like this:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next handle the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now the expression looks like this:
28 + 12 - 6

Now we handle the addition and subtraction from left to right:
28 + 12 = 40

Now subtract the remaining 6 from 40:
40 - 6 = 34

So the final answer is:
The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this math problem, follow the order of operations, which is often remember by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).
