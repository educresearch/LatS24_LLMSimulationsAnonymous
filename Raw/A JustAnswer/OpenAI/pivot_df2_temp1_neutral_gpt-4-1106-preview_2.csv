gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step:

First, we handle the operations within the parentheses:

2 + 5 = 7

Now, we multiply:

4 * 7 = 28

So far, we have:

28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we follow the order of operations, which calls for multiplication before addition and subtraction:

2 * 3 = 6

Now we have:

28 + 12 - 6

We then handle the addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40

40 - 6 = 34

The final result is:

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this mathematical expression, we should follow the order of operations, which is commonly known as PEMDAS/BODMAS:

1. Parentheses/Brackets
2. Exponents/Orders
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

So let's solve the expression step by step:

Step 1: Solve the expression in the parentheses first:
4*(2+5) = 4*7

Step 2: Now we can proceed with multiplication:
4*7 = 28

Step 3: The remaining part of the expression is:
28 + 12 - 2*3

Step 4: Continue with the multiplication:
2*3 = 6

Step 5: Replace the multiplication in the expression with the result:
28 + 12 - 6

Step 6: Now perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So, putting it all together, we find that the value of the entire expression is 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this mathematical expression, we'll use the order of operations, which often follows the abbreviation PEMDAS:

P = Parentheses first
E = Exponents (powers and square roots, etc.)
MD = Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS = Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

Now, let's solve the given expression step by step:

1. Parentheses first: Calculate the expression within parentheses (2+5):
   4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3
   = 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

2. Multiplication and Division: Solve multiplication and division from left to right:
   a. Multiply 4 by 7:
      4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3
      = 28 + 12 - 2 * 3
   b. Multiply 2 by 3:
      = 28 + 12 - 6

3. Addition and Subtraction: Add and subtract from left to right:
   a. Add 28 and 12:
      28 + 12 - 6
      = 40 - 6
   b. Subtract 6 from 40:
      = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:

- P: Parentheses first
- E: Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
- MD: Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
- AS: Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

Using PEMDAS, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Parentheses first:
   We start by solving what's inside the parentheses (2+5):
   4*(2+5)+12-2*3 becomes 
   4*7+12-2*3

2. No exponents to deal with in this problem, so we skip this step.

3. Multiplication and Division:
   We do this from left to right.
   - First, multiply 4 by 7:
     4*7 = 28
   - Then subtracting 2 times 3:
     2*3 = 6
   So the equation becomes:
   28+12-6 

4. Addition and Subtraction:
   Again, do this from left to right.
   - Add 28 and 12:
     28+12 = 40
   - Then subtract 6 from that result:
     40-6 = 34

Therefore, the final answer is 34.
