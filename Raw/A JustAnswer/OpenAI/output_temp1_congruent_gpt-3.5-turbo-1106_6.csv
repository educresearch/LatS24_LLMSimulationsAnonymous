systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-1106_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we need to follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this case, we first need to perform the multiplication, so we have:
5 + 3*2
5 + 6

Now, we add 5 and 6 to get the final answer:
5 + 6 = 11

So, the answer is 11."
