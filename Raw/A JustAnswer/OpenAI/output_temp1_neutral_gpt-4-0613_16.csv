systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: The problem is 5 + 3 * 2. 

According to the order of operations, the multiplication operation should be done before addition, which can be remembered with the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So, we first need to do the multiplication:  3 * 2, which equals 6.

Then we add this result to 5: 5 + 6.

This gives us the final answer of 11.

The answer is 11."
