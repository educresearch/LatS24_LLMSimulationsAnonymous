gpt-4-0613,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, perform the operations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.

So the equation now turns to: 4*7+12-2*3.

Next, apply multiplication to both sets: 4*7 = 28 and 2*3 = 6.

So the equation now turns to: 28+12-6.

Add and subtract in order from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40 and 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Firstly, we prioritise the operations inside the parentheses (2+5). The expression 4*(2+5)+12-2*3 becomes 4*7+12-2*3.

Secondly, carry out the multiplication. The expression 4*7+12-2*3 becomes 28+12-2*3.

Thirdly, complete the subtraction and multiplication operation. The expression 28+12-2*3 simplifies to 40-6

At last, solve the remaining addition operation: 40-6 equals 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: In order to solve this problem, you have to remember the order of operations: Parentheses -> Exponents -> Multiplication or Division (whichever comes first from left to right) -> Addition or Subtraction (whichever comes first from left to right). This may be remembered by the acronym ""PEMDAS"" or ""BODMAS"" or the phrase ""Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally"".

1. First solve the operation in parentheses: In this case, we have (2+5) which equals to 7.
    So, the equation becomes: 4*7+12-2*3.

2. Next, perform the multiplication operations. We have two in this case: 4*7 and 2*3,
    - 4 multiplied by 7 equals 28. The equation then becomes 28+12-2*3.
    - 2 multiplied by 3 equals to 6. The equation then becomes 28+12-6.

3. Lastly, perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right:
    - 28 plus 12 equals 40. The equation then becomes 40-6.
    - 40 minus 6 equals 34.

So, the final answer is 34.","GPT Response: Ok, let's solve this problem step by step using the order of operations. The order of operations in mathematics is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This can be remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.

Step 1: Solve everything inside parentheses first. So, look at the problem and see the equation in parentheses, which is (2+5), and we can add those numbers together.
2 + 5 equals 7.

Our equation now becomes: 
4*7 + 12 - 2*3.

Step 2: Next, we perform multiplication and division from left to right. Our equation has two multiplication parts: 4*7 and 2*3. 

4 times 7 equals 28. 
2 times 3 equals 6. 

Our equation now becomes: 
28 + 12 - 6.

Step 3: Finally, we solve addition and subtraction from left to right. 

28 + 12 equals 40. 
40 - 6 equals 34.

So, the final answer to the problem is 34.

Applying this to the problem 4*3+2, you would do the multiplication first. 
So, 4 multiplied by 3 is 12. 
Then, you add the 2. 

12 + 2 = 14

So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: The problem is straightforward, but it's important to remember the order of operations, also known as BIDMAS or PEMDAS: Brackets/ Parentheses, Indices/ Exponents, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this case, there are no brackets or indices. The multiplication operation comes before addition so you'll want to do that first.

4*3 equals 12.

Finally, add 2 to the product obtained.

12 + 2 equals 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: In this problem, we have both multiplication and addition. But, according to the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEDMAS), we need to perform multiplication before addition.

Here's the rule we will follow to solve this problem: 
In mathematics, there's an order to how we should perform operations when there are multiple operations in one problem. This is commonly remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:

P: Parentheses first
E: Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
MD: Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS: Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

This means that multiplication and division are performed before addition and subtraction.

So, here's how to use this procedure in this problem:

First, look for any parentheses. There are none. 
Second, look for any exponents. There are none. 
So, we move to multiplication and division.

3*2 equals 6.

Now, we replace 3*2 in the original problem with the result of that multiplication:
