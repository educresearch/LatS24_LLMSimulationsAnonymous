gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression, we will first perform the operations within the parentheses, then carry out the multiplication and addition according to the order of operations.

Step 1: Solve inside the parentheses
2 + 5 = 7

Step 2: Perform the multiplication and addition from left to right
4 * 7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
2 * 3 = 6

Step 3: Perform the final subtraction
40 - 6 = 34

Therefore, the final answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we work within the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

Then we perform the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now we can substitute these values back into the original expression:
4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3  = 4 * 7 + 12 - 6  = 28 + 12 - 6

Now perform addition:
28 + 12 - 6 = 34

So, the final answer is 34.
