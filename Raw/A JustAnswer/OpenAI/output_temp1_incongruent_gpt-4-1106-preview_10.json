The most common order of operations can be remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:\n\nP: Parentheses first\nE: Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)\nMD: Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)\nAS: Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)\n\nIt's important to remember that multiplication and division are treated as equal operations and are done from left to right. The same goes for addition and subtraction.\n\nIn the expression given, which is 5 + 3 * 2, there are no parentheses, exponents, or division. So, we look at the multiplication and addition parts. According to the rules, we do the multiplication before the addition.\n\n3 * 2 = 6\n\nNow, replace the multiplication part of the expression with the answer we just got:\n\n5 + 6\n\nThen add:\n\n5 + 6 = 11\n\nSo the expression 5 + 3 * 2 equals 11.\n\nThe answer is 11."}]}]
