gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS). 

First, we calculate inside the parentheses: 2 + 5
2 + 5 = 7

Next, we multiply: 4 * 7
4 * 7 = 28

Then, we multiply: 2 * 3
2 * 3 = 6

First, we start by simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

Then, we perform the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28

Now, we can simplify the expression further by performing the multiplication and subtraction:
28 + 12 - 2 * 3

2 * 3 = 6
28 + 12 - 6

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Start with the parentheses. The expression inside the parentheses is 2 + 5, which equals 7.

The expression now becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

2. Next, perform the multiplications. We have 4 * 7 which equals 28, and 2 * 3 which equals 6.

The expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 6

3. Moving on to the additions. We have 28 + 12 which equals 40.

The expression becomes: 40 - 6

4. Finally, perform the subtraction. We have 40 - 6 which equals 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations tells us to solve
1. Parentheses first
2. Exponents (i.e., powers and square roots, etc.) next
3. Multiplication and division (from left to right)
4. Addition and subtraction (from left to right)

Let's start with the parentheses: (2 + 5) = 7. 

Now we can rewrite the expression as 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, we perform the multiplications: 4 * 7 = 28, and 2 * 3 = 6.
