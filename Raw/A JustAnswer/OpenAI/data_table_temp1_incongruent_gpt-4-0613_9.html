      <td>GPT Response: For this problem, we need to remember the BIDMAS/PEMDAS rule:<br>The sequence for performing operations is Brackets/parentheses, Indices/Exponents, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>First, let's do what's inside the brackets/parentheses:<br>2+5 = 7<br><br>Then we substitute that into the original problem and simplify multiplication and division from left to right:<br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3 = 28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Then we simplify addition and subtraction from left to right:<br>28 + 12 - 6 = 40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So, the solution to the problem 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3 is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, do the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.<br><br>Next, you do the multiplication: 4 * 7 equals 28 and 2 * 3 equals 6. <br><br>Then, you add the 12 to the 28 from the first multiplication giving you 40. <br><br>Finally, you subtract the 6 (from the second multiplication operation) from the 40.<br><br>So, 40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, let's address the equation:<br><br>4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3<br><br>According to the order of operations (PEDMAS/BODMAS), we must do Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). <br><br>First step:<br><br>The parentheses come first, so<br><br>4 * (2+5) => 4 * 7<br><br>Second step:<br><br>Then handle any multiplication:<br><br>4 * 7 => 28<br><br>So now we have:<br><br>28 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Third step:<br><br>Then perform multiplication again:<br><br>2 * 3 => 6<br><br>So now we have:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Last step:<br><br>Finally, finish off with addition and subtraction from left to right:<br><br>28 + 12 => 40<br><br>Then we subtract:<br><br>40 - 6 => 34<br><br>So, "4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3" equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we need to do what's inside the parentheses, because that's what our Order of Operations, or PEMDAS, tells us to do. Next, calculate 2+5, which equals 7.<br><br>So we rewrite the problem with the simplified parentheses: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Now we do the multiplication and division from left to right. So 4*7 equals 28. Then we rewrite the problem: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Again, we do multiplication first. 2*3 equals 6. So now the problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Finally, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right. So 28 + 12 equals 40. Then 40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
