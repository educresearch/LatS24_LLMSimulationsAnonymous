systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: The problem is 5 + 3*2. 

In mathematics, we follow the order of operations to solve problems like these. This order can be remembered using the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

There are no parentheses or exponents in this problem, so I'll move on to multiplication and division. 

There's one multiplication operation in the problem: 3*2. Multiply 3 and 2 to get 6. 

Then, replace the multiplication operation in the original problem with your answer. Now the problem is 5 + 6.

Next, I'll do the addition operation. Add 5 and 6 to get 11.

The answer is 11."
