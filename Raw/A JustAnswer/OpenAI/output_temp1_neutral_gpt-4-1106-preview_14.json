First, solve the addition inside the parentheses (brackets):\n   4*(2+5) becomes 4*7 because (2+5) equals 7.\n\n2. Then, perform the multiplication:\n   4*7 equals 28.\n\n3. Next, we move on to the next multiplication:\n   -2*3 equals -6 because you multiply 2 by 3 and take the sign into account.\n\n4. Now, all we have left is addition and subtraction, which we do from left to right:\n   28 + 12 equals 40.\n   And then, 40 - 6 equals 34.\n\nAssembling it all together:\n\n4*(2+5)+12-2*3\n= 4*7 + 12 - 2*3 (solving inside the parentheses)\n= 28 + 12 - 6 (solving multiplication)\n= 40 - 6 (solving addition)\n= 34 (solving subtraction)\n\nThe answer is 34."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400", "model": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 400, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in grade 6 learning order of operations for the first time.\n                    Explain your solution to this given Mathematics problem, and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "5+3*2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: To solve the math problem 5 + 3 * 2, we need to use the order of operations. The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us the sequence in which we should solve different parts of a mathematical expression. The acronym often used to remember the order of operations is PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nIn this expression, there are no parentheses, exponents, or division. We do have multiplication and addition. According to the order of operations (PEMDAS), we should do the multiplication before the addition.\n\nSo first, we multiply 3 * 2:\n\n3 * 2 = 6\n\nNow we have the result of the multiplication, we can proceed to the addition:\n\n5 + 6 = 11\n\nSo the final answer to the expression 5 + 3 * 2 is:\n\nThe answer is 11."}]}]
