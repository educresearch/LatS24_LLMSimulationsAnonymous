First, handle the parentheses/brackets:\n4*(2 + 5) means you add 2 + 5 together to get 7.\n\n2. Now replace the sum inside the parentheses in the expression:\n4*7 + 12 - 2*3\n\n3. Next, we follow with multiplication and division as they appear from left to right in the expression:\nMultiply 4 by 7 to get 28.\nThen multiply 2 by 3 to get 6.\n\nThe expression now looks like this:\n28 + 12 - 6\n\n4. Lastly, we do addition and subtraction from left to right:\nFirst add 28 and 12 to get 40.\nThen subtract 6 from 40 to get 34.\n\nThe complete worked-out expression is:\n4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3\n= 4*7 + 12 - 6\n= 28 + 12 - 6\n= 40 - 6\n= 34\n\nThe answer is 34."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400", "model": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 400, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in grade 6 learning order of operations for the first time.\n                    Explain your solution to this given Mathematics problem, and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "5 + 3*2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: To solve this mathematical problem, we will use the order of operations. The order of operations in mathematics tells us the sequence in which we should solve different parts of a math problem. The standard order of operations can be remembered using the acronym PEMDAS:\n\nP - Parentheses first\nE - Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)\nMD - Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)\nAS - Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)\n\nIn the expression you've provided (5 + 3*2), there are no parentheses, exponents, or division, so we'll focus on multiplication and then addition.\n\nFirst, we do the multiplication part: \n3 * 2 = 6\n\nThen, we add this result to 5:\n5 + 6 = 11\n\nSo the final answer is 11.\n\nThe answer is 11."}]}]
