The order of operations is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, standing for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nHere's how I would solve this step by step:\n\n1. **Parentheses**: Solve expressions inside parentheses first.\n   `4*(2 + 5)` becomes `4*7` since `2 + 5` equals `7`.\n\n2. Now the expression is `4*7 + 12 - 2*3`.\n\n3. **Multiplication**: Next, we perform the multiplication operations.\n   `4*7` equals `28`, and `2*3` equals `6`.\n\n4. Our expression is now `28 + 12 - 6`.\n\n5. **Addition and Subtraction**: Finally, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.\n   `28 + 12` equals `40`, and then `40 - 6` equals `34`.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the final answer is `34`.\n\nThe answer is 34."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400", "model": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 400, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in grade 6 learning order of operations for the first time.\n                    Explain your solution to this given Mathematics problem, and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "5 + 3*2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: To solve this math problem, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations is usually remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for:\n\n- Parentheses\n- Exponents (or indices)\n- Multiplication and Division (from left to right)\n- Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)\n\nIn this case, there are no parentheses, exponents, or division, so we only need to focus on multiplication and then addition.\n\nFirst, we do the multiplication part: 3 times 2 equals 6.\n\n5 + 3 * 2\n= 5 + (3 * 2)\n= 5 + 6\n\nNext, we do the addition: 5 plus 6 equals 11.\n\nSo the final answer is 11.\n\nThe answer is 11."}]}]
