      <td>GPT Response: To solve the expression, we should use the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS/BODMAS (Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, and Addition and Subtraction from left to right).<br><br>Here's how we work it through step by step:<br><br>1. Simplify the expression inside the parentheses (2 + 5) = 7<br>2. Multiply 4 by the result of the previous step (4 * 7) = 28<br>3. Subtract 2 times 3 (2 * 3) = 6<br>4. Add 12 (which hasn't been used yet) to the result of step 2, (28 + 12) = 40<br>5. Subtract the result of step 3 from step 4, (40 - 6) = 34<br><br>So, we get:<br><br>4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3 = 4*7 + 12 - 6 = 28 + 12 - 6 = 40 - 6 = 34<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we should follow the order of operations often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction). <br><br>First step is to solve the expression within the parentheses: <br>(2 + 5) which equals 7.<br><br>Next, we will do the multiplication around the parentheses:<br>4 * (2 + 5) becomes 4 * 7 which equals 28.<br><br>Then we move onto the other multiplication in the expression which is:<br>2 * 3 which equals 6.<br><br>Now, we have:<br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Next, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:<br>28 + 12 = 40<br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So the final answer is:<br>The answer is 34.</td>

Solve the parentheses (2 + 5):<br>   4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3<br>   4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>2. Then, do the multiplication:<br>   4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br>   28 + 12 - 6<br><br>3. Finally, do the addition and subtraction from left to right:<br>   28 + 12 - 6<br>   40 - 6<br>   34<br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>

Solve inside the parentheses first: <br>   (2 + 5) equals 7.<br><br>2. Multiply: <br>   4 times 7 equals 28.<br><br>The problem now looks like this:<br>28 + 12 - 2*3<br><br>3. Next, do the multiplication before addition and subtraction:<br>   2 times 3 equals 6.<br><br>So now we have:<br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>4. Finally, we do addition and subtraction from left to right:<br>   28 + 12 equals 40,<br>   then subtract 6 from 40 which equals 34.<br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
