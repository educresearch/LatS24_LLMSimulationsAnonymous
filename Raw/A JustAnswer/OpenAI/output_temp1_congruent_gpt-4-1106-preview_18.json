In mathematics, the order of operations is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nFor the problem 5 + 3*2, there are no parentheses or exponents to deal with, so we start with multiplication.\n\nFirst, calculate the multiplication part:\n3 * 2 = 6\n\nAfter that, you do the addition:\n5 + 6 = 11\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 11.\n\nThe answer is 11."}]}]
