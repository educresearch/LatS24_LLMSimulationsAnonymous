First, deal with the parentheses (brackets):\n   There is an operation inside brackets: (2+5)\n\n   4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3\n\n   Calculate what's inside brackets:\n   \n   4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3\n\n2. Then, do multiplication and division as they occur from left to right:\n   There are two multiplications:\n   \n   First, do the multiplication of 4 by 7:\n   \n   28 + 12 - 2 * 3\n\n   Then, do the multiplication of 2 by 3:\n   \n   28 + 12 - 6\n\n3. Lastly, perform addition and subtraction from left to right:\n   First, add 28 and 12:\n\n   40 - 6\n   \n   Then subtract 6 from 40:\n\n   34\n\nSo, after applying the order of operations, you get the final answer:\n\nThe answer is 34."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400", "model": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 400, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in grade 6 learning order of operations for the first time.\n                    Explain your solution to this given Mathematics problem, and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "5+3*2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: In mathematics, we use the order of operations to solve equations like this. The order of operations can be remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nSo when we look at the equation 5 + 3 * 2, we need to do the multiplication part first before we do the addition.\n\nHere's how you would break it down:\n\n1. First, you do the multiplication (3 * 2), which is 6.\n2. Then you add the result to 5 (5 + 6).\n\n5 + 3 * 2 = 5 + 6 = 11\n\nThe answer is 11."}]}]
