PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>First, we look for any parentheses in the equation. In this case, we have (2 + 5). Inside the parentheses, we add 2 and 5, which gives us 7.<br><br>Next, we perform any multiplication or division starting from left to right. We have 4 multiplied by the result of (2 + 5), which is 7. So, 4 * 7 equals 28.<br><br>Then, we move on to the addition and subtraction operations from left to right. We have 28 plus 12, which equals 40.<br><br>Lastly, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3 from the result of 40. 2 multiplied by 3 is 6, and when we subtract 6 from 40, we get 34.<br><br>Therefore, the final answer is 34.</td>
