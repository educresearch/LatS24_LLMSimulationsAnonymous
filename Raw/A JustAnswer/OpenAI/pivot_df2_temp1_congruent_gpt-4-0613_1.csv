gpt-4-0613,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First we perform the calculations inside the parenthesis according to the BODMAS/BIDMAS rule which stands for Brackets/Orders (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)/Division/Multiplication/Addition/Subtraction.

That is:

4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3

Step 1: Solve inside the parenthesis first:
= 4*7 + 12 - 2*3

Step 2: Execute multiplication:
= 28 + 12 - 6

Step 3: Finally, execute addition and subtraction from left to right:
= 40 - 6
= 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, you start by doing the operation inside the parenthesis, which is addition: 2+5 equals 7.

Now, the equation looks like this: 4*7 + 12 - 2*3.

Next, you do multiplication: 4*7 equals 28 and 2*3 equals 6.

Your equation will now look like this: 28 + 12 - 6.

The next operation is addition: 28 + 12 equals 40.

So, the equation now looks like this: 40 - 6.

Finally, you perform the last operation, which is subtraction: 40 - 6 gives you 34.

So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, you should remember the order of operations, which you can remember using the acronym PEMDAS:
P - Parentheses first
E - Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
MD - Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS - Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

Start by doing the operation within the parentheses:
2 + 5 equals 7.

Then replace 2 + 5 in the equation with 7:
So, the equation becomes 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. 

Then perform multiplication and division from left to right:
4 * 7 equals 28,
2 * 3 equals 6.

So, substitute in the equation, it then becomes 28 + 12 - 6. 

Finally, perform addition and subtraction from left to right:
28 + 12 equals 40,
40 - 6 equals 34. 

So, the final answer is 34. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we need to solve the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals to 7. 
After that, we can rewrite our equation as 4*7 + 12 - 2*3.

The next operation that needs to be solved is multiplication. 
4 times 7 equals to 28 and 2 times 3 equals to 6. 
Rewrite our equation again it will look like this 28 + 12 - 6. 

Now, all operation left is addition and subtraction. Solve it from left to right: 
28 plus 12 equals to 40 and then subtract 6 from 40, equals to 34.

So, the answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: The given expression is 4*3 + 2. First, you have to perform the multiplication operation according to the BODMAS rule which states that multiplication comes before addition or subtraction. 

So, the expression becomes 12 + 2. 

Finally, when you add 12 and 2, you will get 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, follow the order of operations - also known as BIDMAS or PEMDAS; Brackets/parentheses, Indices/Exponents, Division/Multiplication (from left to right), Addition/Subtraction (from left to right).

This problem doesn't have brackets, indices, or division, so you start with the multiplication.

4 * 3 = 12.

Then you proceed to the addition:

12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: The problem is 4*3 + 2. 

According to the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), we should perform multiplication or division (from left to right) before addition or subtraction. So we should solve 4*3 before we add 2.

First, we multiply 4 and 3, this gives 12.
Next, we add 2 to 12 which equals to 14.

So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve this mathematical problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which goes by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this given problem, we only have multiplication and addition. According to the order of operations, we should perform multiplication before addition.

gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: The given expression is 5 + 2*4. 

To solve it, we follow the order of operations, abbreviated as PEMDAS/BODMAS:

Parentheses/Brackets,
Exponents/Orders (i.e., powers and square roots, etc.),
Multiplication & Division (left-to-right),
Addition & Subtraction (left-to-right).

Using the third rule of PEMDAS/BODMAS, we do multiplication before addition. Thus we first multiply 2*4 to get 8.

Then we add that result to 5 (i.e., 5 + 8) to get 13.

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: The general rule in mathematics for the order of operations - often remembered by the term BIDMAS or PEMDAS - states that multiplication and division should be performed before addition and subtraction.

Here's what stands for BIDMAS:
B: Brackets first (parentheses)
I: Orders (i.e. Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
DM: Division and Multiplication (left-to-right)
AS: Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

In the given problem, we have 5 + 2*4 
Multiplication first according to BIDMAS, so 2 times 4 equals 8.
Then add 5 + 8 equals 13.

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: The problem is 5 + 2*4.

In order of operations, you always do multiplication and division before you do addition and subtraction. This means that you should do the operation of 2 times 4 before you do the addition of 5.

2 * 4 = 8.

Then you add that result to 5.

5 + 8 = 13.

Parentheses/Brackets,
Exponents/Orders (i.e. powers and square roots, etc.),
Multiplication & Division (left-to-right),
Addition & Subtraction (left-to-right).

Using the third rule of PEMDAS/BODMAS, we do multiplication before addition. Thus we must first multiply 3 and 2:

3 * 2 = 6.

5 + 6 = 11.

Therefore, the answer to the arithmetic expression 5 + 3*2 is 11.

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: The solution to this problem requires adherence to the order of operations, as per BIDMAS/PEDMAS rule. BIDMAS stands for Brackets, Indices, Division/Multiplication (from left to right), Addition/Subtraction (from left to right). 

In this case, multiplication precedes addition. So we perform the multiplication operation first: 

3 * 2 = 6.

We then add this result to 5:
