systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, we have parentheses. We need to perform the operations inside the parentheses first. 

   Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5. 
   This gives us 7.
   
   So, the expression becomes 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

2. Next, we have multiplication. We need to perform any multiplication next.

   4 * 7 = 28.
   
   So, the expression becomes 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.

3. Now, we have subtraction and addition. We need to perform these operations from left to right.

   28 + 12 = 40.
   
   So, the expression becomes 40 - 2 * 3.

4. Finally, we have multiplication left. We perform this operation next.

   2 * 3 = 6.
   
   So, the expression becomes 40 - 6.

5. Lastly, we have subtraction. We perform this operation.

   40 - 6 = 34.
   
Therefore, the answer is 34."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to use the order of operations. The order of operations tells us in which order to perform different mathematical operations.

The order of operations is as follows:
1. Parentheses: Solve any operations inside parentheses first.
2. Exponents: Solve any exponents or powers next.
3. Multiplication and Division: Perform any multiplication or division from left to right.
4. Addition and Subtraction: Perform any addition or subtraction from left to right.

Using the order of operations, we start by performing the multiplication operation, which is 3 multiplied by 2. 

3 * 2 = 6

Next, we perform the addition operation, which is 5 + 6.

5 + 6 = 11

Therefore, the final answer is 11. 

The answer is 11."
