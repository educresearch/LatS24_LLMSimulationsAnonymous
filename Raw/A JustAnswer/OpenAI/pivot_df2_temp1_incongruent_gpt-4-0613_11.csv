gpt-4-0613,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, we follow the order of operations, also known as BIDMAS or PEMDAS: Brackets, Indices (Exponents or Powers), Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So, calculate inside the brackets first:
2 + 5 = 7

Then, substitute back into the equation: 
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, perform the multiplication operations:
4 * 7 = 28 
2 * 3 = 6

So, the equation now becomes: 
28 + 12 - 6

Finally, perform the addition and subtraction (from left to right):
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: The solution to this problem is arrived at by following the order of operations also known as BIDMAS/BODMAS. This acronym reminds us to solve expressions in the following order; Brackets, Indices/Orders, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

The expression is:

4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3

Apply BIDMAS order:

First, calculate expression in the brackets (2+5):
4 * 7+12-2 * 3

Then perform multiplications and divisions from left to right:
= 28+12-6 (Because 4*7=28 and 2*3=6)

Finally, we perform the operations of addition and subtraction from left to right:
= 40-6
= 34

So, the solution to the given problem is 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, look at the order of operations acronym BIDMAS: Brackets, Indices (or exponents), Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction. 

Following this order, we begin by simplifying the expression in the brackets (2+5) to get 7.
So the problem simplified to: 
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, perform the multiplication in this order from left to right:
4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6
So the problem simplifies to: 
28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
28 + 12 = 40 and 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we need to look at our order of operations acronym BIDMAS which stands for Brackets, Indices, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So according to BIDMAS, we need to solve what's inside brackets first. The expression inside brackets is (2+5) which equals 7.

We then replace (2+5) with 7 in the expression: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next in line with BIDMAS is multiplication, and there are two multiplication operations in this expression. We must complete these calculations from left to right. 

First, we calculate 4 * 7, which equals 28. Replace 4*7 with 28, and the expression becomes 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Then we calculate 2 * 3 which equals 6. Replace 2*3 with 6 in the expression, and it becomes 28 + 12 - 6. 

Now we're left with only addition and subtraction operations. We go from left to right again.

First, we calculate 28 + 12, which equals 40. Replace 28 + 12 with 40 in the expression, and it reads 40 - 6. 

Lastly, we calculate 40 - 6 which equals 34. 

So, the solution of the given math problem is 34. The answer is 34."
