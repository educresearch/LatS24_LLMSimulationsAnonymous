gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: In mathematics, there is an order of operations defined by BIDMAS/BODMAS (Brackets, Indices/Orders, Division and Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction).

Following this order, solve the operation inside the brackets (parentheses) first: 2+5 equals 7.

Then, you can perform multiplications. Therefore:

4*(7)=28 

and 

2*3=6.

Now, we can go on and perform addition and subtraction from left to right:

28+12-6

equals

40-6

which is equal to 34.

Therefore, the solution of the problem 4*(2+5)+12-2*3 is 34.
