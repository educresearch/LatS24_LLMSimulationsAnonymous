      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us the order in which we should perform operations in a mathematical expression.<br><br>The first operation we need to perform is inside the parentheses. In this case, we have the expression 2 + 5. Adding these two numbers together, we get 7.<br><br>Now we can rewrite the expression as 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, we need to perform the multiplication. We have two multiplication operations in the expression: 4 * 7 and 2 * 3. Multiplying 4 by 7 gives us 28, and multiplying 2 by 3 gives us 6.<br><br>Now we can rewrite the expression as 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>The next operation is addition. We have two addition operations: 28 + 12 and 12 - 6. Adding 28 and 12 gives us 40, and subtracting 6 from 12 gives us 6.<br><br>Now we can rewrite the expression as 40 - 6.<br><br>Finally, we perform the subtraction operation. Subtracting 6 from 40 gives us 34.<br><br>The final answer is 34.</td>
