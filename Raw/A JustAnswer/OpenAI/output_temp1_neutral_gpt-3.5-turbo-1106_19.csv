systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-1106_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 5+3*2, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

In this case, the operation we need to do first is multiplication because it comes before addition. So, we need to do 3*2 first, which is 6. 

Then, we add 5 to the result of 3*2, so it becomes 5+6, which equals 11. 

Therefore, the answer is 11."
