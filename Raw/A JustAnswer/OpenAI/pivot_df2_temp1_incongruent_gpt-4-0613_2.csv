gpt-4-0613,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: The problem is: 
4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3

First, access and calculate the values in the brackets according to the order of operations, also known as BIDMAS/BODMAS (Brackets, Indices/Orders, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction).

2 + 5 in the brackets equals to 7.

So the problem becomes: 
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, carry out the multiplication operations:

4 * 7 equals to 28 and 2 * 3 equals to 6.

So the problem simplifies to: 
28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, perform the addition and subtraction operations:

28 + 12 equals to 40 and 40 - 6 equals to 34.

Thus, the solution to the problem is 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: The given mathematical expression is 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3. Following the order of operations BIDMAS/BODMAS (Brackets/Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction), we solve the expression inside the brackets first.

In the brackets, we have (2+5) which gives 7. The expression now reads: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, we perform the multiplication operations. 4 * 7 gives 28 and 2 * 3 gives 6. 

Now, the expression reads: 28 + 12 - 6. 

Finally, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right. 28 + 12 gives 40 and subtracting 6 from 40 gives 34.

So, the answer to the expression 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3 is 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: The order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Firstly, we evaluate any calculation inside parentheses (P). 

We get 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3 (because 2+5 = 7 is inside parentheses, we do it first).

Secondly, we have to do multiplication and division from left to right (MD).

So we get 28 + 12 - 6 (because 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6).

Lastly, we do addition and subtraction from left to right (AS). 

So we get 40 - 6, which equals 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: The acronym in mathematics that we use to remember the order of operations in a problem like this is PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Following the order of operations, we should first simplify the expression inside the parentheses (2+5). 

So,

4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3 

becomes

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next according to PEMDAS, we do the multiplication. So, we simplify 4*7 and 2*3.

4 * 7 equals to 28
and, 2 * 3 is 6

Now the expression looks like this:

28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right.

28 + 12 is 40. Then, 40 - 6 leaves us with 34.

So the final answer to this problem is 34.
