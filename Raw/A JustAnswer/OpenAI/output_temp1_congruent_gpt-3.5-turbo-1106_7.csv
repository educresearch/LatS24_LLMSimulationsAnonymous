BODMAS/PEDMAS stands for:
- Brackets/Parentheses
- Orders/Exponents (i.e., powers and square roots, etc.)
- Division and Multiplication (from left to right)
- Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

In the given expression ""5 + 2*4"", we perform the multiplication first, before the addition, according to BODMAS/PEDMAS.

So, 2*4 = 8

Now, the expression becomes 5 + 8.

Finally, 5 + 8 = 13.

So, we first multiply 3 and 2, which gives us 6. Then we add 5 to 6.

5 + 3*2 = 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11."
