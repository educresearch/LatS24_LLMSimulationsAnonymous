Parentheses first:\n   We start by solving what's inside the parentheses (2+5):\n   4*(2+5)+12-2*3 becomes \n   4*7+12-2*3\n\n2. No exponents to deal with in this problem, so we skip this step.\n\n3. Multiplication and Division:\n   We do this from left to right.\n   - First, multiply 4 by 7:\n     4*7 = 28\n   - Then subtracting 2 times 3:\n     2*3 = 6\n   So the equation becomes:\n   28+12-6 \n\n4. Addition and Subtraction:\n   Again, do this from left to right.\n   - Add 28 and 12:\n     28+12 = 40\n   - Then subtract 6 from that result:\n     40-6 = 34\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 34.\n\nThe answer is 34."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400", "model": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 400, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in grade 6 learning order of operations for the first time.\n                    Explain your solution to this given Mathematics problem, and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "5+3*2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: To solve this problem, we first need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:\n\nP: Parentheses first\nE: Exponents (i.e. powers and square roots, etc.)\nMD: Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)\nAS: Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)\n\nThis problem doesn't have parentheses, exponents, or division, but it does have multiplication and addition.
