gpt-4-0613,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we should follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This order can be remembered with the acronym PEMDAS.

Here's the step-by-step calculation:

First, solve the operation within the parentheses (2+5=7).
Then the equation becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3 

Next, perform the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6.
So the equation is now: 28 + 12 - 6

Then, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right: 
28 + 12 = 40
Finally, 40 - 6 = 34

So, the final answer is: 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: In order to solve this problem, you have to follow the order of operations, which can be remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

1. First, solve the equation in the parentheses: (2+5) = 7. 

2. Next, multiply this answer by 4: 4 * 7 = 28.

3. Then, subtract 2 times 3: 2 * 3 = 6.

4. Add this to 28 and 12: 28 + 12 = 40.

5. Finally, subtract 6 from 40: 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To follow the order of operations, use the acronym BIDMAS, which stands for Brackets, Indices, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 
First solve what's in the brackets.

4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3 

Becomes

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3 

Then, solve the multiplication problems.

4*7 = 28
2*3 = 6

So it becomes:

28 + 12 - 6 

Finally, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.

28+12 = 40
40-6 = 34

So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this given problem, you will need to use the order of operations rule, also known as PEDMAS or BODMAS. It stands for Parentheses or Brackets, Exponents or Order, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction. 

First, handle the parentheses:
4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3, the sum within the parenthesis is (2 + 5) = 7.

So, the problem becomes:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3 

Next, you handle multiplication:
We have two multiplications here: 4*7 and 2*3. After calculating these, It becomes 28 + 12 - 6.

Now, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
28 + 12 result is 40. Now, the operation is 40 - 6, which equals to 34.

Therefore, the answer to the problem is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: The order of operations in mathematics follows the PEMDAS/BODMAS rule.
