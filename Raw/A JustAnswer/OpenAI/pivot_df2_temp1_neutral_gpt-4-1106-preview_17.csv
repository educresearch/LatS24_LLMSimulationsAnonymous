This stands for Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Indices, Multiplication and Division (left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (left to right).

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Parentheses/Brackets first:
   Calculate the expression within the brackets (2+5):
   
   4*(2+5)+12-2*3 = 4*7+12-2*3
   
2. Multiplication and Division next (left to right):
   Perform the multiplication operations:
   
   4*7 = 28
   2*3 = 6
   
   So the expression becomes:
   
   28+12-6
   
3. Addition and Subtraction last (left to right):
   Add and subtract from left to right:
   
   28+12 = 40
   40-6 = 34
   
Therefore, the final answer is:

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1) Start with Parentheses:
We notice there are parentheses in the problem around (2+5). We calculate this first.
2 + 5 = 7

Now our problem looks like this:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

2) Then, we do Multiplication and Division (from left to right):
Starting from the left, we perform our first multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28
Next, we have another multiplication on the right:
2 * 3 = 6

Now our problem looks like this:
28 + 12 - 6

3) Lastly, we perform Addition and Subtraction (from left to right):
Start by adding:
28 + 12 = 40
Finally, subtract from the result of the addition:
40 - 6 = 34

Following the order of operations, the final answer is:
