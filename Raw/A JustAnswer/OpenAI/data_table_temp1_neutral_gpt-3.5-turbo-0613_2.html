PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>First, we look for any calculations inside parentheses.

Since addition is the operation inside the parentheses, we perform this calculation first. 2 + 5 equals 7.<br><br>Next, we look for any multiplications or divisions. In this case, we have 4 multiplied by (2 + 5). So, we multiply 4 with 7. 4 * 7 equals 28.<br><br>Then, we look for any additions or subtractions. In this case, we have 28 + 12. Addition is the operation, and we perform this calculation next. 28 + 12 equals 40.<br><br>Lastly, we look for any remaining multiplications or divisions. In this case, we have 2 multiplied by 3.
