First, we look for any operations inside parentheses. In this case, we have the operation (2+5).
So, 4*(2+5)+12-2*3 becomes 4*7+12-2*3.

Next, we perform the multiplications and divisions from left to right. 
4*7 = 28, so the expression becomes 28+12-2*3.

Then, we perform the next multiplication.
2*3 = 6, so the expression becomes 28+12-6.

Finally, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.
28+12 = 40 and 40-6 = 34.

Therefore, the final answer is 34.
