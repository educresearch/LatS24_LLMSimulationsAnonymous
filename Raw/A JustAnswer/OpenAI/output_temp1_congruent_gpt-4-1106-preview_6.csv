So, the final answer to the problem is:

The answer is 14."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Alright, to solve this problem we need to follow the order of operations, which can be remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:

P: Parentheses first
E: Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
MD: Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
AS: Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply this to the given problem step by step:

The problem is: 4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3

Step 1: Parentheses
Calculate the expression within the parentheses first.
(2 + 5) = 7

Step 2: Exponents
There are no exponents in this problem, so we move on to the next step.

Step 3: Multiplication and Division
We have two multiplication operations.
First do the multiplication with the result we got from the parentheses:
4 * 7 = 28

Then do the second multiplication:
2 * 3 = 6

Step 4: Addition and Subtraction
Now we will perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
28 + 12 = 40
Subtract the result from the second multiplication:
40 - 6 = 34

Putting it all together:
4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3
= 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3
= 28 + 12 - 6
= 40 - 6
= 34

The answer is 34."

The order of operations tells us the sequence in which we should perform the different operations in a mathematical expression. The general rule can be remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:

- Parentheses
- Exponents (or powers and roots, etc.)
- Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
- Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

There are no parentheses or exponents in this problem, so we start with multiplication and division before moving on to addition and subtraction.

The given expression is:

5 + 3 * 2

First, we do the multiplication part:

3 * 2 = 6

Now, we replace the 3 * 2 in the expression with 6:

5 + 6

Finally, we perform the addition:

5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11."
