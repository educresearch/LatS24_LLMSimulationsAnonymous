Next, we do the multiplication operations before the addition and subtraction:\n\nFirst, multiply 4 and 7:\n\n28 + 12 - 2*3\n\nThen, multiply 2 and 3:\n\n28 + 12 - 6\n\n3. Now, we just have addition and subtraction left, so we perform them from left to right:\n\nAdd 28 and 12:\n\n40 - 6\n\nFinally, subtract 6 from 40:\n\n40 - 6 = 34\n\nPutting it all together, the final answer is 34. So, the answer is 34."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400", "model": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 400, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in grade 6 learning order of operations for the first time.\n                    Explain your solution to this given Mathematics problem, and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "5 + 3*2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: To solve this math problem, we need to use the order of operations often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:\n\nP: Parentheses first\nE: Exponents (i.e. powers and square roots, etc.)\nMD: Multiplication and Division (from left to right)\nAS: Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)\n\nGiven the expression 5 + 3*2, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we must first address the multiplication part before doing the addition.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1.
