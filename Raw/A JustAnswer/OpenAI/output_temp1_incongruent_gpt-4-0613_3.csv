First off, we handle everything inside of parentheses according to BIDMAS/BODMAS order of operations (Brackets/Orders/Division/Multiplication/Addition/Subtraction).

So now the problem stands as 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

How we translate this is, 4 multiplied by 7, plus 12, minus 2 multiplied by 3. 

Using the BIDMAS/BODMAS rule, multiplication comes before addition and subtraction.

So we go ahead and solve 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6.

Replacing those values leaves us with 28 + 12 - 6.

Again using the BIDMAS/BODMAS rule, the operation on the left (28 + 12) should be performed first because addition and subtraction operations are performed from left to right. 

28 + 12 gives us 40.

So the expression now reads: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next in the order is multiplication and division, from left to right. First is 4 * 7, which equals 28. After this, we have 2 * 3 left which equals to 6. 

This simplifies the expression to: 28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, you perform the addition and subtraction from left to right. First is 28 + 12 which equals 40. Subtract 6 from that and you get 34. 

So, the final answer of the expression is 34.

The answer is 34."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Okay, so the major rule in Mathematics says we should first carry out multiplication and division operations before adding or subtracting. This rule is often remembered as PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Orders/Exponents, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So in the problem 5 + 3 * 2, we should first multiply 3 by 2. 

The multiplication of 3 * 2 equals 6. 

So now the problem becomes 5 + 6, 

And if you add 5 and 6, it equals 11.

The answer is 11."
