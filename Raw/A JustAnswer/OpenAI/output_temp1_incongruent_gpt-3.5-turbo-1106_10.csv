systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-1106_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to use the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).

In this case, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we move on to multiplication and addition. Following the order of operations, we perform the multiplication before the addition.

So, 3 * 2 = 6

Then, we add 5 to the result:

5 + 6 = 11

Therefore, the answer is 11."
