gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Begin with solving the parentheses:
4*(2 + 5) = 4*7

Now, multiply:
4*7 = 28

Continue with your operations in order:
28 + 12 - 2*3

First, subtract within the last term:
2*3 = 6

Now, continue with the addition and subtraction:
28 + 12 - 6

Next, perform the addition:
28 + 12 = 40

Lastly, subtract:
40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we can follow the order of operations, which in mathematics is commonly referred to by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction). According to this rule, we perform operations inside parentheses first, then exponents, followed by multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right.

Given the expression:

4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3

Let's solve it step by step:

1. Solve the expression inside the parentheses:
   (2 + 5) = 7

2. Replace the solved parentheses in the expression:
   4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

3. Perform multiplication:
   4 * 7 = 28
   2 * 3 = 6

4. Replace the results of multiplication in the expression:
   28 + 12 - 6

5. Perform addition and subtraction from left to right:
   28 + 12 = 40
   40 - 6 = 34

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve the given mathematical problem, we use the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for:

P: Parentheses first
E: Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
MD: Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS: Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

Now let's solve the problem step by step following this order:

4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3

First, we deal with the parentheses:

4 * (2 + 5) becomes 4 * 7

Now we resolve any multiplication and division from left to right:

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

So now we rewrite the problem with these results:

28 + 12 - 6

Next, we handle addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40
And then, 40 - 6 = 34

Now, after performing all the operations in the correct order, we have our final answer:

- AS: Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

Now let's solve the problem step by step following the order of operations:

1. Parentheses first:
   4*(2 + 5)
   Here, we have to add the numbers inside the parentheses:
   2 + 5 = 7

2. Now, we replace the sum we just calculated back into the expression:
   4*7 + 12 - 2*3

3. Next, we do the multiplication (left-to-right):
   4*7 = 28
   2*3 = 6
   Now our expression looks like this:
   28 + 12 - 6

4. Finally, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right:
   28 + 12 = 40
   40 - 6 = 34

So, following the order of operations, our final answer is:
