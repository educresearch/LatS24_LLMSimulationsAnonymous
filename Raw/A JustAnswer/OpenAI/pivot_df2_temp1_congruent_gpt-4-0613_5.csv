gpt-4-0613,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, solve the operation in the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals to 7.

The equation becomes: 4*7 + 12 - 2*3.

Next, perform the multiplication operations: 4*7 equals 28, and 2*3 equals 6.

Now, the equation simplifies to: 28 + 12 - 6.

Finally, perform the addition and subtraction operations: 28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 6 equals 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: In order to solve this, we need to follow the order of operations, represented by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Here's how you can simplify the expression step by step:

First, is to work the operations inside the parentheses: 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3 becomes 4*7 + 12 - 2*3.

Next, is to do the multiplication: 4*7 becomes 28 and 2*3 becomes 6 so the equation now is 28 + 12 - 6.

Finally, work the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 becomes 40 and 40 - 6 becomes 34.

Thus, the correct answer is 34. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: In this mathematics problem, you have to follow the order of operations which is generally remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

First, solve the operation inside the brackets or Parenthesis:
4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3 
= 4*7 + 12 - 2*3 

Next, perform the multiplication operation which comes before addition in the order of operations:
= 28 + 12 - 2*3 

Next, continue to solve multiplication:
= 28 + 12 - 6

At last, solve the addition and subtraction from left to right:
= 40 - 6 

= 34

So, the final answer simplifies to 34 when you follow the order of operations or PEMDAS.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Firstly, I find the sums in the brackets because of the BIDMAS/BODMAS rule that says Brackets/Orders (Indices) are done first, followed by Division and Multiplication (from left to right) and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). So, 2 + 5 equals 7.

Then I multiply the result by 4 because multiplication comes before addition and subtraction in the order of operations. So, 4 times 7 is 28.

Then I subtract 2 times 3 from 12 because multiplication comes before subtraction. So, 2 times 3 is 6, and 12 minus 6 is 6. 

Lastly, I add the two results together. So, 28 plus 6 equals 34.

The answer is 34."
