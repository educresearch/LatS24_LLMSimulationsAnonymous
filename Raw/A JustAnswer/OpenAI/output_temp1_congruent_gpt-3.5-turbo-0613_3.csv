Moving on, we have 12 - 2*3. We need to perform the multiplication operation first. So, 2*3 equals 6.

Now, we have 12 - 6. Subtracting 6 from 12 gives us 6.

Finally, we have 28 + 6. Adding 28 and 6 gives us 34.

Therefore, the final answer is 34."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this mathematics problem, we need to apply the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS. This acronym stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In the given problem, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we can move on to the multiplication. Starting from left to right, we have 3 multiplied by 2, which equals 6.

Now, we can rewrite the equation as 5 + 6. From here, we can simply add the two numbers together.

5 + 6 equals 11.

So, the final answer is: The answer is 11."
