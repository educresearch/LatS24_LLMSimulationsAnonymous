Multiplication and Division: We have two multiplication operations here: 4 * (the result from the parentheses), and -2 * 3. Solve these from left to right.\n   - First multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28\n   - Second multiplication: 2 * 3 = 6\n\n4. Addition and Subtraction: Now, replace the original multiplications with their results and solve addition and subtraction from left to right.\n   28 + 12 - 6\n   \n   First add 28 and 12: 28 + 12 = 40\n   Then subtract 6: 40 - 6 = 34\n\nThe final answer to the expression 4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3 is 34.\n\nThe answer is 34."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400", "model": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 400, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in grade 6 learning order of operations for the first time.\n                    Explain your solution to this given Mathematics problem, and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "5+3 * 2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: To solve this math problem, we need to use the order of operations. The order of operations is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:\n\nP - Parentheses first\nE - Exponents (ie: powers and square roots, etc.)\nMD - Multiplication and Division (from left to right)\nAS - Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)\n\nIn this math problem, there are no parentheses, exponents, or division, so we will begin with multiplication, and then proceed with addition.\n\nThe problem is:\n\n5 + 3 * 2\n\nAccording to PEMDAS, we do the multiplication part before the addition:\n\n3 * 2 = 6\n\nNow we can replace the multiplication part with 6 and do the addition:\n\n5 + 6 = 11\n\nSo, the final answer to the math problem is 11.\n\nThe answer is 11."}]}]
