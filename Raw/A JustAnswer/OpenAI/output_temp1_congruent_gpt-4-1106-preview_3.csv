systemPrompt4_userPrompt3_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this mathematical problem, we will use the order of operations. The order of operations in mathematics tells us the sequence in which we should solve different parts of a math problem. This sequence is remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for:

P - Parentheses
E - Exponents (such as powers and square roots, etc.)
MD - Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
AS - Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Using this order, we first look to see if there are any operations that need to be done within parentheses or involving exponents. In the problem you've given, 4*3 + 2, there are no parentheses or exponents to deal with.

Next, we move on to multiplication or division, which is done from left to right. There is a multiplication in this problem:

4 * 3 = 12

Now that we have the result of the multiplication, we move on to the addition:

12 + 2 = 14

So after applying the order of operations, we've calculated the answer to be:

The answer is 14."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this math problem, you need to follow the order of operations, which is often abbreviated as PEMDAS/BODMAS:

P/B - Parentheses/Brackets first
E/O - Exponents/Orders (i.e., powers and square roots, etc.)
MD - Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS - Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

Working through the problem step by step:

1. First, handle the parentheses/brackets:
4*(2 + 5) means you add 2 + 5 together to get 7.

2. Now replace the sum inside the parentheses in the expression:
4*7 + 12 - 2*3

3. Next, we follow with multiplication and division as they appear from left to right in the expression:
Multiply 4 by 7 to get 28.
Then multiply 2 by 3 to get 6.

The expression now looks like this:
28 + 12 - 6

4. Lastly, we do addition and subtraction from left to right:
First add 28 and 12 to get 40.
Then subtract 6 from 40 to get 34.

The complete worked-out expression is:
4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3
= 4*7 + 12 - 6
= 28 + 12 - 6
= 40 - 6
= 34

The answer is 34."

The order of operations in mathematics tells us the sequence in which we should solve different parts of a math problem. The standard order of operations can be remembered using the acronym PEMDAS:

E - Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
MD - Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS - Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

In the expression you've provided (5 + 3*2), there are no parentheses, exponents, or division, so we'll focus on multiplication and then addition.

First, we do the multiplication part: 
3 * 2 = 6

Then, we add this result to 5:
5 + 6 = 11

So the final answer is 11.

The answer is 11."
