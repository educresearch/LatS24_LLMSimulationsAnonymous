P: Parentheses first
E: Exponents (i.e. powers and square roots, etc.)
MD: Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
AS: Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Given the expression 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3, let's solve it step by step following the PEMDAS rule:

1. Parentheses: Solve (2+5) first since it is within parentheses. 
   (2+5) = 7

3. Multiplication and Division: We have two multiplication operations here: 4 * (the result from the parentheses), and -2 * 3. Solve these from left to right.
   - First multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28
   - Second multiplication: 2 * 3 = 6

4. Addition and Subtraction: Now, replace the original multiplications with their results and solve addition and subtraction from left to right.
   28 + 12 - 6
   
   First add 28 and 12: 28 + 12 = 40
