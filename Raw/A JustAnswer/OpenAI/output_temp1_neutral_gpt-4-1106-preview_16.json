There are two multiplication operations here:\n\n4 * 7 = 28\n2 * 3 = 6\n\nWe substitute those back into the expression:\n28 + 12 - 6\n\nNow, we only have addition and subtraction left. According to the rules, we go from left to right:\n\n28 + 12 = 40\n40 - 6 = 34\n\nSo, the final answer is 34.\n\nThe answer is 34."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400", "model": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 400, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in grade 6 learning order of operations for the first time.\n                    Explain your solution to this given Mathematics problem, and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "5+3*2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: In mathematics, we use the order of operations to determine in what order we should solve parts of an expression. The order of operations can be remembered using the acronym PEMDAS:\n\nP: Parentheses first\nE: Exponents (i.e. powers and square roots, etc.)\nMD: Multiplication and Division (from left to right)\nAS: Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)\n\nFor the expression 5 + 3 * 2, there are no parentheses or exponents to deal with, so we move to multiplication.\n\nAccording to our order of operations, we do the multiplication before the addition. So we multiply 3 by 2 first.\n\n3 * 2 = 6\n\nNow we take that result and add it to 5:\n\n5 + 6 = 11\n\nSo the final answer is 11. \n\nThe answer is 11."}]}]
