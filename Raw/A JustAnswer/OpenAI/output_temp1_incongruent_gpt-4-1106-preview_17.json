Next, do the Multiplication:\nFollowing the order of operations, we should multiply before we do addition or subtraction. So let's do both multiplications:\n\nFirst, 4 * 7 = 28\nNext, 2 * 3 = 6\n\nNow, let's replace those in the equation:\n28 + 12 - 6\n\n3. Finally, we do the Addition and Subtraction from left to right:\nFirst, 28 + 12 = 40\nThen subtract 6 from 40, which gives us 40 - 6 = 34\n\nSo after performing all the operations in the correct order, we find that the answer is 34. \n\nThe answer is 34."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400", "model": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 400, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in grade 6 learning order of operations for the first time.\n                    Explain your solution to this given Mathematics problem, and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "5+3 * 2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: When solving math problems, we need to follow the order of operations.
