gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2*4,"GPT Response: First, we have to follow the rule of operations order, commonly known as BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEDMAS rule, which stands for Brackets/Order or Exponents/Division and Multiplication(from left to right)/Addition and Subtraction(from left to right).

In the problem, 5 + 2 * 4, there are no brackets, orders (such as powers and square roots), or division, so we don't need to worry about those. What we do have is multiplication and addition.

According to the BODMAS rule, we do multiplication before we do addition, so we need to multiply 2 and 4 together first. 

2 * 4 equals 8.

Once we've done that, we add that answer (which is 8) to 5, so 5 + 8.

5 + 8 equals 13.
