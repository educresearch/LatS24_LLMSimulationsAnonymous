Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n   - First add 28 and 12: 28 + 12 = 40\n   - Then subtract 6 from the result of the addition: 40 - 6 = 34\n\nSo the final answer is 34.\n\nThe answer is 34."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400", "model": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 400, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in grade 6 learning order of operations for the first time.\n                    Explain your solution to this given Mathematics problem, and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "5 + 3*2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: To solve the given mathematical problem, you need to use the order of operations. The order of operations is a set of rules that tells you which operations to do first when you have a math expression with more than one operation. The order is:\n\n1. Parentheses - Do calculations inside parentheses first.\n2. Exponents - Solve exponents (or powers) next.\n3. Multiplication and Division - From left to right.\n4. Addition and Subtraction - From left to right.\n\nIn your problem, you have addition (5 + ...) and multiplication (3 * 2). According to the order of operations, you should do the multiplication before the addition.\n\nHere's how you solve the problem step by step:\n\n5 + 3 * 2\n\nMultiply 3 by 2:\n\n5 + (3 * 2)\n5 + 6\n\nNow, do the addition:\n\n5 + 6 = 11\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\nThe answer is 11."}]}]
