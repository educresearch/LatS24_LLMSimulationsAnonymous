This stands for Brackets, Indices or Exponents, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Our problem is 5 + 3 * 2. According to the order of operations, we do multiplication before addition. 

So, we first multiply 3 * 2, which equals 6.

Then we add 5 + 6, which equals 11.

The answer is 11."
