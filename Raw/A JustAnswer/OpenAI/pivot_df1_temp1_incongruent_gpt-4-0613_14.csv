gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: In Mathematics, we follow the BIDMAS/BODMAS rule which stands for Brackets, Indices/Orders, Division/Multiplication (from left to right), Addition/Subtraction (from left to right).

Given the equation:

4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3

First, we solve within the brackets (2+5) which equals to 7.

So, the equation becomes:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3 

Then, we perform the multiplication operation (4 * 7) and the (2 * 3) operation which are 28 and 6 respectively. 

So, the equation now becomes:

28 + 12 - 6

From there, we simply follow the order of operations from left to right. 

So, the equation now becomes 40 - 6 equals to 34.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: In order of operations, we follow the rule of BIDMAS/BODMAS:

B - Bracket
I - Indices or O - Order (Powers, square roots, etc.)
D/M - Division and Multiplication (from left to right)
A/S - Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Here in the given expression, 4 * 3+2, according to the BODMAS rule, we have no brackets or orders. So, we move on to multiplication and division. There's a multiplication operation in our expression so we do that first.

4 * 3 = 12

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: In mathematics, we use a rule called ""Order of Operations"". The order of operations is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This rule is also known by its acronym PEMDAS (or BODMAS which includes Brackets and Orders). So, when we solve a mathematical equation, we follow this order.

Now let's solve 5+3 * 2.

The operations in the given problem are addition and multiplication. According to PEMDAS/BODMAS rule, multiplication comes before addition. So, we'll perform the multiplication before we perform the addition.

First, let's perform 3 * 2 which equals 6.

Then, we will add the result to 5:

5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, you need to follow the order of operations, which in mathematics is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

The problem here is 5 + 2 * 4. There are no Parentheses or Exponents. BUT, there is a Multiplication step and an Addition step. 

According to PEMDAS, you have to do the Multiplication part first before the Addition. So first you multiply 2 and 4 together which equals to 8.

Therefore, now the problem is 5 + 8 (From the multiplication step 2*4 = 8)

Now, you just add those two numbers together.

5 + 8 equals 13.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: The problem is 7 * 2 + 8 * 5. 

Let's break this down. 

The first thing I need to do is follow the order of operations, which is also known as BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEDMAS. It means you need to solve things in this order: Brackets/Order(or Exponents)/Division/Multiplication/Addition/Subtraction. 

Now since this problem has only multiplication and addition operations, you have to multiply before you add, according to the order of operations.

So, first I will do the multiplication operations. That gives me:

7 * 2 = 14 and
8 * 5 = 40

Then I'll add these two results together:

14 (which is the result from 7 * 2) +  40 (which is the result from 8 * 5) = 54

So, the answer is 54."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, you need to follow the order of operations, which in mathematics is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

The problem you're given is 4 * 3 + 2. There are no parentheses or exponents in this problem, so you start with multiplication and division. 

In this case, the multiplication between 4 and 3 happens first, giving a result of 12.

Now, you rewrite the equation with the result of the multiplication included: 12 + 2.

This leaves only the addition operation to be carried out. 

Add 12 and 2 together, and you get 14. 

So, after following the correct order of operations, you have arrived at your final answer.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, we have to do the operation inside the parentheses, so we do 2+5 which gives us 7.

So now, our equation looks like: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, we have to do the multiplication, so we calculate 4 * 7 to get 28 and 2 * 3 to get 6.

Then, our equation becomes: 28 + 12 - 6.

After this, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So, we do 28 + 12 which gives us 40, and then subtract 6 from 40, which gives us 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, you need to follow the order of operations, which in mathematics is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

The problem here is 5 + 3 * 2. There are no Parentheses or Exponents. BUT, there is a Multiplication step and an Addition step. 

According to PEMDAS, you have to do the Multiplication part first before the Addition. So first you multiply 3 * 2, which equals to 6.

Now, you can add the result to 5. So it's 5 + 6, which equals to 11.

The answer is 11."
