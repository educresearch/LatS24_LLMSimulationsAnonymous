However, in this problem, we don't have any parentheses. <br><br>Next, we do the multiplication and division from left to right. Here, we have two multiplication operations: 4*(2+5) and 2*3. <br><br>But, in the first multiplication operation there is an addition operation involved, which we perform before multiplying: <br>2 + 5 equals 7 <br><br>Then multiplying 4 with this result, we get:<br>4 * 7 equals 28 <br><br>Then in the second multiplication operation 2*3, we get:<br>2 * 3 equals 6 <br><br>So the calculation now becomes 28+12-6.<br><br>Finally, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.
