So, we can solve ""3 times 2"" to get 6 first. 

That turns our problem into ""5 + 6"". 

Now, we do the addition next, because according the order of operations, we should perform addition after we finish all the operations like multiplication or division. 

So, we solve ""5 + 6"" to get 11. 

So, the answer to the problem ""5 + 3*2"" is 11.

The answer is 11."
