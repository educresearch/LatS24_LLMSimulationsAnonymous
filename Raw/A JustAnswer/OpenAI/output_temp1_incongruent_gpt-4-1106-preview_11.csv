So, after performing the operations correctly, the final answer is 14.

The answer is 14."

P - Parentheses first
E - Exponents (powers and square roots, etc.)
MD - Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS - Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

Let's solve the given problem step by step:

4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3

First, solve the parentheses:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, perform the multiplication:
28 + 12 - 6

Then, do the addition and subtraction from left to right:
40 - 6

Finally, subtract:
34

So, the answer is 34."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this math problem, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations is usually remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for:

- Parentheses
- Exponents (including roots, such as square roots)
- Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
- Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

This problem does not have parentheses, exponents, division, or subtraction, so we just need to focus on multiplication and addition.

The problem is: 5 + 3 * 2

According to PEMDAS, we should do the multiplication before the addition. So we first multiply 3 by 2.

3 * 2 = 6

Now, we add this result to 5:

5 + 6 = 11

So the final answer is 11.

The answer is 11."
