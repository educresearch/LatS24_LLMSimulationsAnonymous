systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-1106_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the rules of the order of operations. The order of operations is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).

Given the expression 5 + 3*2, we first perform the multiplication. 
3*2 equals 6. 

So the expression becomes 5 + 6. 
Now, we can add 5 and 6 together. 
5 + 6 equals 11. 

Therefore, the answer is 11."
