systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this math problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which in mathematics is often abbreviated as PEMDAS:

P - Parentheses
E - Exponents (i.e., powers and square roots, etc.)
MD - Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
AS - Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Now let's apply this to the problem:

1. Start with parentheses:
   4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3
   Inside the parentheses, we perform the addition: 2 + 5 = 7

2. Now our expression looks like this, with no parentheses left:
   4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

3. Next, we handle the multiplication:
   First multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28
   Second multiplication: 2 * 3 = 6

4. Our expression now looks like this:
   28 + 12 - 6

5. Finally, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:
   Addition: 28 + 12 = 40
   Subtraction: 40 - 6 = 34

Putting it all together, the expression simplifies to 34. So, the final answer is:

The answer is 34."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: In mathematics, the order of operations is a set of rules that reflects conventions about which procedures to perform first in order to evaluate a given mathematical expression. One common acronym used to remember the order of operations is PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

According to these rules, you need to perform multiplication before you do addition.

Here’s how you would solve the problem step-by-step:

1. Solve the multiplication part of the equation first.
   
   3 * 2 = 6

2. Then, add the result of the multiplication to 5.

   5 + 6 = 11

So, after following the order of operations, the final answer is:

The answer is 11."
