gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 4*(2+5)+12-2*3, we follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

First, work inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.
Then, perform the multiplication and division operations from left to right: 4*7 = 28 and 2*3 = 6.
Finally, perform the remaining addition and subtraction operations: 28 + 12 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this expression, we should follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and then addition and subtraction (from left to right).

First, we need to resolve what's in the parentheses:
