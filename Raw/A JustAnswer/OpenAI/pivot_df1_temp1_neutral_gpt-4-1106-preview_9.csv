gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Alright, let's solve the problem by following the order of operations. In mathematics, we use the order of operations to solve equations like this, and we often remember this order with the acronym PEMDAS:

P: Parentheses first
E: Exponents (i.e. powers and square roots, etc.)
MD: Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS: Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

Our problem doesn't have any exponents, so we can skip that step. Now, let's apply the order of operations:

1. Parentheses first:
   We need to do the operation inside the parentheses: (2+5)

   4*(2+5) + 12 - 2*3

   Inside the parentheses, 2+5 equals 7, so we can replace that:

   4*7 + 12 - 2*3

2. Multiplication and Division next:
   We have two multiplication operations: 4*7 and 2*3

   Multiplying 4 by 7 gives us 28, and multiplying 2 by 3 gives us 6, so replace those:

   28 + 12 - 6

3. Addition and Subtraction last:
   We only have addition and subtraction left, so we will perform these operations from left to right.

   First we'll add 28 and 12, which equals 40:

   40 - 6

   Now we'll subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34:

   34

Therefore, the answer is 34."

Next, we do multiplication and division from left to right. There's no division here, but there are two multiplication operations:

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now our expression looks like this:

28 + 12 - 6
