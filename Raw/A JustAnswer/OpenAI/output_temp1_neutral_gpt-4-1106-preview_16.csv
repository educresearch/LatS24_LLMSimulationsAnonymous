systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Alright, let's solve this step by step. We are going to use the order of operations which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:

P - Parentheses first
E - Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
MD - Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS - Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

Now, let's apply these rules to the problem:
4*(2+5)+12-2*3

First, we handle the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

Now substitute that back into the expression:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we move onto multiplication and division, from left to right. There are two multiplication operations here:

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

We substitute those back into the expression:
28 + 12 - 6

Now, we only have addition and subtraction left. According to the rules, we go from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So, the final answer is 34.

The answer is 34."

The order of operations can be remembered using the acronym PEMDAS:

P: Parentheses first
E: Exponents (i.e. powers and square roots, etc.)
MD: Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
AS: Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

For the expression 5 + 3 * 2, there are no parentheses or exponents to deal with, so we move to multiplication.

According to our order of operations, we do the multiplication before the addition. So we multiply 3 by 2 first.

3 * 2 = 6

Now we take that result and add it to 5:

5 + 6 = 11

So the final answer is 11. 

The answer is 11."
