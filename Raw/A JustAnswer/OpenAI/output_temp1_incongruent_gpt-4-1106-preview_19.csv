systemPrompt4_userPrompt3_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematical problem, we need to use the order of operations. The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us the sequence in which we should solve different parts of a math problem. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember this order:

P: Parentheses first
E: Exponents (i.e. powers and square roots, etc.)
MD: Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS: Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

In the problem ""4 * 3 + 2"", we have multiplication (4 * 3) and addition (+ 2). According to PEMDAS, we need to perform the multiplication before the addition because multiplication comes before addition in the list of operations.

First, we multiply 4 by 3:
4 * 3 = 12

Next, we add 2 to the result of the multiplication:
12 + 2 = 14

Therefore, the final answer is:
The answer is 14."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this mathematical expression, we'll use the order of operations, which is commonly remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply these steps to the given expression:

4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3

First, we'll do the operation inside the parentheses:

(2 + 5) = 7

Now, the expression looks like this: 

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we'll perform the multiplication operations, because multiplication comes before addition and subtraction:

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

So the expression now looks like:

28 + 12 - 6

Then, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 34."

There are no parentheses or exponents to deal with in this problem, so we move on to multiplication and division. We must do these operations before addition and subtraction.

Here's the problem: 5 + 3 * 2
According to the order of operations, we need to do the multiplication first:

3 * 2 = 6

Now we can add that result to 5:

5 + 6 = 11

So, after doing the multiplication and then the addition, the final answer is:

The answer is 11."
