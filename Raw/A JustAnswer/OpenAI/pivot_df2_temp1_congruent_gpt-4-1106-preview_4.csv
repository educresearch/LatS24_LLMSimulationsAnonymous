gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, we will follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS meaning Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Start by evaluating the expression inside the parentheses:

2 + 5 = 7

Now, the expression becomes:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, perform the multiplication operations:

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now the expression is:

28 + 12 - 6

After that, let's perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40

Now we have:

40 - 6

Lastly, perform the subtraction:

40 - 6 = 34

So the final answer is:

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Let's break down the expression step by step using the order of operations, which follows the BIDMAS/BODMAS principle: Brackets, Indices/Orders (i.e. powers and roots), Division and Multiplication (left-to-right), and Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right).

1. Calculate inside the brackets first: (2 + 5) = 7
2. The expression now becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

3. Then, we perform the multiplication:
   a. 4 * 7 = 28
   b. 2 * 3 = 6
Now, the expression looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

4. Next, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:
   a. 28 + 12 = 40
   b. 40 - 6 = 34

Thus, the final answer is 34. To put this into the requested format:

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:

P: Parentheses first
E: Exponents (i.e. powers and square roots, etc.)
MD: Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
AS: Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Now we'll apply these rules to the problem:

4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3

First, we solve the expression within the parentheses:

2 + 5 = 7

Now we substitute this back into the expression:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we handle the multiplication (since there are no exponents):

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Putting these results back into the expression:

28 + 12 - 6

Now we move left to right with the addition and subtraction:

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So the final answer is:

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve the problem with the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)), we'll tackle it step by step:

1. **Parentheses**: We solve any operations inside parentheses first.
2. **Exponents**: Next, we would solve exponents (squares, cubes, etc.), but there are none in this problem.
3. **Multiplication/Division**: We do these next, going from left to right.
4. **Addition/Subtraction**: Finally, we do addition and subtraction, also from left to right.

The expression is: 4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3

Following the order of operations:

1. **Solve inside the parentheses (2 + 5):**
   4 * (2 + 5) becomes 4 * 7

2. **Perform the multiplications:**
   First, the multiplication 4 * 7:
   4 * 7 = 28

   Then the multiplication 2 * 3:
   2 * 3 = 6

   Now, our expression looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

3. **Perform the addition and subtraction (from left to right):**
   First, add 28 + 12:
   28 + 12 = 40

   Then subtract 6 from the result:
   40 - 6 = 34

So, the final answer is 34.
