      <td>GPT Response: First, we need to look at our order of operations acronym BIDMAS which stands for Brackets, Indices, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>So according to BIDMAS, we need to solve what's inside brackets first. The expression inside brackets is (2+5) which equals 7.<br><br>We then replace (2+5) with 7 in the expression: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next in line with BIDMAS is multiplication, and there are two multiplication operations in this expression. We must complete these calculations from left to right. <br><br>First, we calculate 4 * 7, which equals 28. Replace 4*7 with 28, and the expression becomes 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Then we calculate 2 * 3 which equals 6. Replace 2*3 with 6 in the expression, and it becomes 28 + 12 - 6. <br><br>Now we're left with only addition and subtraction operations. We go from left to right again.<br><br>First, we calculate 28 + 12, which equals 40.
