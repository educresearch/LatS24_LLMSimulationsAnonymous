gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Let's solve the given mathematical expression step by step following the order of operations, commonly known as PEMDAS/BODMAS (Parentheses/Brackets, Orders or Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).

The given problem is:
4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3

Step 1: Parentheses (2+5)
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Step 2: Multiplication
(4 * 7) = 28
(2 * 3) = 6
Now, replace these into the equation:
28 + 12 - 6

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

Therefore, after following the order of operations, we get the final answer:
The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we will follow the order of operations often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Here's the problem with each operation applied in the correct order:

1. Parentheses:
4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3
= 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

2. Multiplication (and division, if any, but there's none here):
= 28 + 12 - 6

3. Addition and subtraction (from left to right):
= 40 - 6
= 34

The final answer is 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve the math problem 4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3, you should follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS/BODMAS:

1. Parentheses/Brackets
2. Exponents/Orders (like square roots, cube roots etc.)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's solve it step-by-step:

First, solve the parentheses (2+5):
4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3
= 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, do the multiplication:
(4 * 7) = 28
(2 * 3) = 6

So the expression now looks like:
28 + 12 - 6

Then, do the addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40

Now subtract 6 from 40:
40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this math problem, we need to use the order of operations, which is often abbreviated as PEMDAS:

P – Parentheses first
E – Exponents (i.e., powers and square roots, etc.)
MD – Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS – Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

Following this order, we first deal with the parentheses, then do multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right.

So let's solve this step by step:

Step 1: Solve the parentheses (2+5)
4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3
= 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Step 2: Multiplication and Division from left to right
First Multiplication: 4 * 7
= 28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Second Multiplication: 2 * 3
= 28 + 12 - 6

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction from left to right
First Addition: 28 + 12
= 40 - 6

Then Subtraction: 40 - 6
= 34

Putting it all together, after following the order of operations, we get the final answer:

The answer is 34."
