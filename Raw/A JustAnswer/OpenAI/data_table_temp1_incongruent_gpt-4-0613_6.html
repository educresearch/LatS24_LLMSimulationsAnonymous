      <td>GPT Response: In order to solve this problem, we must follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS or BODMAS.<br><br>Here is the problem broken down:<br><br>1. 4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Start with the operation inside the parentheses: <br><br>2. 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3 <br><br>Next, perform the multiplication operations:<br><br>3. 28 + 12 - 6 <br><br>Finally, perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right:<br><br>4. 40 - 6 <br><br>5. 34<br><br>So, the solution to the problem 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3, following the order of operations, is 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, you should always start with the operations in the brackets (parentheses) because of the BIDMAS/BODMAS rule which stands for Brackets, Indices, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). So here, the expression in the brackets is 2 + 5, which adds up to 7. The equation then becomes:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, you should do the multiplication (another part of BIDMAS/BODMAS rule). So, you multiply 4 with 7 to get 28, and 2 with 3 to get 6. This results in:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Finally, you should do the addition and then subtraction. So, 28 + 12 gives you 40 and then you subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
