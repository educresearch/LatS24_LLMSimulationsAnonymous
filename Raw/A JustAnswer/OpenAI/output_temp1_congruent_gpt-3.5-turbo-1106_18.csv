systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-1106_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this math problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).

First, we look for any parentheses or exponents, but there are none in this problem. 

Next, we perform the multiplication. 

3 * 2 = 6

Now we can add the result of the multiplication to 5.

5 + 6 = 11

So, the final answer is 11. 
Therefore, the answer is 11."
