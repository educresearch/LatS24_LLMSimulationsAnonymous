gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Let's solve this using the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS): parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).

1. Parentheses (2+5) = 7
2. Multiplication 
    a. 4 * 7 = 28
    b. 2 * 3 = 6
3. Addition and subtraction, from left to right, 
    a. 28 + 12 = 40
    b. 40 - 6 = 34

Putting it together:

4*(2+5)+12-2*3 
= 4*7 + 12 - 2*3 
= 28 + 12 - 6 
= 40 - 6 
= 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction). Start with any calculations inside parentheses.

First calculate what's inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

Now substitute this back into the expression:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, perform the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now the expression simplifies to:
28 + 12 - 6

Then, do the addition and subtraction from left to right:
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

The final answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this mathematics problem, you need to follow the order of operations. In mathematics, the order of operations is commonly remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for:

Using the order of operations, let's solve the given problem:

4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3

First, solve the expression within the parentheses:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, perform the multiplication:

28 + 12 - 6

Now, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:

40 - 6

Lastly, subtract:

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: In mathematics, we use the order of operations to solve problems like this. The order of operations can be remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:

- Parentheses (P)
- Exponents (E)
- Multiplication and Division (MD) from left to right
- Addition and Subtraction (AS) from left to right

For the given mathematics problem, we apply the order of operations as follows:

First, we solve the expression inside the parentheses:

4*(2+5) + 12 - 2*3

Now, we evaluate inside the parentheses (2+5):

4*7 + 12 - 2*3

Second, we perform the multiplication operations (since there are no exponents in this problem):

(4*7) is 28 
(2*3) is 6

So we have:

28 + 12 - 6

Third, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 is 40
Then 40 - 6 is 34
