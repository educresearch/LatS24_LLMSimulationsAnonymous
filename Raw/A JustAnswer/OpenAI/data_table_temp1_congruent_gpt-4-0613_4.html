      <td>GPT Response: First, you need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>In the given calculation, you first perform the operation within the parentheses:<br><br>4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3<br>= 4*(7) + 12 - 2*3<br><br>Then you perform multiplication:<br><br>= 28 + 12 - 2*3<br><br>= 28 + 12 - 6<br><br>And lastly perform addition and subtraction from left to right:<br><br>= 40 - 6<br>= 34<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, apply the order of operations - parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), addition and subtraction (from left to right). This rule is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.<br><br>In the given problem, first complete the operation inside the parentheses (2+5) to get 7. <br><br>The equation becomes: 4*7 + 12 - 2*3<br><br>Then, you solve the multiplication: 4*7 = 28 and 2*3 = 6. <br><br>This makes the equation: 28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Finally, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40, then 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we follow the parentheses rule which states that we must deal with expressions inside parentheses and brackets first. Here, we have (2 + 5) which gives 7.<br><br>So, the equation becomes: <br>4*7 + 12 - 2*3<br><br>Second, we follow the multiplication rule (also part of the order of operations along with division) which states we must multiply before we add or subtract. Here, we multiply 4*7 to get 28 and 2*3 to get 6:<br><br>This changes our equation to: <br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Finally, we follow the addition and subtraction rule (the last part of the order of operations) which states we must add or subtract (from left to right).<br>Adding 28 and 12 gives 40. Subtracting 6 from 40 gives 34. <br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: The first thing that we need to do is obey the order of operations, which is usually remembered by the acronym<br>PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>Looking at the equation 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3, we start with the operation in the parentheses. So we calculate 2 + 5, which equals 7. Then, we substitute 7 for (2 + 5) in our equation, which now reads as: 4*7 + 12 - 2*3.<br><br>Our next step is to perform the multiplication operations. So we calculate 4*7 and 2*3, which are 28 and 6 respectively. The equation then reads as: 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Finally, we apply the last part of the order of operations, which is addition and subtraction from left to right. So, we calculate 28 + 12 and then subtract 6 from the result. The equation is calculated as follows: <br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So, the final answer is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
