gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Let's solve the expression step by step using the order of operations (parentheses first, then multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right):

Expression: 4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3

First, we solve the operation inside the parentheses:

(2 + 5) = 7

Now, our expression looks like this:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we perform the multiplication:

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

The expression now is:

28 + 12 - 6

Then we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40

So now we have:

40 - 6

Finally:

40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we will follow the order of operations, often remembered by the mnemonic PEMDAS:

P – Parentheses first
E – Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
MD – Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS – Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

Given the expression: 4*(2+5)+12-2*3, let's solve it step by step:

1. Parentheses first:
Calculate the expression inside the parentheses (2+5) which equals 7.

2. Multiplication and Division (left-to-right):
Now we have 4*7, which equals 28, and also we have 2*3, which equals 6. So we replace those in the expression:
28 + 12 - 6

3. Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right):
Finally, we simply add and subtract in the sequence they appear:
28 + 12 = 40
And then,
40 - 6 = 34

Therefore, the result of the expression is 34. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this Mathematics problem, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Let's solve the problem step by step following the order of operations:

1. Parentheses: First we solve any operations inside parentheses.
   In the expression 4*(2+5)+12-2*3, we have (2+5). We add 2 and 5 to get 7.

   So now we have: 4*7+12-2*3

2. Multiplication and Division: Next, we perform all multiplications and divisions from left to right.
   We have two multiplications here: 4*7 and 2*3.

   4*7 = 28
   2*3 = 6
   
   Now our expression looks like this: 28+12-6

3. Addition and Subtraction: Finally, we perform all additions and subtractions from left to right.
   We add 28 and 12 to get 40, then subtract 6 from 40.

   28+12 = 40
   40-6 = 34

So, the final answer to the expression is 34.

P: Parentheses first
E: Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
MD: Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
AS: Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply this to the problem step by step:

1. First, we deal with the parentheses (2+5):
4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3

Inside the parentheses, the sum of 2 and 5 is 7. Now the equation looks like this:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

2. Second, we do the multiplication operations:
We have two multiplication operations: 4 * 7 and 2 * 3.

4 * 7 is 28 and 2 * 3 is 6. Now our equation is looking like:
28 + 12 - 6

3. Third, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:
28 + 12 = 40
Then we subtract 6 from 40:
40 - 6 = 34

And that gives us our final answer. The answer is 34."
