systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, you need to follow the order of operations, which in mathematics is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

The problem here is 5 + 3*2. According to PEMDAS, you should do the multiplication before the addition. 

So, we first multiply 3*2 which equals to 6.

Next, we add that result to the 5. 

So, 5 + 6 equals to 11. 

The answer is 11."
