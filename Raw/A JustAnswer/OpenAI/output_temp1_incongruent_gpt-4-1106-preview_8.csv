In mathematics, the order of operations is usually remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). The order of operations tells us which operations to perform first in a mathematical expression.

For the expression you provided, which is:

4 * 3 + 2

We can see that there are no parentheses or exponents, so we move on to multiplication and division:

First, we do the multiplication before the addition:

4 * 3 = 12

Now, we add the result to 2:

12 + 2 = 14

So the final answer is:

The answer is 14."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Let's solve this mathematics problem step by step, following the order of operations. In mathematics, we use the acronym PEMDAS to remember the order:

- P: Parentheses first
- E: Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
- MD: Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
- AS: Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

Let's apply it to the problem:

4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3

First, we start with anything inside parentheses:

(2+5) = 7

Now we can replace that in the expression:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we do the multiplication (since there are no exponents in this expression):

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now we replace those results back into the expression:

28 + 12 - 6

Now, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So the final answer is:

The answer is 34."

When you have an expression with more than one operation, you need to perform them in a specific order. The acronym PEMDAS can help you remember the order:

P: Parentheses first
E: Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
MD: Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS: Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

For the given expression, 5 + 3 * 2:

1. You see that there are no parentheses or exponents to deal with, so you move on to multiplication and division.
2. Multiply 3 by 2 to get 6.
3. Now you have 5 + 6.
4. Finally, add 5 to 6 to get 11.

The answer is 11."
