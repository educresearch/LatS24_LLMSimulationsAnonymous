Parentheses: First we solve any operations inside parentheses.<br>   In the expression 4*(2+5)+12-2*3, we have (2+5). We add 2 and 5 to get 7.<br><br>   So now we have: 4*7+12-2*3<br><br>2.

Addition and Subtraction: Finally, we perform all additions and subtractions from left to right.<br>   We add 28 and 12 to get 40, then subtract 6 from 40.<br><br>   28+12 = 40<br>   40-6 = 34<br><br>So, the final answer to the expression is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

First, we deal with the parentheses (2+5):<br>4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Inside the parentheses, the sum of 2 and 5 is 7. Now the equation looks like this:<br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>2.
