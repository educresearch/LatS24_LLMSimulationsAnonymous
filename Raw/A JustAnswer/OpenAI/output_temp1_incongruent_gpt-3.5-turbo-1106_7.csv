systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-1106_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to use the order of operations. The order of operations tells us to perform multiplication and division before addition and subtraction.

So, for the given problem, we first need to perform the multiplication 3 * 2, which equals 6. Then, we add 5 to the result of the multiplication to get the final answer.

Therefore, 5 + 3 * 2 = 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11."
