gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we use the order of operations (PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).

First, we solve the operations inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

Now we have:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we perform the multiplications:
4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now we have:
28 + 12 - 6

Now we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this expression, we'll follow the order of operations: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right) - also known as PEMDAS. 

Starting from the innermost parentheses:
4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3
= 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3
= 28 + 12 - 6
= 40 - 6
= 34

So the final answer is 34.
