systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-1106_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.

In this expression, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we move on to multiplication and division. We have 3 * 2, which equals 6.

Now we can add the 5 to the result of the multiplication, which gives us 11.

So, the answer is 11."
