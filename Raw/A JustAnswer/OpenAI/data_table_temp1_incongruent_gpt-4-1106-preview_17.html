      <td>GPT Response: Okay, I'm happy to help with your math problem! When solving math equations, it's important to follow the 'order of operations'. The order of operations can be remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>Let's solve the problem step by step:<br><br>The original problem is:<br>4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>1. Parentheses first:<br>Inside the parentheses, we have 2+5. Let's solve that first:<br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now replace the (2+5) with 7 in the equation:<br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>2. Next, do the Multiplication:<br>Following the order of operations, we should multiply before we do addition or subtraction. So let's do both multiplications:<br><br>First, 4 * 7 = 28<br>Next, 2 * 3 = 6<br><br>Now, let's replace those in the equation:<br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>3. Finally, we do the Addition and Subtraction from left to right:<br>First, 28 + 12 = 40<br>Then subtract 6 from 40, which gives us 40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So after performing all the operations in the correct order, we find that the answer is 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
