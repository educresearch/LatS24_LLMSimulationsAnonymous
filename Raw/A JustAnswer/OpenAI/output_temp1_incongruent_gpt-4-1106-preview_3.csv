systemPrompt4_userPrompt3_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this mathematical problem, we will use the order of operations. The order of operations in mathematics tells us the sequence in which we should solve different parts of a math problem. The standard order of operations can be remembered using the acronym PEMDAS:

P - Parentheses first
E - Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
MD - Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS - Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

For the given problem 4 * 3 + 2, there are no parentheses, exponents, or division involved, so we'll focus on multiplication and then addition.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Start with multiplication since it comes before addition in the order of operations:
   
   4 * 3 = 12

2. Now, take the result from the multiplication and add the remaining number:

   12 + 2 = 14

Therefore, when we follow the order of operations, we find that 4 times 3 plus 2 equals 14.

The answer is 14."

P - Parentheses first
E - Exponents (i.e., powers and square roots, etc.)
MD - Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS - Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

Now, let's apply PEMDAS to your problem:

4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3

First, we'll do operations inside the parentheses:

(2+5)

This equals 7. Now we substitute this back into the expression:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

There are no exponents, so we move on to the next step, multiplication and division:

First multiplication: 4 * 7 equals 28.

Second multiplication: 2 * 3 equals 6.

The expression now simplifies to:

28 + 12 - 6

Finally, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:

First we add 28 and 12, which equals 40:

40 - 6

And then we subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34.

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 34."

The order of operations in mathematics tells us the sequence in which we should solve different parts of a math problem. The standard order of operations can be remembered using the acronym PEMDAS:

P - Parentheses
E - Exponents (or indices)
M - Multiplication
D - Division
A - Addition
S - Subtraction

According to PEMDAS, multiplication comes before addition. So you must first multiply 3 by 2, and then add the result to 5.

Here's how you do it step by step:

1. Start with the original problem:
   5 + 3 * 2

2. Perform multiplication first:
   3 * 2 = 6

3. Now add the result to 5:
   5 + 6 = 11

Therefore, we did the multiplication first and then the addition to get the final answer.

The answer is 11."
