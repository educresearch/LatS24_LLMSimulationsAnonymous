gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression, we follow the order of operations: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So, first we solve inside the parentheses:
4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3
= 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3
= 28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Then we do the multiplications and subtractions in order:
= 28 + 12 - 6
= 40 - 6
= 34

So the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this expression, we'll first simplify the expression inside the parentheses, then apply the multiplication and addition operations in the correct order.

Start by evaluating the expression inside the parentheses:

2 + 5 = 7

Now the expression becomes:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, apply the multiplication operations:

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now the expression becomes:

28 + 12 - 6

Finally, apply the addition and subtraction operations:

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to use the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

1. First, we solve inside the parentheses:
   2 + 5 = 7

2. Then, we perform the multiplication:
   4 * 7 = 28

3. Next, we solve the remaining addition and subtraction from left to right:
   28 + 12 - 2 * 3
   = 40 - 2 * 3
   = 40 - 6
   = 34

So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS. 

First, we perform operations inside the parentheses. 
Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5 which equals 7. 

Now, the expression becomes 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. 

Next, we perform the multiplication operations, working from left to right. 
4 * 7 equals 28 and 2 * 3 equals 6. 

The expression becomes 28 + 12 - 6. 

Finally, we perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right. 
28 + 12 equals 40 and 40 - 6 equals 34. 

So, the final answer is 34. 

Therefore, the answer is 34."
