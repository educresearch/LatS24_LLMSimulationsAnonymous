gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, we follow the order of operations: parentheses, multiplication, and addition/subtraction. 

Step 1: Start with the operations inside the parentheses.
2 + 5 = 7

Step 2: Then multiply 4 by the result of the addition within the parentheses.
4 * 7 = 28

Step 3: Next multiply 2 by 3.
2 * 3 = 6

Step 4: Add and subtract according to their order.
28 + 12 - 6 = 34
