      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we follow the order of operations (also known as PEMDAS). <br><br>First, we perform any calculations inside parentheses. In this case, the expression inside the parentheses is 2 + 5, which equals 7. <br><br>Next, we perform any multiplication and division from left to right. In this case, there are two multiplications: 4 * 7 and 2 * 3. <br><br>So, 4 * 7 equals 28 and 2 * 3 equals 6. <br><br>Next, we perform any addition and subtraction from left to right. In this case, there are two additions: 28 + 6 and 12. <br><br>So, 28 + 6 equals 34, and then we add 12, which equals 46. <br><br>Therefore, the final answer is 46.</td>
