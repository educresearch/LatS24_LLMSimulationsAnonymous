systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS. PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This helps us determine the order in which we should solve the different parts of the equation.

Let's break down the equation step by step:

1. Start by solving what's inside the parentheses:
   (2+5) = 7

2. Next, multiply 4 by the result we obtained in step 1:
   4 * 7 = 28

3. Moving on to the rest of the equation:
   28 + 12 - 2 * 3

4. Perform the multiplication first:
   2 * 3 = 6

5. Now, we can continue with the addition and subtraction in order from left to right:
   28 + 12 - 6

6. Add 28 and 12:
   40 - 6

7. Subtract 6 from 40:
   34

Therefore, the answer is 34."

The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us the order in which mathematical operations should be performed. 

The order of operations is as follows:
1. Parentheses ( )
2. Exponents or powers (such as squares or cubes)
3. Multiplication and division (from left to right)
4. Addition and subtraction (from left to right)

In our problem, we have the addition of 5 and the multiplication of 3 and 2. According to the order of operations, we need to perform the multiplication before the addition.

So, we can rewrite the expression as:

5+3*2 = 5 + 6

Now, we can perform the addition:

5 + 6 = 11

Therefore, the answer is 11."
