gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this expression, we follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS/BODMAS (Parentheses/Brackets, Orders (i.e., powers and square roots, etc.), Division and Multiplication (left-to-right), Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)).

Starting with the expression:

4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3

First, we do the operation inside the parentheses (2 + 5):

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we perform the multiplication operations:

28 + 12 - 6

Then we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:

40 - 6

Finally, we do the subtraction:

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Let's solve the mathematical expression step by step:

4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3

We will follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS/BODMAS (Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division (left-to-right), Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)).

First, we'll solve the parentheses:

2 + 5 = 7

Now we replace that in the expression:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next step is multiplication:

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Replace the multiplication results in the expression:

28 + 12 - 6

Then, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So the final answer is:

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve the problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:

P - Parentheses first
E - Exponents (i.e., powers and square roots, etc.)
MD - Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
AS - Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply the order of operations to your problem step by step:

1. Solve expressions inside parentheses first.
4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3 

Inside the parenthesis, we have (2 + 5), which equals 7.
So the expression becomes:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3 

2. Perform multiplication and division from left to right.
Now we can do the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now our expression looks like this:
28 + 12 - 6

3. Perform addition and subtraction from left to right.
First, add 28 and 12 to get 40:
40 - 6

And finally, subtract 6 from 40 to get 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve the math problem, you should follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS or BIDMAS, which stands for:

- Parentheses or Brackets
- Exponents or Indices
- Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
- Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's solve the problem step-by-step, following these rules:

1. First, deal with the parentheses (brackets):
   There is an operation inside brackets: (2+5)

   4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3

   Calculate what's inside brackets:
   
   4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

2. Then, do multiplication and division as they occur from left to right:
   There are two multiplications:
   
   First, do the multiplication of 4 by 7:
   
   28 + 12 - 2 * 3

   Then, do the multiplication of 2 by 3:
   
   28 + 12 - 6

3. Lastly, perform addition and subtraction from left to right:
   First, add 28 and 12:

   40 - 6
   
   Then subtract 6 from 40:

   34

So, after applying the order of operations, you get the final answer:
