      <td>GPT Response: This expression can be simplified by using the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>So firstly, we calculate the expression within the parentheses: (2 + 5) = 7.<br>Then, the expression becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Secondly, we do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6.<br>So, the equation will now be: 28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Finally, performing the addition and subtraction from left to right, we get: 28 + 12 = 40<br>and then, 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we should follow the order of operations, often remembered as BIDMAS or PEMDAS: parentheses (brackets), exponents (indices), division and multiplication (from left to right), addition and subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>The expression is 4*(2+5)+12-2*3.<br><br>First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses (2+5)=7.<br><br>So, we get 4*7+12-2*3.<br><br>Next, according to the order of operations, multiply 4*7 to get 28.<br><br>So, we get 28+12-2*3.<br><br>Continue with the multiplication operation because it has the same precedence level as division and should be solved from left to right if they appear together. Here:<br><br>2*3 is 6.<br><br>So, the equation now reads 28+12-6.<br><br>Finally, perform addition and subtraction in the order they appear from left to right. <br><br>So, 28+12=40.

      <td>GPT Response: First, we should apply the order of operations, also known as BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEDMAS which instructs that Brackets/Orders/Exponents, Division and Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction be carried out in that order.<br><br>So to start off, the problem simplifies to:<br><br>4*(7) + 12 - 2*3 <br><br>since 2 + 5 in the bracket equals 7.<br><br>Next, we multiply:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6 <br><br>because 4 * 7 equals 28, and 2 * 3 equals 6.<br><br>Finally, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:<br><br>40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>So:<br><br>4*(2+5) + 12 - 2*3 = 34<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
