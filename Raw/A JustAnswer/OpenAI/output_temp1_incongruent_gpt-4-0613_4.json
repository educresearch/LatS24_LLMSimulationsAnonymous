First, we come across the multiplication 4 * 7 = 28 and then 2 * 3 = 6, and the problem now becomes: 28 + 12 - 6.\n\nLastly, we proceed with Addition and Subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40 then we proceed to subtract 6 from 40, and we get 34.\n\nSo, the answer is 34."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400", "model": "gpt-4-0613", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 400, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in grade 6 learning order of operations for the first time.\n                    Explain your solution to this given Mathematics problem, and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "5+3 * 2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: Sure, I will solve this problem using the order of operations. This is also referred to as BIDMAS or BODMAS. The meaning and order of the operations are Brackets/Orders (Powers and Square Roots, etc.), Division and Multiplication (left-to-right), Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right).\n\nThe problem given is 5 + 3 * 2.\n\nFirst, we look for any items inside brackets, but in this problem, there aren't any. \n\nNext, there are orders like exponents or square roots, but we don't have any in this problem either.\n\nSo, we move to the next operation, which is multiplication and division from left to right. We have a multiplication operation in our problem, which is 3 times 2. The result of this is 6.\n\nOur problem now becomes 5 + 6.\n\nThe last operation, according to the order of operations, is addition and subtraction from left to right. We have an addition operation in our problem, which is 5 plus 6. The result of this is 11.\n\nSo, after following the order of operations, the solution to this problem is 11.\n\nThe answer is 11."}]}]
