1. First, solve the equation in the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7. So the equation becomes: 4*7 + 12 - 2*3.
2. Then, do multiplication: 

       4*7 = 28 and 2*3 = 6. The equation becomes: 28 + 12 - 6.
3. Lastly, perform addition and subtraction from left to right: 

       28 + 12 = 40 and then 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: The problem is 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3.

Firstly, solve the expression in the bracket which is (2 + 5). This equals 7.

Then, substitute (2 + 5) with 7. The problem then becomes 4*7 + 12 - 2*3.

Now, solve the products. 4*7 is 28 and 2*3 is 6. Substitute the products in the problem. The problem now becomes 28 + 12 - 6.

Finally, perform the addition and subtraction operations. 28 + 12 = 40 and 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: The problem given is: 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3

To solve this, we need to follow the order of operations, also known as BIDMAS or PEMDAS, which stand for Brackets/parentheses, Indices/Exponents, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Step 1: Solve the operation in brackets
4*(2 + 5) -> 4*7 = 28

So the equation now becomes: 28 + 12 - 2*3

Step 2: Next, perform the multiplication
2*3 = 6

So, the equation now becomes : 28 + 12 - 6

Step 3: Perform addition and subtraction from left to right:
First add: 28 + 12 = 40
Then subtract: 40 - 6 = 34

So the final answer is 34.
