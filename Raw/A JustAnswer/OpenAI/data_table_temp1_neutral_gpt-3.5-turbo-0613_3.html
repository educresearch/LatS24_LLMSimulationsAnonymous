      <td>GPT Response: To answer this question, we must follow the order of operations (also known as BIDMAS or PEMDAS). BIDMAS stands for Brackets, Indices (or exponents), Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>Let's break down the problem step by step:<br><br>1. Start by working inside the brackets: (2+5) = 7<br><br>2. Multiply 4 by the result of the brackets: 4*(7) = 28<br><br>3. Next, add 12 to the previous result: 28 + 12 = 40<br><br>4. Then, multiply 2 by 3: 2 * 3 = 6<br><br>5. Finally, subtract the result from step 4 from the result in step 3: 40 - 6 = 34<br><br>Therefore, the final answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us the sequence in which different mathematical operations should be performed.<br><br>According to the order of operations, we need to start by simplifying any operations inside parentheses or brackets. In this case, we have (2+5) inside parentheses. Adding 2 and 5, we get 7.<br><br>Next, we need to perform any multiplication or division from left to right. In this expression, we have 4 multiplied by (2+5). Multiplying 4 by 7, we get 28.<br><br>Now, we need to simplify any addition or subtraction from left to right. In this expression, we have 28 added to 12. Adding 28 and 12, we get 40.<br><br>Finally, we have to perform the last multiplication operation, which is 2 multiplied by 3. Multiplying 2 by 3, we get 6.<br><br>Therefore, the final answer is 40 minus 6, which is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
