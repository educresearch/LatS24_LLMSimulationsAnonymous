The expression is: 4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3

1. Solve the expression inside the parentheses first:
   (2+5) = 7

2. Now the expression becomes:
   4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

3. Next, perform multiplication operations from left to right:
   4 * 7 = 28
   2 * 3 = 6

4. Replace these products back into the expression:
   28 + 12 - 6

5. Finally, perform addition and subtraction from left to right:
   28 + 12 = 40
   40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve the given mathematical problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is commonly known by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).

The given problem is:
4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3

1. We start by solving the expression inside the parentheses (2+5):
4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3

2. Now we perform the multiplication operations:
4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6
So the expression becomes:
28 + 12 - 6

3. We then perform the addition:
28 + 12 = 40
So the expression becomes:
40 - 6

4. Finally, we subtract:
40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem correctly, you need to follow the order of operations, which can be remembered using the acronym PEMDAS:

P: Parentheses first
E: Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
MD: Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS: Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

According to PEMDAS, you solve anything in parentheses first, followed by exponents, then multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right.

Let's solve the given problem step by step:

4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3

First, solve inside the parentheses (P):

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Now there are no exponents to deal with, so we move on to multiplication and division (MD), which is done from left to right:

(4 * 7) + 12 - (2 * 3)
28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, we do addition and subtraction from left to right (AS):

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So, the final answer is 34.
