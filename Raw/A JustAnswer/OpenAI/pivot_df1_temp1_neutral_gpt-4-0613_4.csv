gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Order of operations, or PEMDAS/BEDMAS, is a rule in math for the sequence of operations. The meaning of the acronym are:

PEMDAS/BEDMAS:

P/B - Parentheses/Brackets (do any math that is inside parentheses/brackets first)
E/E - Exponents/Exponents (do any calculations involving exponents next)
MD/DM - Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
AS/AS - Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Looking at the problem, there are no parentheses or exponents. So, we move on to multiplication and division. 

First let's calculate 7*2, which equals 14.
Then we multiply 8*5, which equals 40.

Now, we have: 14 + 40.

The final operation is addition, so add the numbers derived from the multiplication together:

14 + 40 equals 54.

Thus, the answer is 54."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: In the order of operations, you have to follow the rule BIDMAS/BODMAS: 

Brackets/Orders (indices), Division/Multiplication (from left to right), Addition/Subtraction (from left to right).

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: In the order of operations, you have to do multiplication before you do addition. This rule is remembered by the acronym PEMDAS meaning Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). So, in the problem 5 + 3 * 2, you will do the multiplication first.

First, you multiply 3 * 2 to get 6.

Then you add that result to 5. So, 5 + 6 equals 11.

So after applying the order of operations to simplify 5 + 3 * 2, you get 11.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: First, you have to remember the rule of BIDMAS or PEMDAS:
BIDMAS stands for Brackets, Indices, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).
PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Looking at the problem 7*2+8*5, we don't have brackets or indices (or parentheses or exponents in PEMDAS). So, we skip straight to multiplication and division. 

We have two multiplication operations here: 7*2 and 8*5. 
Multiply 7 and 2 together to get 14.
Multiply 8 and 5 together to get 40.

Then we move to observation and subtraction. There is an addition operation: combining the results of the two multiplications.
So we add 14 and 40 together to get 54. 

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*3+2,"GPT Response: The order of operations, which we can remember using the acronym PEMDAS - Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction - tells us to do multiplication before addition.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, we need to follow the order of operations, which can be remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In the given problem, first thing we see that fits the order of operations is Parentheses: 

4*(2+5)+12-2*3
Let's add the numbers inside the Parentheses first: 2+5 equals 7

So now the problem is:
4*7+12-2*3

Next in the order of operations is Multiplication:

We have two multiplications here, which are 4*7 and 2*3. 

4 times 7 equals 28,
2 times 3 equals 6.

Now, replace those expressions in the equation, so the problem is now:
28+12-6

Lastly, from left to right, we perform Addition and then Subtraction. 

28 plus 12 is 40, 
Then, Subtract 6 from 40 and you get 34.

So the answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+3*2,"GPT Response: The order of operations, which we can remember using the acronym PEMDAS - Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction - tells us to do multiplication before addition. In this problem, we have both multiplication and addition.
