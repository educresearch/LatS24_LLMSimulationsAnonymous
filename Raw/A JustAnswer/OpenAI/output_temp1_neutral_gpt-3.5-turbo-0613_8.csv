systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS. PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this problem, we don't have any parentheses or exponents, so we will move straight to multiplication and division. We see that we have 3 multiplied by 2, which equals 6.

Now we can add 5 to the result of the multiplication. So, 5 + 6 = 11.

Therefore, the final answer is 11."
