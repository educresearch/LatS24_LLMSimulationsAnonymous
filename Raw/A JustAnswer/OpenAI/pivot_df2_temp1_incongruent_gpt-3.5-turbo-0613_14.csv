gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is commonly remembered as PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.

Next, we calculate the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, we can rewrite the expression as: 28 + 12 - 6.

Finally, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40 and 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To simplify this expression according to the order of operations (PEMDAS), we need to perform the multiplication and division before addition and subtraction.

Let's break down the expression step by step:

First, we have 4 multiplied by the sum of 2+5.
4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28.

Next, we have 2 multiplied by 3.
2 * 3 = 6.

So far, we have:
28 + 12 - 6.

Finally, we can perform the remaining addition and subtraction:
28 + 12 = 40.
40 - 6 = 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS. PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Solve the expression inside the parentheses.
Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5 which equals 7.

Step 2: Perform any multiplication or division from left to right.
In the expression, we have two multiplications: 4 * 7 and 2 * 3.
From left to right, we start with 4 * 7, which equals 28.
Then, we move to 2 * 3, which equals 6.

Step 3: Perform any addition or subtraction from left to right.
In the expression, we have two additions: 28 + 12 and 6 - 2.
From left to right, we start with 28 + 12, which equals 40.
Then, we move to 6 - 2, which equals 4.

Therefore, the final answer is 40 + 4, which equals 44.
