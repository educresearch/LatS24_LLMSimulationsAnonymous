The order of operations is usually remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

However, in this problem, we only have multiplication and addition. According to PEMDAS, we should perform the multiplication before the addition.

Here is the problem: 4 * 3 + 2

Step 1: Multiply 4 by 3.
4 * 3 = 12

Step 2: Then, add the result to 2.
12 + 2 = 14

So, following the order of operations, we multiply first and then add, which gives us the final answer.

The answer is 14."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the mathematical problem `4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3`, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, standing for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Here's how I would solve this step by step:

1. **Parentheses**: Solve expressions inside parentheses first.
   `4*(2 + 5)` becomes `4*7` since `2 + 5` equals `7`.

2. Now the expression is `4*7 + 12 - 2*3`.

3. **Multiplication**: Next, we perform the multiplication operations.
   `4*7` equals `28`, and `2*3` equals `6`.

4. Our expression is now `28 + 12 - 6`.

5. **Addition and Subtraction**: Finally, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.
   `28 + 12` equals `40`, and then `40 - 6` equals `34`.

So, putting it all together, the final answer is `34`.

The answer is 34."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this math problem, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations is usually remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for:

- Parentheses
- Exponents (or indices)
- Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
- Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

In this case, there are no parentheses, exponents, or division, so we only need to focus on multiplication and then addition.

First, we do the multiplication part: 3 times 2 equals 6.

5 + 3 * 2
= 5 + (3 * 2)
= 5 + 6

Next, we do the addition: 5 plus 6 equals 11.

So the final answer is 11.

The answer is 11."
