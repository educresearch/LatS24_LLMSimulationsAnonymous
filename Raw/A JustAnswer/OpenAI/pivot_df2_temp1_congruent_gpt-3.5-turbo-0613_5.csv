gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we will follow the order of operations (also known as PEMDAS). 

First, we have to perform the operations within parentheses. 
Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5. Adding these two numbers gives us 7. 
So, the expression becomes 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. 

Next, we will perform the multiplications. 
The first multiplication is 4 * 7, which equals 28. 
The second multiplication is 2 * 3, which equals 6. 

Finally, we will perform the additions and subtractions from left to right. 
The expression becomes 28 + 12 - 6. 
Adding 28 and 12 gives us 40, and subtracting 6 from 40 gives us 34. 

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the Order of Operations (also known as PEMDAS). This means that we perform the calculations in the following order: parentheses, exponents, multiplication/division (from left to right), and addition/subtraction (from left to right).

Let's break down the expression step by step:

1. Start with the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.
   So now the expression becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

2. Next, perform the multiplication: 4 * 7 equals 28, and 2 * 3 equals 6.
   So now the expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 6.

3. Finally, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
   28 + 12 equals 40, and then 40 - 6 equals 34.

Therefore, the final answer is 34.
