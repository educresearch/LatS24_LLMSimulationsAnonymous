gpt-4-0613,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we should first perform the operations in the parentheses according to the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So, the operations in the parentheses are as follows.

2 + 5 = 7

Then we substitute 7 back into the expression. The equation becomes:

4*7 + 12 - 2*3

The next step is to do the multiplication operations:

4*7 = 28
2*3 = 6

So, substituting these values back to the equation, we get:

28 + 12 - 6

Finally, we perform the addition and subtraction operations:

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So, the answer to the math problem 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3 is 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: The problem should be solved using the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

The expression is 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3.

First, solve the expression in the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.â€‹

Now, substitute 7 back into the expression in place of the parentheses:

4*7 + 12 - 2*3.

Next, perform the multiplication operations:

28 + 12 - 6.

Then, perform the addition and subtraction (from left to right):

40 - 6 = 34.

Hence, 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3 = 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: We follow the order of operations using the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we do what's inside the parentheses, so (2 + 5) becomes 7.

Our equation now looks like 4*7 + 12 - 2*3.

Then, we do multiplication and division from left to right. First, we have 4*7 which equals 28. 

And we also have 2*3 equals 6. The equation now should look like this: 28 + 12 - 6.

Then we apply addition and subtraction from left to right. So, we add 28 and 12 together first, which equals 40. The equation now is 40 - 6. 

Then, we subtract 6 from 40, leaving us with 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I will follow the order of operations which can be remembered as PEMDAS or BIDMAS: Parentheses or Brackets, Exponents or Indices, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this problem, first come the parentheses:
4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3
4*7 + 12 - 2*3 <-- (This is because 2 + 5 = 7)

Next, I'll do the multiplication:
28 + 12 - 2*3 <-- (This is because 4*7 = 28)
28 + 12 - 6 <-- (This is because 2*3 = 6)

Then, I'll work from left to right doing the addition and subtraction:
40 - 6 <-- (This is because 28 + 12 = 40)

Finally, I'll subtract:
34 <-- (This is because 40 - 6 = 34)
