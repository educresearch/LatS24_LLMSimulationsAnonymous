   4 * 7 = 28
   
   The problem now becomes: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3

3. Continue with the multiplication: 2 * 3
   2 * 3 = 6
   
   The problem now becomes: 28 + 12 - 6

4. Next, perform the addition: 28 + 12
   28 + 12 = 40

gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS). 

Step 1: Simplify parentheses
Inside the parentheses, we have 2+5 which equals 7. 

So, the expression becomes:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Step 2: Perform multiplication and division from left to right
Multiplying 4 by 7, we get 28.

So, the expression becomes:
28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Multiplying 2 by 3, we get 6.
