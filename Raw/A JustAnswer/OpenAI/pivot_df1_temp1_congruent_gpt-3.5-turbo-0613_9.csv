P stands for parentheses: We first evaluate any operations within parentheses. In this case, there is a set of parentheses containing the addition operation, 2 + 5. Evaluating this gives us 7.

D stands for division: There are no division operations in this expression, so we can move on to multiplication.

M stands for multiplication: We have two multiplications in this expression, 4 * (2 + 5) and 2 * 3. 

First, we evaluate 4 * (2 + 5). Since there are no more parentheses to evaluate, we can multiply 4 by 7 and get 28.
