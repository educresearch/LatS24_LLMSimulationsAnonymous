gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: In mathematics, there is a rule known as the order of operations which is often abbreviated as BIDMAS or PEMDAS:
BIDMAS stands for Brackets, Indices, Division and Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction.
PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction.

According to this rule, multiplication is performed before addition. Therefore in the given expression, multiplication (2*4) should be performed first, followed by addition.

So, here's the step by step solution:
Multiplication:     2 * 4 = 8 
Addition:           5 + 8 = 13  

The answer is 13."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: First, perform the multiplication operations:
7*2 gives 14. 
8*5 gives 40.

Then, add these two results together:
14 + 40 gives 54.

So, 7*2 + 8*5 is 54. 

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: The problem given is 4*3 + 2. 

First, using the order of operations, you should do the multiplication before adding.

4 times 3 would give us 12.

After getting this result, you then add 2 to 12.

12 + 2 gives us 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, perform the operation in the parentheses (also known as brackets), according to the order of operations defined by BIDMAS/BODMAS - Brackets, Indices/Orders, Division and Multiplication (which are of equal priority), Addition and Subtraction (also equal priority).
  
So:
2 + 5 = 7

So the expression becomes:
4*7 + 12 - 2*3

Second, perform the multiplication operations:

4*7 = 28 and 2*3 = 6

So now the expression is simplified to:
28 + 12 - 6

Finally, perform the addition and subtraction operations in the order they appear from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40 and 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: In mathematics, there is a rule called the order of operations, represented by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

Looking at the given problem, there is no parentheses or exponents. There is, however, multiplication and addition:

5 + 3*2

According to PEMDAS, multiplication should be done first before addition. That gives us:

5 + 6

Now that we've resolved the multiplication, we can proceed to the addition:

11

Consequently, the answer is 11."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: First, it is important to note that when performing arithmetic operations, one must follow the 'order of operations'. This is abbreviated by the mnemonic ""PEMDAS"", which stands for Parenthesis, Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.), Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).
   
Therefore, in the given problem, we must perform the multiplication before the addition. 
   
2*4 equals 8. 
   
Afterwards, we add 5 to the result of the multiplication:
   
5 + 8 equals 13. 

Therefore, the answer is 13."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: First, we will use the mathematical principle of the order of operations, also known as BIDMAS or PEMDAS, which states that multiplication and division should be performed before addition and subtraction. Thus, we'll first perform the multiplication operations:

7*2 = 14 and 8*5 = 40

Then, we will proceed with the addition:

14 + 40 = 54.

So, 7*2 + 8*5 equals 54.

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, multiply 4 and 3 together, which equals to 12. Then, add 2 to 12, resulting in 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, use the order of operations rule, often abbreviated as PEDMAS or BODMAS, which states that you should perform Parentheses/Brackets, Orders (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.), Division and Multiplication (left-to-right), Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right).

Here is how you solve:

1. Solve the brackets (2 + 5) to get 7. The simplified equation now looks: 
   
    4*7 + 12 - 2*3
   

2. Then do the multiplication: 

    - Multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. This changes the equation to 
    28 + 12 - 2*3

    - Then multiply 2 by 3 to get 6. This changes the equation to 
    28 + 12 - 6

   
3. Subsequently, add 28 and 12 to get 40. This changes the equation to 

    40 - 6.

4. Lastly, subtract 6 from 40 to get 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: This problem is based on the BIDMAS/BODMAS rule. BIDMAS stands for Brackets, Indices, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). BODMAS stands for Brackets, Orders (square roots, etc.), Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So, according to these rules, we have to perform multiplication before addition. 

The multiplication is 3*2, which equals 6.

Then, we add this result to 5, which is 5+6, and that equals 11.

The answer is 11."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: In mathematics, we follow a rule for the order of operations known as BIDMAS or PEMDAS - Brackets, Indices (or Exponents in PEMDAS), Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So, the first operation you perform in the given problem 5 + 2*4 is Multiplication. 

This gives: 
5 + 2*4
= 5 + 8
     = 13

The operation of addition secound because it comes after Multiplication in the BIDMAS or PEMDAS rule.

So the final answer is 

The answer is 13."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: The order of operations tells us to perform multiplication and division operations before addition and subtraction. In this case, we have two multiplication operations that we should perform first. The order of these operations does not matter because multiplication is commutative, meaning the order doesn't affect the result. 

So, first, we perform 7*2 (which equals 14), and then 8*5 (which equals 40).

Next, we add these two results together: 14 from the first multiplication operation and 40 from the second.

So, 14 + 40 = 54.

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: In mathematics, we follow the order of operations, also known as BIDMAS or PEMDAS. This acronym stands for Brackets, Indices (or Exponents), Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

The given problem is 4*3 + 2. According to BIDMAS or PEMDAS, multiplication comes before addition. So we first multiply 4 and 3.

4 * 3 = 12

Then we add the result to 2.

12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Looking at the problem 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,

Start with the Parentheses (2 + 5) -> 7
So, the problem becomes 4*7 + 12 - 2*3,

Next, follow Multiplication:
  - 4*7 -> 28
  - 2*3 -> 6
So, the problem becomes 28 + 12 - 6,

Finally, follow Addition and Subtraction from left to right:
  - 28 + 12 -> 40
  - 40 - 6 -> 34

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: In mathematics, we follow a rule called the ""Order of Operations"". This rule guides us on how to solve math problems with more than one operation like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The rule is often remembered using the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

Looking at the problem, here we do not have Parentheses or Exponents, so we move to Multiplication and Division. 
First, we perform the multiplication: 
3*2 = 6 
Then, we replace the result back into the equation: 
5 + 6

Finally, we perform the addition: 
5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, using the order of operations, you should always do multiplication and division before you do addition and subtraction. In this case, the problem involves a multiplication and an addition. So, we perform the multiplication first.

The problem becomes:

4*3 = 12

Addition and subtraction (from left to right). 

In the expression, 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3, start off by doing the operation in the brackets (2 + 5), which equals 7.

Now, the equation becomes 4*7 + 12 - 2*3.

Next step, perform the multiplication operations. So, 4*7 equals 28. And, 2*3 equals 6.
