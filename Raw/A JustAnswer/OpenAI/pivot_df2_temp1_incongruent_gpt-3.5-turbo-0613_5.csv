gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations (also known as PEMDAS). 

1. First, we perform the operations inside the parentheses: 
   2+5 = 7

2. Next, we perform the multiplications and divisions from left to right: 
   4 * 7 = 28
   2 * 3 = 6

3. Then, we perform the additions and subtractions from left to right: 
   28 + 12 = 40
   40 - 6 = 34

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations: parentheses, multiplication/division (from left to right), and addition/subtraction (from left to right).

First, let's simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

Now, let's simplify the multiplication and subtraction:
4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Next, let's simplify the addition:
28 + 12 = 40

Finally, let's subtract:
40 - 6 = 34

Therefore, the final answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS. 

P stands for Parentheses: First, we need to solve any operations inside parentheses. In this problem, there is an expression inside parentheses: (2+5).

2 + 5 = 7

So, the expression simplifies to: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next is E for Exponents: There are no exponents in this problem.

Next is MD for Multiplication and Division: We need to perform any multiplication or division from left to right. 

4 * 7 = 28

Now the expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3

2 * 3 = 6 

Now the expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 6

Finally, A and S for Addition and Subtraction: We need to perform addition and subtraction from left to right.

28 + 12 = 40

Now the expression becomes: 40 - 6

40 - 6 = 34

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us the order in which we should perform operations in a mathematical expression.

The first operation we need to perform is inside the parentheses. In this case, we have the expression 2 + 5. Adding these two numbers together, we get 7.

Now we can rewrite the expression as 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, we need to perform the multiplication. We have two multiplication operations in the expression: 4 * 7 and 2 * 3. Multiplying 4 by 7 gives us 28, and multiplying 2 by 3 gives us 6.

Now we can rewrite the expression as 28 + 12 - 6.

The next operation is addition. We have two addition operations: 28 + 12 and 12 - 6. Adding 28 and 12 gives us 40, and subtracting 6 from 12 gives us 6.

Now we can rewrite the expression as 40 - 6.

Finally, we perform the subtraction operation. Subtracting 6 from 40 gives us 34.

The final answer is 34."
