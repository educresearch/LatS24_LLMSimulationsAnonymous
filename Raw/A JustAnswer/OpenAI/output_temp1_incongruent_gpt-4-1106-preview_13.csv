The order of operations is a set of rules to let you know which calculations to perform first when you're working on a math problem. The acronym PEMDAS can help you remember the order:

- Parentheses
- Exponents (or powers and roots, like squared or square root)
- Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
- Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Looking at the problem 4 * 3 + 2, there are no parentheses, exponents, or division, but we do have multiplication and addition. According to the order of operations, we should do the multiplication before we do the addition.

So, let's start with the multiplication:
4 * 3 = 12

Now, we take that result and do the addition:
12 + 2 = 14

So the final answer is:
The answer is 14."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this math problem, you must follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:

- Parentheses
- Exponents
- Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
- Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Parentheses**: First, we solve the expression inside the parentheses (2+5):

   \( 4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3 \)
   
   becomes
   
   \( 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3 \)

2. Now that we have resolved the parentheses, we move on to **Multiplication** and **Division**:

   Multiply:

   \( 4 * 7 \) is \( 28 \),
   and then
   \( 2 * 3 \) is \( 6 \),
   
   so our expression becomes:
   
   \( 28 + 12 - 6 \)

3. Finally, we solve **Addition** and **Subtraction** from left to right:

   Add:

   \( 28 + 12 \) is \( 40 \),
   
   and then subtract:
   
   \( 40 - 6 \) is \( 34 \).

So, after performing the operations in the correct order, we find that the final answer to the problem is \( 34 \). 

The answer is 34."

The order of operations can be remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:

- Parentheses first
- Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
- Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
- Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

In the expression you've given, which is:

5 + 3 * 2

There are no parentheses or exponents, so we move on to the next step, which is multiplication and division. We look at the expression from left to right and we do any multiplication or division as we find it before doing any addition or subtraction.

So we first perform the multiplication:

3 * 2 = 6

Now the expression looks like this:

5 + 6

Finally, we perform the addition:

5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11."
