gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we will follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS. 

First, we need to simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

Next, we multiply the result by 4:
4 * 7 = 28

Moving on, we have:
12 - 2 * 3

Next, we multiply:
2 * 3 = 6

Finally, we subtract 6 from 12:
12 - 6 = 6

To find the final answer, we add the result of the first expression (28) and the second expression (6):
28 + 6 = 34

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations known as PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we calculate anything inside parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

Now we can simplify the expression:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we perform the multiplication and division operations from left to right:
4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Our simplified expression becomes:
28 + 12 - 6

Finally, we perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right:
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the order of operations, we need to follow the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Let's go step by step:

Step 1: Solve inside the parentheses.
Inside the parentheses, we have the expression 2+5, which equals 7.

Step 2: Perform multiplication and division from left to right.
We have multiplication between 4 and (2+5). Since we already solved the expression inside the parentheses, we can multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28.
We also have multiplication between 2 and 3, which equals 6.

Step 3: Perform addition and subtraction from left to right.
Now, we have 28 + 12 - 6. We can add 28 and 12 first, which equals 40.
So, we have 40 - 6, which equals 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS. 

PEMDAS stands for:
- Parentheses first
- Exponents (i.e., powers and square roots, etc.)
- Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
- Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Now let's solve the problem:

First, we have parentheses: (2 + 5), which equals 7.

Next, we multiply 4 with the result of the parentheses: 4 * 7 = 28.

Then, we have subtraction: 12 - 2 = 10.

Finally, we have multiplication: 2 * 3 = 6.

To get the final answer, we subtract 6 from 10: 10 - 6 = 4.

Therefore, the answer is 4."
