Parentheses first: We will calculate the expression within the parentheses (2+5):\n   4 * (2+5) becomes 4 * 7\n\nNow our expression looks like this:\n\n4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3\n\n2. Multiplication: We will perform the multiplication operations next:\n\n   - First multiplication:\n     4 * 7 = 28\n\n   - Second multiplication:\n     2 * 3 = 6\n\nNow the expression is:\n\n28 + 12 - 6\n\n3. Addition and Subtraction: Now we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n\n   - First, we do the addition:\n     28 + 12 = 40\n\n   - Then we subtract:\n     40 - 6 = 34\n\nSo the final answer to the expression is 34.\n\nThe answer is 34."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400", "model": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 400, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in grade 6 learning order of operations for the first time.\n                    Explain your solution to this given Mathematics problem, and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "5+3 * 2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: When we solve math problems that involve multiple operations like addition and multiplication, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations tells us which calculations to perform first to get the right answer. The order is usually remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for:\n\nP - Parentheses first\nE - Exponents (i.e., powers and square roots, etc.)\nMD - Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)\nAS - Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)\n\nEven without parentheses or exponents in this problem, we still need to pay attention to the order in which we perform multiplication and addition.\n\nSo for the problem 5 + 3 * 2, we first do the multiplication before the addition:\n\nFirst, we multiply 3 * 2 which is 6.\n\nThen we take that result and add it to 5.\n\nSo the equation looks like this after we perform the multiplication:\n5 + (3 * 2)\n= 5 + 6\n= 11\n\nThe answer is 11."}]}]
