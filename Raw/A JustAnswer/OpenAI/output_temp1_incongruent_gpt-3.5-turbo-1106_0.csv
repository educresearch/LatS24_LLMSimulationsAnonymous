systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-1106_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the rules of the order of operations. The order of operations is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).

Given the expression 5 + 3 * 2, we first perform the multiplication since it comes before addition in the order of operations.

3 * 2 = 6

Now we add 5 to the product we got:

5 + 6 = 11

So, the answer is 
""The answer is 11."""
