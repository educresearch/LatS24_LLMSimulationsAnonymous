systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to use the order of operations. The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us the correct order in which to perform mathematical operations.

The order of operations is as follows:

1. Parentheses: Perform any calculations inside parentheses first.
2. Exponents: Perform any calculations involving exponents (powers) next.
3. Multiplication and Division: Perform any multiplication or division from left to right.
4. Addition and Subtraction: Perform any addition or subtraction from left to right.

Now let's apply the order of operations to the given problem:

First, we see that there are parentheses in the expression (2 + 5). Inside the parentheses, we have a simple addition operation, and the answer is 7.

Next, we have 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. According to the order of operations, we need to perform multiplication before addition or subtraction. So, let's calculate 4 * 7, which equals 28.

Now we have 28 + 12 - 2 * 3. Multiplying 2 by 3 gives us 6.

The expression becomes 28 + 12 - 6. Since addition and subtraction have the same level of priority, we perform them from left to right.

28 + 12 equals 40. 

Finally, 40 - 6 equals 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34."

P stands for parentheses, but there are no parentheses in this problem. 

E stands for exponents, but there are no exponents in this problem. 

MD stands for multiplication and division, and AS stands for addition and subtraction. 

So, we start from left to right and perform any multiplication or division operations before addition or subtraction. 

In this case, we have 3 multiplied by 2. So, we need to do that first. 

3 multiplied by 2 equals 6. 

Now, we have 5 plus 6. We can add these two numbers. 

5 plus 6 equals 11. 

Therefore, the final answer to the problem ""5 + 3 times 2"" is 11. 

The answer is 11."
