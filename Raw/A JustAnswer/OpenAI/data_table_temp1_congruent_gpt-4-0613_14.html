      <td>GPT Response: The problem should be solved by following the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>The given problem is: 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3<br><br>1. First, solve the addition inside the parentheses (2 + 5 = 7).<br>The problem now reads: 4*7 + 12 - 2*3<br><br>2. Next, perform the multiplication operations. Multiply 4 and 7 to get 28 and multiply 2 and 3 to get 6.<br>The problem now reads: 28 + 12 - 6<br><br>3. Finally, perform the remaining operations from left to right. Add 28 and 12 to get 40 and then subtract 6 from 40 to get 34.<br><br>So, the answer to the problem is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: The first step in solving this problem is to do the operations inside parentheses because in the order of operations rule, parentheses come first. In this case, we have (2 + 5) which equals 7.<br><br>So the equation becomes: <br><br>4*7 + 12 - 2*3<br><br>The next step is to do the multiplication operation. This is because, after parentheses, the next operations you should do in the order of operations are multiplication and division, going from left to right. So we have 4 * 7 which gives 28, and then 2 * 3 which gives 6.<br><br>The equation now looks like this: <br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Then, the last step is to do the addition and subtraction operations. Going from left to right, we have 28 + 12 which equals 40, and then 40 - 6 which equals 34.<br><br>So the final answer is 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, you should solve the operation inside the parentheses. That is (2 + 5) which equals 7. <br><br>After solving the operation inside the parentheses, you replace the value of (2 + 5) by 7 in the expression. <br><br>So, the expression becomes 4*7 + 12 - 2*3.<br><br>Next, you have to perform multiplication operations according to the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEDMAS). There are two multiplication operations: 4*7 which equals 28 and 2*3 which equals 6.<br><br>Then, you replace those multiplication operations with their results: the expression becomes 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Finally, you perform the addition and subtraction from left to right: first 28 + 12 equals 40, then, 40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>So, the final answer to the given Mathematics problem is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
