gpt-4-0613,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: The order of operations in mathematics is commonly remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

Following these order, first perform the operations in the parentheses: 
2+5=7

Then substitute this back into the equation, so it becomes:
4*7+12-2*3

Next, perform the multiplication:
4*7=28
2*3=6

After substituting these results back into the equation, it becomes:
28+12-6

Lastly, perform the addition and subtraction, from left to right: 
28+12=40
40-6=34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem we must follow the order of operations, best remembered as PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

First, deal with what's in parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.

Then proceed with the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28.

After that, see that 2 * 3 = 6.

The equation should now look like this: 28 + 12 - 6.

Finally, get the result by doing the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: In order to solve this problem, we must follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS or BODMAS.

Here is the problem broken down:

1. 4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3

Start with the operation inside the parentheses: 

2. 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3 

Next, perform the multiplication operations:

3. 28 + 12 - 6 

Finally, perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right:

4. 40 - 6 

5. 34

So, the solution to the problem 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3, following the order of operations, is 34. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, you should always start with the operations in the brackets (parentheses) because of the BIDMAS/BODMAS rule which stands for Brackets, Indices, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). So here, the expression in the brackets is 2 + 5, which adds up to 7. The equation then becomes:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, you should do the multiplication (another part of BIDMAS/BODMAS rule). So, you multiply 4 with 7 to get 28, and 2 with 3 to get 6. This results in:

28 + 12 - 6

Finally, you should do the addition and then subtraction. So, 28 + 12 gives you 40 and then you subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34. 

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: This math problem applies the order of operations, also known as BIDMAS or PEMDAS. BIDMAS stands for Brackets, Indices, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.), Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So, it means that multiplication operations are performed before addition.

First, multiply 4 and 3 to get 12.
Then, add the result, 12, to 2. The result is 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: In this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, commonly known by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

There are no parentheses or exponents in this problem, so we start with multiplication and division from left to right. We have 4 * 3 which is 12.

Next, we have addition and subtraction from left to right. The only operation left is addition, so we add the 2 to the 12 obtained from the multiplication, giving us 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: In Mathematics, when we solve equations or problems we follow a rule that is often remembered as ""PEMDAS"" or ""BODMAS"". 

Both the ""PEMDAS"" and ""BODMAS"" acronyms stand for:
P/B: Parentheses/Brackets (remove parentheses, solve expression in the parentheses/brackets first)
E/O: Exponents/Orders (squared numbers, square roots, etc.)
MD: Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS: Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

According to the rule, we should do multiplication or division before we do addition or subtraction. The problem you have here is ""4 * 3 + 2"". This problem has only multiplication and an addition to perform.

We apply the rule and first do the multiplication. 4 * 3 equals 12. The problem now translates to 

    12 + 2.

Finally, do the addition. 12 + 2 equals 14.

So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we must follow the Order of Operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

According to these rules, the multiplication operation should be carried out first before the addition.

So for the expression 5 + 2 * 4.

First, do the multiplication i.e 2 * 4 = 8.

Then, add the result to 5 i.e 5 + 8 = 13.

So, 5 + 2 * 4 = 13.
