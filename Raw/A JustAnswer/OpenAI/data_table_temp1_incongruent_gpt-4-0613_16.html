      <td>GPT Response: The first step is to perform the operations in the parenthesis, following the BODMAS/BIDMAS/PEMDAS rule. The BODMAS/BIDMAS/PEMDAS rule (Bracket, Order/Indices, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction) identifies the order of operations in solving mathematical equations.<br><br>In the equation 4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3, start with the parenthesis:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, handle the multiplication operations:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Then the subtraction and addition operation respectively.<br><br>40 - 6<br><br>This results in 34.<br><br>So, 4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3 equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: For any math problems, the order of operations should be followed. The order is usually denoted by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)). <br><br>First, perform operations inside the parenthesis. It has 2 + 5 which equals 7.<br><br>Next, perform the multiplication operation. Replace (2 + 5) by 7, giving us 4 * 7 on the left side of the equation which equals 28.<br><br>Then, consider further the multiplication identified in the equation 2*3 = 6.<br><br>Now, the equation becomes 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>According to PEMDAS rule, perform addition first. 28+ 12 =40.<br><br>Subtract the result from the remaining multiplication. Therefore, we have 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we have to follow the order of operations known as BIDMAS or PEMDAS (Bracket/Parentheses, Indices/Exponents, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).<br><br>First, solve whatever is in the brackets. Here, we have (2 + 5). Calculate this and get 7.<br><br>So, the equation should look like this:<br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Then do the multiplication. Here, we have two multiplications: 4 * 7 and 2 * 3. These are 28 and 6 respectively.<br><br>Substitute these results back into the equation:<br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Lastly, do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So, add 28 to 12 which gives 40 and then subtract 6.<br><br>40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we have to solve the operation in the parentheses, because the P in PEMDAS/BODMAS stands for Parentheses/Brackets which means we solve those first. Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5 which equals 7.<br><br>Next, remember the order of operations, we follow the rule of PEMDAS/BODMAS:<br>P – Parentheses first<br>E – Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)  <br>MD – Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)<br>AS – Addition and subtraction (left-to-right)<br><br>We've already done P, but there are no operations in E to perform, so we move on to MD. <br><br>So the initial equation 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3, after performing 2+5, becomes 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. <br><br>Now, we perform Multiplication operation: 4 multiplication by 7 equals 28 and 2 multiplication by 3 equals 6. So we substitute those values back into the equation and we now have 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Finally, we just do the addition and subtraction from left to right; first we add 28 and 12 to get 40. Subtracting 6 from 40 gives us 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
