systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this math problem, you need to follow the order of operations which is commonly known by the acronym PEMDAS:
- P for Parentheses: solve any expressions inside parentheses first.
- E for Exponents: solve exponents (powers and roots, etc.) if there are any.
- MD for Multiplication and Division: solve multiplication and division next, from left to right.
- AS for Addition and Subtraction: solve addition and subtraction last, from left to right.

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Solve inside the parentheses first: 
   (2 + 5) equals 7.

2. Multiply: 
   4 times 7 equals 28.

The problem now looks like this:
28 + 12 - 2*3

3. Next, do the multiplication before addition and subtraction:
   2 times 3 equals 6.

So now we have:
28 + 12 - 6

4. Finally, we do addition and subtraction from left to right:
   28 + 12 equals 40,
   then subtract 6 from 40 which equals 34.

So, the answer is 34."

In mathematics, the order of operations is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

For the problem 5 + 3*2, there are no parentheses or exponents to deal with, so we start with multiplication.

First, calculate the multiplication part:
3 * 2 = 6

After that, you do the addition:
5 + 6 = 11

Therefore, the final answer is 11.

The answer is 11."
