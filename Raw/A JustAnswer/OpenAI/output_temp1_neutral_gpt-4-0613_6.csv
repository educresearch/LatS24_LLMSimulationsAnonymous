4*(2+5) + 12 - 2*3 = 34

The answer is 34."

The order of operations, also known as BIDMAS, stands for Brackets, Indices, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

The problem we have is 5 + 3 * 2. According to order of operations, multiplication comes before addition. 

So, we should first perform the multiplication:

3 * 2 = 6

Then, we add that result to 5: 

5 + 6 = 11

So, the final answer is 11."
