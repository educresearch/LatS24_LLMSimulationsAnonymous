systemPrompt4_userPrompt3_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: The order of operations is a set of rules that tells you the correct sequence in which to solve different parts of a math problem. In the order of operations, you perform calculations in the following order:

1. Parentheses (simplify inside them first)
2. Exponents (also known as powers or indices)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

The problem we have is 4*3 + 2. Since there are no parentheses or exponents to deal with here, we'll start with the multiplication and then the addition.

First, we multiply 4 by 3:

4 * 3 = 12

Next, we add 2 to the result of that multiplication:

12 + 2 = 14

So, after performing the operations in the correct order, we find that the answer is 14. 

The answer is 14."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this math problem, we'll use the order of operations, which can be remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: 

P: Parentheses first
E: Exponents (i.e. powers and square roots, etc.)
MD: Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS: Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

Following this order:

1. Parentheses: Calculate the expression inside the parentheses first.
   4*(2 + 5)
   Inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7

2. After the parentheses are simplified, we have:
   4*7 + 12 - 2*3

3. Next, we do the multiplication before addition and subtraction:
   4*7 = 28
   2*3 = 6

4. Now the expression looks like:
   28 + 12 - 6

5. Finally, we do addition and subtraction from left to right:
   28 + 12 = 40
   40 - 6 = 34

Therefore, after following the order of operations, we find that the expression simplifies to 34.

The answer is 34."

The acronym PEMDAS is often used to remember the order: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

For the expression 5 + 3*2, there are no parentheses or exponents, but there is multiplication and addition. According to the order of operations, you have to do the multiplication before the addition.

So first, you multiply 3 by 2:

3 * 2 = 6

Then you add that result to 5:

5 + 6 = 11

So the final answer is 11. 

The answer is 11."
