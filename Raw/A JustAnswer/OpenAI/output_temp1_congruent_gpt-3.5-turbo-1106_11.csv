systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-1106_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).

In this problem, the operation we need to do first is multiplication. We need to multiply 3 and 2 together.

So, 3 * 2 = 6.

Now we can add 5 to the result of the multiplication.

5 + 6 = 11.

So, the answer is 11."
