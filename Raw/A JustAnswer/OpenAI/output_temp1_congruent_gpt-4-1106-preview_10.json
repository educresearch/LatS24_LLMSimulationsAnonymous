Addition and Subtraction:\n   Finally, we'll perform the addition and subtraction, from left to right.\n\n   Add 28 and 12:\n   40 - 6\n\n   Then subtract 6 from 40:\n   40 - 6 = 34\n\nThe answer is 34."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400", "model": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 400, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in grade 6 learning order of operations for the first time.\n                    Explain your solution to this given Mathematics problem, and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "5 + 3*2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: In mathematics, we often use the order of operations, which is a set of rules that tells us the order in which we should solve parts of a mathematical expression to get the correct answer. The most common order of operations is remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:\n\n- P: Parentheses first\n- E: Exponents (i.e. powers and square roots, etc.)\n- MD: Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)\n- AS: Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)\n\nIn the expression you've given (5 + 3 * 2), there are no parentheses, exponents, division, or subtraction, just addition and multiplication.\n\nAccording to PEMDAS, we need to do the multiplication before we do the addition. So we first multiply 3 by 2:\n\n3 * 2 = 6\n\nNow that we've done the multiplication, we can do the addition by adding this result to 5:\n\n5 + 6 = 11\n\nSo the final answer to the expression 5 + 3*2 is 11.\n\nThe answer is 11."}]}]
