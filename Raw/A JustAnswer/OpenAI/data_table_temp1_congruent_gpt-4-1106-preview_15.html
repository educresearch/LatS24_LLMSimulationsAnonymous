      <td>GPT Response: To solve this math problem, you need to follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS or BIDMAS, which stands for Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Indices, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>Here's how you would solve the problem step by step:<br><br>1. Parentheses (or Brackets) first: Calculate the expression inside the parentheses (2 + 5).<br>2. Exponents (or Indices): This problem doesn't have any, so we can skip this step.<br>3. Multiplication and Division: Next, carry out the multiplication and division in the order they appear from left to right.<br>4. Addition and Subtraction: Finally, do the addition and subtraction from left to right.<br><br>Let's go through the steps with the given expression: 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3<br><br>1. Parentheses: Calculate what's inside the parentheses first.<br>   4*(2 + 5) becomes 4*7 because 2 + 5 is 7.<br>   <br>2. There are no exponents to work with in this expression, so we'll move on.<br><br>3. Multiplication: Now, do the multiplication. There are two multiplication operations:<br>   - First, do 4*7, which equals 28.<br>   - Then, do 2*3, which equals 6.<br>   So now the expression looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6<br><br>4. Addition and Subtraction: Now you simply add and subtract from left to right.<br>   - First, add 28 and 12, which equals 40.<br>   - Then, subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34.<br>   <br>Therefore, the final answer is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
