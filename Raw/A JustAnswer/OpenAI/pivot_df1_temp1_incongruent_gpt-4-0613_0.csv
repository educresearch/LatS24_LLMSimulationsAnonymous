gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: In mathematical operations, there is an order defined by BIDMAS or BODMAS rule. The order is:

1. Brackets response: Any operation enclosed in a bracket is performed first.
2. Orders response: Operations involving indices (powers and square roots) are done next.
3. Division and multiplication response: After step 2, perform any multiplication and division in order from left to right.
4. Addition and subtraction: Finally, after step 3, perform any adding and subtracting in order from left to right.

According to that, multiplication must be done before addition.
So, in your question, we have to do the multiplication first: 2*4 = 8.

Then we add 5: 5 + 8 = 13. 

The answer is 13."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: First, you should apply the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Given problem: 7 * 2 + 8 * 5

There are no parentheses or exponents.

Next, you perform the multiplication operations: 
7 * 2 = 14 
8 * 5 = 40 

The expression now looks like this: 14 + 40

Finally, you perform the addition operation: 
14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: This mathematical operation should be solved by following the order of operations, known as BIDMAS or PEMDAS:

Parentheses
Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
Multiplication and Division
Addition and Subtraction

Mitchell work from left to right. So, you should solve multiplication before you do addition. In this case, it would be:

First, solve 4 * 3 = 12
Then, take that result and add 2 

So, 12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, we perform the operations inside the parentheses, because according to the order of operations, or PEMDAS/BODMAS, parentheses/brackets come first. So, 2 + 5 = 7.

Then, we multiply 4 by 7 (since multiplication comes before addition or subtraction in PEMDAS). This gives 4 * 7 = 28.

Then, add 12 to the result, which leads to 28 + 12 = 40.

Finally, subtract 2 * 3 (again, because multiplication comes before addition or subtraction), which is 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: In mathematical operations, there is an order defined by BIDMAS or BODMAS rule where;

B: Brackets first
O: Orders (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
DM: Division and Multiplication (left-to-right)
AS: Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

According to this rule, multiplication should be performed before addition. Hence, in this problem, you should multiply 3 by 2 firstly, then add the result to 5. 

3 * 2 equals to 6. 

Then, if you add 5 to this result, 5 + 6 equals to 11. 

So, the final answer is 11."

First, perform the operation inside the parentheses according to the order of operations, often known by the acronym PEMDAS/BODMAS which stands for Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication & Division (from left to right), Addition & Subtraction (from left to right).

Inside the parentheses, add 2 and 5 to get 7.

The equation now reads: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, perform the multiplication operations. Multiply 4 by 7 to get 28 and multiply 2 by 3 to get 6.

Then the equation becomes: 28 + 12 - 6.

Then, add 28 and 12 to get 40.

- Parentheses
- Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
- Multiplication and Division
- Addition and Subtraction

The problem is 4 * 3 + 2. According to PEMDAS, we start with multiplication before addition. So, we multiply 4 and 3 first, then add 2:

Step 1: Multiply 4 and 3. This gives us 12.
Step 2: Add the result from step 1 to 2. So, 12 + 2 equals 14.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Okay, let's solve this step by step with respect to the order of operations, which is often remembered by the abbreviation BIDMAS or PEMDAS:

- BIDMAS: Brackets, Indices or Powers, Division and Multiplication (left-to-right), Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right).
- PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Using these rules, we prioritize brackets or parentheses first.

The expression is: 
4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3

Step 1: Resolve the brackets (2 + 5 = 7), giving us:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Step 2: Then, we do the multiplication next:
4*7 = 28 and 2*3 = 6, so the expression becomes:
28 + 12 - 6

Step 3: From left to right, we do the addition and subtraction. 
First, add 28 and 12 (which gives us 40), so the expression becomes:
40 - 6

Lastly, subtract 6 from 40, giving us final answer:

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: In Mathematics, we use the order of operations to solve problems that have more than one operation, like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The order of operations rule that we follow is ""PEMDAS"" or ""BIDMAS"". P stands for Parentheses first, E stands for Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.), MD stands for Multiplication and Division (left-to-right), AS stands for Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right).

This rule ensures that we always perform calculations in the right order.

So, looking at the problem: 
4 * 3 + 2

According to BIDMAS, firstly we have to carry out the multiplication operation before adding.

Multiplying 4 and 3 gives 12, that means

12 + 2

And now, we carry out the addition operation.

Adding 12 and 2 gives 14.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we have to follow the BIDMAS or PEDMAS order of operations. This stands for Brackets/parentheses, Indices/Exponents, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

First, we solve anything inside parentheses or brackets. 
We have (2+5) in brackets, adding these two numbers we get 7.

The equation will now look like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we move on to multiplication and division (from left to right). The first operation is multiplication of 4 and 7. This gives us 28.

The equation is now: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Moving left to right, the next operation is again multiplication - 2 * 3, that gives us 6.

The equation is now: 28 + 12 - 6

Finally, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right. 

First, we add 28 and 12 which gives us 40. 

The equation is now: 40 - 6

Finally, we subtract 6 from 40 to get 34. 

The answer is 34."
