gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this expression, we follow the rules of operations, also known as BEDMAS (brackets, exponents, division and multiplication, and addition and subtraction) to ensure the correct order of operations is followed.

First, we start by simplifying the expression inside the parentheses: (2+5) = 7.

Now the expression becomes:

4*(7) + 12 - 2*3.

Next, we perform the multiplications: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6.

The expression now becomes:

28 + 12 - 6.

Finally, we perform the additions and subtractions from left to right: 

28 + 12 = 40.

40 - 6 = 34.

Therefore, the final answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this expression, we follow the order of operations (also known as PEMDAS).

First, we need to find the value of the expression inside the parentheses, which is (2+5).
2+5 equals 7.

Next, we can simplify the expression by multiplying 4 by 7, since multiplication takes precedence over addition or subtraction.
4 * 7 equals 28.

Now, we have the expression 28 + 12 - 2 * 3 left.
Multiplication and division also take precedence over addition or subtraction, so we need to multiply 2 by 3 before continuing.
2 * 3 equals 6.

Now we have the expression 28 + 12 - 6 left.
Finally, we can add or subtract from left to right.
28 + 12 equals 40.
40 - 6 equals 34.

Therefore, the final answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we see that there are no parentheses or exponents, so we move on to multiplication and division.

We have two multiplication operations: 4*(2+5) and 2*3. Since there is no division in this problem, we can do the multiplications in any order we choose.

Let's start with 4*(2+5). 

Inside the parenthesis, we have 2+5, which equals 7. 

So, 4*(2+5) simplifies to 4*7, which is equal to 28.

The problem now becomes:

28+12-2*3.

Next, we perform the second multiplication operation, which is 2*3. This equals 6.

So, the problem becomes:

28+12-6.

Finally, we can perform the addition and subtraction operations.

28+12 equals 40.

Then, 40-6 equals 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS. PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Let's work through the problem step by step:

First, we encounter the expression inside the parentheses: (2+5). Using addition, we find that 2+5 equals 7. So, we can rewrite the expression as: 4*(7)+12-2*3.

Next, we move on to the multiplication operations. We have 4*(7) and 2*3. Multiplying 4 by 7 gives us 28, and multiplying 2 by 3 gives us 6. So, the expression becomes: 28+12-6.

After multiplication, we move on to addition and subtraction. We add 28 and 12, which gives us 40. Then, we subtract 6 from 40, which gives us 34.

Therefore, the answer to the given expression is 34.

The answer is 34."
