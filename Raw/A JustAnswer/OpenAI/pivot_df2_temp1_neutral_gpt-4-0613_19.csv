gpt-4-0613,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, perform the operation inside the parentheses:
2+5 = 7

Then multiply by 4:
4*7 = 28

Subtract 2*3 which is 6 from 12:
12 - 6 = 6

Finally, add the two results together:
28 + 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: The order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, dictates that operations should be done in the following order: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication & Division (from left to right), Addition & Subtraction (from left to right), 

Applying these rules to the problem:

4*(2+5)+12-2*3

First, perform the operation in the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7

So, the expression becomes:

4*7+12-2*3

Next, multiplication: 4*7 = 28 and 2*3 = 6

So, the expression becomes:

28+12-6

To finish, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40, and 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: The first step to solve this problem is to perform the operation inside the brackets (parentheses). According to the BIDMAS/BODMAS rule (Brackets, Indices/Orders, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction), operations enclosed in parentheses are done first.  
  
So, let's add 2 and 5: 
   4*(2+5) + 12 - 2*3
 = 4*7 + 12 - 2*3

The next step is to do the multiplication. So, we perform the two separate multiplication operations:
  = 28 + 12 - 6 

Now, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
  = 40 - 6
  = 34

So, the solution to the problem is 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: In solving this problem, I will use the order of operations, which in mathematics is often remembered through the acronym PEMDAS: Parenthesis, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In the given math problem,  
  
==> 4*(2+5)+12-2*3

The first thing I do, looking at PEMDAS, is to solve what's in the parenthesis (2+5). We get:

==> 4*7+12-2*3

Next, looking at PEMDAS, we perform the multiplication operations. There are two multiplication operations in the problem: 4*7 and 2*3. 

When we do these, we get:

==> 28+12-6

Finally, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right, we first add 28 and 12 to get 40; then from 40, we subtract 6:

==> 40-6 

This simplifies to 34.

Therefore,

The answer is 34."
