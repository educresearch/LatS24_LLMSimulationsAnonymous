PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nIn the given expression, we have the following operations:\n- Parentheses: (2 + 5)\n- Multiplication: 4 * (2 + 5) and 2*3\n- Addition: the sum of 4 * (2 + 5) and 12\n- Subtraction: the difference between the previous result and 2 * 3\n\nLet's start solving step by step using the order of operations.\n\nFirst, we solve the parentheses (2 + 5) which is equal to 7.\n\nNext, we solve the multiplication 4 * 7, which is equal to 28.\n\nNext, we solve the multiplication 2 * 3, which is equal to 6.\n\nNow, we add the result of 4 * 7 (which is 28) to 12, giving us 40.\n\nFinally, we subtract 40 by the result of 2 * 3 (which is 6), giving us the final answer.\n\nThe answer is 34."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 400, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in grade 6 learning order of operations for the first time.\n                    Explain your solution to this given Mathematics problem, and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "5 + 3*2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us in what order to perform different mathematical operations.\n\nThe order of operations is as follows:\n1. Parentheses: Any operations inside parentheses must be done first.\n2. Exponents: Any exponentiation must be done next.\n3. Multiplication and Division: Multiplication and division should be performed from left to right.\n4. Addition and Subtraction: Addition and subtraction should be performed from left to right.\n\nIn this problem, we have only one operation, which is multiplication, and it's surrounded by addition.\n\nSo, first, we need to perform the multiplication. 3 multiplied by 2 equals 6.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the problem as:\n5 + 6\n\nFinally, we perform the addition. 5 + 6 equals 11.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 11."}]}]
