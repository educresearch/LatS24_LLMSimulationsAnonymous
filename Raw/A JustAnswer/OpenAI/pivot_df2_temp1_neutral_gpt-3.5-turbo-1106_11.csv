gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression, follow the order of operations, PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).

First, perform the operations within parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7.

Then, perform the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28.

Next, complete the subtraction:
28 + 12 = 40.

Lastly, perform the final multiplication and subtraction:
40 - 2*3 = 40 - 6 = 34.

So, the final answer is 34. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this expression, we use the order of operations (PEMDAS - Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction) to simplify the expression step by step.

First, we simplify within the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

Now we substitute back into the expression:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Now we perform the multiplication operations:
4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

And substitute back into the expression:
28 + 12 - 6

Now we perform the addition and subtraction:
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So the answer to the expression 4*(2+5)+12-2*3 is 34. 

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to use the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS. PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we need to solve the operations inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

Then, we perform the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now, we can perform the remaining operations:
28 + 12 - 6

Finally, we add and subtract to get the final answer:
28 + 12 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we need to follow the order of operations: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

The expression is: 4*(2+5)+12-2*3

Then, we multiply: 4*7 = 28

The expression becomes: 28+12-2*3

Now, we do the multiplication: 2*3 = 6

The expression becomes: 28+12-6

Lastly, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28+12 = 40, then 40-6 = 34

So, the final answer is 34.
