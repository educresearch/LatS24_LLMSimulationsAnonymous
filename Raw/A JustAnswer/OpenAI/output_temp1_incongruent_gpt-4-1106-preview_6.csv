systemPrompt4_userPrompt3_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this math problem, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations tells us the sequence in which we should perform the different operations in a math expression. The general rule can be remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:

- Parentheses
- Exponents (Powers and roots, etc.)
- Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
- Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

There are no parentheses or exponents in this problem, so we start with multiplication and division, then move to addition and subtraction.

Step 1: Perform the multiplication
4 * 3 = 12

Step 2: Add the result to 2
12 + 2 = 14

So, we performed the multiplication first and then the addition. 

The answer is 14."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this mathematics problem, we will use the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:

- Parentheses (P)
- Exponents (E)
- Multiplication and Division (MD, from left to right)
- Addition and Subtraction (AS, from left to right)

Now, let's apply this order to the problem:

4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3

1. Parentheses first:
   Inside the parentheses we have (2+5), so we calculate this first:
   2 + 5 = 7

   We now replace (2+5) with 7 in the expression:
   4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

2. Multiplication and Division next, from left to right:
   We have two multiplication operations here: 4 * 7 and 2 * 3.
   
   So, let's do those:
   4 * 7 = 28
   2 * 3 = 6

   Now, we replace the multiplications in the expression with these results:
   28 + 12 - 6

3. Lastly, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right:
   Start with 28 + 12:
   28 + 12 = 40
   
   Now we subtract 6:
   40 - 6 = 34

So, the final answer to the problem is 34.

The answer is 34."

The order of operations tells us which operations to perform first in a mathematical expression. The common acronym to remember this is PEMDAS:

P: Parentheses first
