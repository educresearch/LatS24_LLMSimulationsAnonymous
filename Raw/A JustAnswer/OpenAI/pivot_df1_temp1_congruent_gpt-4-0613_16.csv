gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Applying the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), we first do the multiplication and then the addition. 

So, we do 2*4 which equals 8. 

Then, we take the sum (5+8). 

Therefore, 5 + 2*4 equals 13.

The answer is 13."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: In this problem, you have:

7*2 = 14  (which is obtained by multiplying 7 and 2)
and 
8*5 = 40  (which is obtained by multiplying 8 and 5)

To get the total sum you add the two results:

14 + 40 = 54.

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: This is a simple arithmetic problem that can be solved step by step.

First, you should perform the multiplication operation,
which is 4*3 (4 times 3), to get a result of 12.

Then you add 2 to this result,
which is 12 + 2, to get a final answer of 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First step is to perform operations in parentheses according to the BODMAS rule.

4*(2 + 5) = 4*7 = 28

So, the expression (2+5) in the parentheses evaluates to 7 and hence the first part of the equation simplifies to 28.

In the second part, which is a subtraction operation, we need to do multiplication before subtraction, again according to the BODMAS rule. 

So, 12 - 2*3 = 12 - 6 = 6

Now, adding both parts:

28 + 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: In this arithmetic expression, we follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

The expression 5 + 3*2 involves both multiplication and addition. According to the order of operations, multiplication is performed before addition. 

First, we perform the multiplication: 3*2 equals 6.

Then, we add the result to 5: 5 + 6 equals 11.

So, the answer to the expression 5 + 3*2 is 11.

The answer is 11."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: In mathematics, when face with operations of both addition and multiplication, we follow the order of operations, also known as BIDMAS or PEMDAS, which stands for Brackets, Indices, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction. (Multiplication and Division are on the same level, as are Addition and Subtraction).

So, in this case we first perform the multiplication operation 2 * 4, which equals 8.
Then, we perform the addition operation 5 + 8, which equals 13.

The answer is 13."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: The expression given is 7*2 + 8*5.

To solve this, we perform the multiplication operations first due to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: In this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition, and Subtraction).

First, solve the expression in the parentheses (2 + 5), which equals 7.

Then, we have: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, do the multiplication 4 * 7, which equals 28 and 2 * 3, which equals 6.

Now, the expression simplifies to: 28 + 12 - 6.

Then, perform the subtraction 12 - 6, which equals 6.

Finally, add 28 + 6, and you'll have 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: In mathematics, when performing operations, there is an order that needs to be followed known as BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEDMAS.

B/B/P stands for Brackets/Orders/Parentheses, which is done first.
I/D (Indentation/Division) and M/M (Multiplication and Division) are done next, followed by A/S (Addition and Subtraction).

Using this order, we first perform the multiplication before the addition.

So 3*2 is done first which equals 6.
Then this is added to 5.

So the solution is 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we use the order of operations, which is defined as the BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEDMAS rule. The letters B/P, I/O, D/M, and A/S stand for Brackets/Parentheses, Indices/Orders (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.), Division/Multiplication (left-to-right), and Addition/Subtraction (left-to-right). 

According to the rule, Multiply or Divide before you Add or Subtract (unless there are parentheses or brackets to say otherwise). 

So in this problem, the first operation that should be done is the multiplication. 

Let's solve it:
5 + 2*4 
= 5 + 8 (Because 2*4 is equal to 8)
= 13

So the final answer is 13.

The answer is 13."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us the correct sequence to solve mathematical expressions. It is usually remembered by the abbreviation (or, more precisely, the ""acronym"") PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.), Multiplication and Division (left-to-right), Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right).

Given the problem 7*2 + 8*5, we must obey the order of operations identified by the acronym PEMDAS. 

First, we do the multiplication parts.

7*2 = 14
8*5 = 40

Then, we add the results together:

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we use the order of operations, which is commonly known by the acronym PEMDAS:

P: Parentheses first
E: Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
MD: Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)

In our case, we have multiplication and addition, 4*3 + 2. According to the order of operations, we need to perform the multiplication before the addition.

Let's do the multiplication:

4*3 = 12

Then, replace the multiplication product (12) in the expression and add 2:

12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: The order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) tells us to do Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Step 1: Solve the parentheses, (2 + 5) = 7.
So, the problem becomes 4*7 + 12 - 2*3.

Step 2: Solve the multiplication, 4*7 = 28 and 2*3 = 6.
So, the problem becomes 28 + 12 - 6.

Step 3: Solve addition and subtraction from left to right, 28 + 12 = 40 and then 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34."

In the problem, we don't have parentheses and exponents, but we do have multiplication and addition. We need to do the multiplication before the addition.

So first, we multiply:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

The new problem now is 14 + 40.

Then we do the addition:

14 + 40 = 54

So the final answer to the problem is 54.
