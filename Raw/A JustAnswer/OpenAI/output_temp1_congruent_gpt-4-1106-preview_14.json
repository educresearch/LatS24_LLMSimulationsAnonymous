Parentheses: Calculate the expression inside the parentheses first.\n   4*(2 + 5)\n   Inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7\n\n2. After the parentheses are simplified, we have:\n   4*7 + 12 - 2*3\n\n3. Next, we do the multiplication before addition and subtraction:\n   4*7 = 28\n   2*3 = 6\n\n4. Now the expression looks like:\n   28 + 12 - 6\n\n5. Finally, we do addition and subtraction from left to right:\n   28 + 12 = 40\n   40 - 6 = 34\n\nTherefore, after following the order of operations, we find that the expression simplifies to 34.\n\nThe answer is 34."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400", "model": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 400, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in grade 6 learning order of operations for the first time.\n                    Explain your solution to this given Mathematics problem, and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "5 + 3*2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: The order of operations in mathematics tells you which operations to perform first in an expression with more than one operation. The acronym PEMDAS is often used to remember the order: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nFor the expression 5 + 3*2, there are no parentheses or exponents, but there is multiplication and addition. According to the order of operations, you have to do the multiplication before the addition.\n\nSo first, you multiply 3 by 2:\n\n3 * 2 = 6\n\nThen you add that result to 5:\n\n5 + 6 = 11\n\nSo the final answer is 11. \n\nThe answer is 11."}]}]
