gpt-4-0613,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), which stands for Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders (i.e. powers and square roots, etc.), Multiplication and Division (left-to-right), Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right), you should first solve the operation inside the parentheses, followed by multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction.

Step 1: Solve the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7

Your equation then will look like this: 4*7 + 12 - 2*3

Step 2: Then solve the multiplication: 4*7 = 28 and 2*3 = 6

Now the equation will look like this: 28 + 12 - 6

Step 3: Solve addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40, and then subtract 6 from it to get 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve the given mathematical problem, we can use the order of operations expressed by the acronym ""PEMDAS/BODMAS"" which stands for Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Following these steps:

step 1: solve the parentheses:
4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3 => 4*7 + 12 - 2*3

step 2: do the multiplication:
4*7 + 12 - 2*3 => 28 + 12 - 6

step 3: perform the addition and the subtraction (from left to right):
28 + 12 - 6 => 40 - 6 => 34 

So, the answer to the given problem is 34. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: In the given operation, 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3, we have to follow the order of operations which is BIDMAS/BODMAS:
B/B stand for Brackets/Orders,
I/O stand for Indices/Of,
D/D stand for Division/Division,
M/M stand for Multiplication/Multiplication,
A/A stand for Addition/Addition, and
S/S stand for Subtraction/Subtraction

So, first we have to solve the operation within the brackets (2 + 5) = 7

So, our expression/equation becomes:
4*7 + 12 - 2*3

Secondly, we have to do the multiplication operation:
4*7 = 28
2*3 = 6

So, it becomes: 
28 + 12 - 6

Finally, we perform the addition and subtraction operations:
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, in order to solve this problem, we need remember the order of operations, which is commonly referred to as PEMDAS or BIDMAS. PEMDAS is an acronym for Parentheses (or Brackets), Exponents (or Indices), Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

We then solve any operations in parentheses or brackets first. Our example problem gives us 2 + 5 inside the parentheses, which equals 7.

So, we rewrite our problem, replacing the parentheses with the number 7: 

4*7 + 12 - 2*3

Next, the order of operation tells us to do multiplication and division from left to right. We have two multiplication operations in our problem: 4*7 and 2*3. 

4*7 equals 28 and 2*3 equals 6.

Now, we rewrite our problem again: 

28 + 12 - 6.

The last operations left are addition and subtraction, which we also do from left to right. 

We have the addition operation 28 + 12 first, which equals 40. 

We rewrite our problem one more time:

40 - 6 

Lastly, we perform the subtraction operation 40 - 6, which gives us 34.

The answer is 34."
