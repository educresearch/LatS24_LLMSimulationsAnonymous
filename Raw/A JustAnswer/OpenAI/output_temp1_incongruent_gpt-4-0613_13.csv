This rule can be remembered with the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

The given math problem is ""5 + 3 * 2"". 

Here, we first look for parentheses, and exponents. Since there are none, we proceed to multiplication or division. In this case, we multiply 3 and 2 together. 

3 * 2 equals 6.

Then, we replace ""3 * 2"" with the result of the multiplication, which is 6. The equation now becomes 5 + 6.

Finally, we proceed to addition. Adding 5 and 6 together, we get 11. 

So, the solution to the math problem ""5 + 3 * 2"", according to the order of operations, is 11.

The answer is 11."
