systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-1106_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), which is commonly remembered with the acronym PEMDAS.

In this problem, we don't have any parentheses or exponents, so we move to the next step. According to the order of operations, we should first perform the multiplication, and then the addition.

So, 3 * 2 equals 6.

Then, we add 5 to 6, which equals 11.

Therefore, the answer is 11."
