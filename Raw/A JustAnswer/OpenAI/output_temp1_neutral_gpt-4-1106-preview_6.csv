systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:

P - Parentheses first
E - Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
MD - Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS - Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

Now, let's apply it to the expression 4*(2+5)+12-2*3:

1. Parentheses first:
   Inside the parentheses we have (2+5). We add these two numbers together.
   2 + 5 = 7

2. Now the expression is:
   4*7 + 12 - 2*3

3. There are no exponents, so we move to multiplication and division:
   Multiply 4 by 7:
   4 * 7 = 28

   Multiply 2 by 3:
   2 * 3 = 6

4. Our expression is now:
   28 + 12 - 6

5. Now we just have addition and subtraction left, which we do from left to right:
   Add 28 and 12:
   28 + 12 = 40

   Subtract 6 from the result:
   40 - 6 = 34

So, the final answer is 34.
The answer is 34."

AS: Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Since there are no parentheses, exponents, or division in this problem, we just have to deal with multiplication and addition.

First, we will do the multiplication part:

3 * 2 = 6

Now we have the addition part left:

5 + 6 = 11

So the answer is 11."
