gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this expression, we must follow the order of operations known as PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we calculate inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.

Next, we perform the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28.

Then, we compute the multiplication and subtraction: 2 * 3 = 6, and 12 - 6 = 6.

Finally, we add the results of the multiplication and subtraction: 28 + 6 = 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this expression, we need to follow the order of operations (also known as PEMDAS).

First, we deal with any parentheses. In this case, there are no parentheses.

Next, we tackle any exponents. There are no exponents in this expression.

Moving on, we have multiplication and division from left to right. In this case, we have 4 multiplied by the sum of 2 and 5, which is 7. So, we have 4 multiplied by 7.

Now we have addition and subtraction from left to right. After multiplying 4 by 7, we get 28. Next, we have 28 plus 12, which gives us 40. Finally, we have 40 minus 2 multiplied by 3. We need to perform multiplication before subtraction, so 2 multiplied by 3 is 6. Now we have 40 minus 6, which gives us 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS. PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Inside the parentheses, we have the expression 2+5, which equals 7.
   So, the expression becomes: 4*(7)+12-2*3

2. Next, we perform the multiplication from left to right. 
   4 multiplied by 7 equals 28.
   So, the expression becomes: 28+12-2*3

3. Next, we perform the multiplication: 2 multiplied by 3 equals 6.
   So, the expression becomes: 28+12-6

4. Now, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.
   28 plus 12 equals 40.
   So, the expression becomes: 40-6

5. Finally, we perform the subtraction: 40 minus 6 equals 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem using the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), we need to follow the correct order of operations.

Let's break down the given expression step by step:

First, we should simplify the expression within the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7.

Now the expression becomes:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, we perform the multiplication from left to right:
4 * 7 = 28,
2 * 3 = 6.

After applying the multiplication operation, the expression becomes:

28 + 12 - 6.

Now, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
28 + 12 = 40,
40 - 6 = 34.
