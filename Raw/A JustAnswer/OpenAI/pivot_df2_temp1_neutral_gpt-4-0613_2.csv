gpt-4-0613,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: The order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, dictates that multiplication and division should be done before addition and subtraction. The acronym stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

Let's follow that order:

Step 1: (2+5) = 7
Step 2: 4*7 = 28
Step 3: 2*3 = 6 

So the problem now becomes 28 + 12 - 6.

Step 4: 28 + 12 = 40
Step 5: 40 - 6 = 34 

So,

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: The first step in this solution is applying the order of operations, which is remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parenthesis, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

Step 1: You're first supposed to simplify everything inside parentheses. Hence, (2 + 5) would be 7.

The expression would be:
4*(7) + 12 - 2*3

Step 2: The next step involves multiplication and division, from left to right. 

You start by multiplying 4 by 7, which yields 28. Then subtract 2 multiplied by 3 (6) from the result.

The expression looks like this now:
28 + 12 - 6

Step 3: Finally, you perform addition and subtraction operations from left to right.

First, add 28 to 12, getting 40. Once that's done, subtract 6 from the result.

The final answer would then be:
The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we must follow the BIDMAS/BODMAS (Brackets, Indices/Orders, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)) rule, which is the order of operations.

The problem is: 4*(2+5)+12-2*3

1. First, perform the addition inside the parentheses (brackets):
4*(2+5) can be simplified to 4*7.

So the new expression is: 4*7+12-2*3

2. Second, perform the multiplication:
4*7 can be simplified to 28 and 2*3 simplifies to 6.

So the new expression is: 28+12-6

3. Lastly, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
28+12 is 40 and 40-6 is 34.

So, 4*(2+5)+12-2*3 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I'm going to do the operation inside the parentheses first following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) which stands for Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction.

Looking at the problem, (2 + 5) is inside the parentheses, so I do that first. The sum of 2 + 5 is 7.

So the problem now becomes 4*7+12-2*3.

Next, according to order of operations, I do the multiplication before addition and subtraction.

Multiplying 4*7 equals 28. 

Multiplying 2*3 equals 6. 

So now the equation is 28+12-6.

Lastly, I can now perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.

Adding 28+12 equals 40. 

Then subtract 6 from 40 equals to 34.

So, the answer is 34."
