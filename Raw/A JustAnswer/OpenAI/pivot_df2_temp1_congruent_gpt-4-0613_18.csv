   The equation now reads: 28 + 12 - 6.

4. Addition and Subtraction:
   Solve addition operation first: 28 + 12 = 40, 
   And then carry out the subtraction: 40 - 6 = 34.

So, the answer to this equation 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3 is 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we need to do the operations in parentheses. So we add 2 and 5, which equals 7.

4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3 becomes 4*7 + 12 - 2*3.

Next, in the order of operations, we have to do the multiplication before addition or subtraction. 

So, we multiply 4 and 7 to get 28.

Our equation now is 28 + 12 - 2*3.

Next, we also multiply 2 and 3 to get 6. 

Our equation simplifies to 28 + 12 - 6.

Now, we perform the addition operation which is 28 plus 12 to get 40.

So the equation simplifies to 40 - 6.

After that, we subtract 6 from 40 to get our final answer.
