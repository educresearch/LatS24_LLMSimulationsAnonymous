gpt-4-0613,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, let's start by doing the operation inside the parenthesis.

2 + 5 = 7

Next, multiply the result by 4 (due to order of operations, multiplication comes before addition or subtraction).

4 * 7 = 28

Then, subtract twice of three from 12:

12 - 2 * 3 = 12 - 6 = 6

Finally, add the two results together:

28 + 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we solve the operations inside the parentheses, following the order of operations rule (PEMDAS/BODMAS) which implies Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction.

We have:

4*(2+5)+12-2*3 

This simplifies to:

4*7+12-2*3

Next, we do the multiplication operations:

28+12-6

Then, we do the addition and subtraction:

40-6

Finally, we get:

34

So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: We can solve the problem following the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Given problem: 4*(2+5)+12-2*3

Step 1: Solve the operation inside parentheses (2+5)
4*(7)+12-2*3

Step 2: Perform multiplication and division from left to right.
28+12-2*3

Step 3: Still following multiplication since there is multiplication operation on the right.
28+12-6

Step 4: Lastly perform addition and subtraction from left to right.
40-6

Step 5: Continuation from previous step
34

So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we start by doing the operations inside the parentheses because the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) says that we must do parentheses (brackets) first. Here, inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5.

2 + 5 = 7.

We then substitute this back into the problem, which becomes:

4*7 + 12 - 2*3 

Next, we handle the multiplication parts because MDAS/BODMAS tells us to perform multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. First, we multiply 4 by 7.

4 * 7 = 28. 

And then we also multiply 2 by 3.

2 * 3 = 6.

Our expression now looks like this:

28 + 12 - 6

Finally, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40

And then,

40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
