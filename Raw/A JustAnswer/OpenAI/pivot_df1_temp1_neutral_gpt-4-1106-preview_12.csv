P: Parentheses first
E: Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
MD: Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS: Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

So first, we'll deal with the parentheses:

4*(2+5)+12-2*3

Inside the parentheses we have 2 + 5 which equals 7. So we replace 2+5 with 7:

4*7+12-2*3

Next, we'll do the multiplication. There are two multiplication operations:

4*7 = 28
2*3 = 6

Let's replace those in the expression:

28+12-6

Now we just have addition and subtraction left, which we'll do from left to right:

First the addition:

28+12 = 40

Now replace that in the expression:

40-6

Finally, the subtraction:

40-6 = 34
