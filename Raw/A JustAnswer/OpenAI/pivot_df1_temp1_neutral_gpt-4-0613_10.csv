gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: This problem can be solved by keeping in mind the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.), Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Following order of operations:

Firstly, solve the operation in parenthesis: 2+5 = 7.

Then, multiply 4 with 7 (the result of the operation in parentheses): 4*7 = 28.

In the remaining equation, the multiplication operation comes first: 2*3 = 6.

Now subtract the result from 12: 12-6 = 6.

Finally, add this result to 28 (the result of first multiplication): 28+6 = 34.

So, 4*(2+5)+12-2*3 = 34.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: The given expression is 4*(2+5)+12-2*3. 

We can start solving this by using the order of operations or BIDMAS/PEDMAS rule. This rule states that expressions should be solved in the following order: Brackets/parentheses, Indices/Exponents or powers, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we need to solve the operation in brackets, which is 2+5 that results in 7.

Now the expression becomes as: 4*7+12-2*3

Then, we perform the multiplication operations from left to right. 

4*7 gives 28, and 2*3 gives 6.

So, the expression turns into: 28+12-6

Finally, we compute the addition and subtraction operations from left to right.

28+12 gives 40 and then subtract 6 from that, which results in 34. 

So, the final result is 34.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: The order of operations, also known as BIDMAS or PEMDAS, requires that we calculate anything inside brackets (B or P) first, then indices or powers/exponents (I or E), followed by division and multiplication (DM), and lastly addition and subtraction (AS).

Applying that to this problem:

Start with 4*(2+5)+12-2*3

First, do the operation inside the parentheses (2 + 5), which equals 7:

It's now: 4*7+12-2*3

Next, do the multiplication 4*7 which equals 28:

It's now: 28+12-2*3

Then, do the next multiplication operation 2*3 which equals 6:

It's now: 28+12-6

Now, do the addition (28+12) which equals 40:

It's now: 40-6

Finally, do the subtraction (40 - 6), which equals 34:

So the final answer is 34.

So,

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: The problem given is 5 + 3 * 2. 

When performing order of operations, we follow the rule called ""PEMDAS/BODMAS"": 

P/B - Parentheses first
E/O - Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
