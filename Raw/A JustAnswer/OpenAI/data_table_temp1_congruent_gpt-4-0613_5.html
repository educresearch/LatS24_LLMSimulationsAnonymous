      <td>GPT Response: Firstly, I find the sums in the brackets because of the BIDMAS/BODMAS rule that says Brackets/Orders (Indices) are done first, followed by Division and Multiplication (from left to right) and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). So, 2 + 5 equals 7.<br><br>Then I multiply the result by 4 because multiplication comes before addition and subtraction in the order of operations. So, 4 times 7 is 28.<br><br>Then I subtract 2 times 3 from 12 because multiplication comes before subtraction. So, 2 times 3 is 6, and 12 minus 6 is 6. <br><br>Lastly, I add the two results together. So, 28 plus 6 equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
