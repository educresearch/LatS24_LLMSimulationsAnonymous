systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the rules of order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS. PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this problem, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we start by performing any multiplication or division from left to right. 

The multiplication is 3 * 2, which equals 6.

Now we have 5 + 6. 

Finally, we can perform the addition, which gives us 11.

Therefore, the answer is 11."
