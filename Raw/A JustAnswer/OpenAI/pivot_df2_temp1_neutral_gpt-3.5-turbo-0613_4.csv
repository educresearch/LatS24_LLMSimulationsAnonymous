gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS. 

1. First, we need to calculate inside the parentheses: (2+5) = 7. 

2. Next, we perform multiplication: 4*(2+5) = 4*7 = 28. 

3. Then, we calculate any remaining multiplication or division from left to right: 28-2*3 = 28-6 = 22. 

4. Finally, we perform addition or subtraction from left to right: 22+12 = 34. 

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS). 

Step 1: Simplify parentheses
Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5 = 7. 

So, the expression becomes:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Step 2: Perform multiplication and division from left to right
Multiplying 4 by 7, we get 28.

So, the expression becomes:

28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Multiplying 2 by 3, we get 6.

So, the expression becomes:

28 + 12 - 6

Step 3: Perform addition and subtraction from left to right
Adding 28 and 12, we get 40.

So, the expression becomes:

40 - 6

Lastly, subtracting 6 from 40 gives us the final answer:

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS. PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we evaluate any operations inside parentheses. In this case, there is the expression (2+5). We add 2 and 5 to get 7, so the expression becomes 4*(7)+12-2*3.

Next, we perform any multiplication and division from left to right. We multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. So the expression becomes 28+12-2*3.

Finally, we do any addition and subtraction from left to right. We add 28 and 12, which equals 40. So the expression becomes 40-2*3.

Next, we multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. So the expression becomes 40-6.

Finally, we subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS. PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division (from left to right), and Addition/Subtraction (from left to right).

In our expression, let's start by simplifying within the parentheses first. Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5, which equals 7. 

Now we rewrite our expression: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, we perform the multiplication. Starting from the left, we have 4 * 7, which equals 28. 

Now our expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Finally, we perform the multiplication on the remaining part of the expression, which is 2 * 3. That equals 6.

Now our expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 6.

Lastly, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right. Starting with the addition, we have 28 + 12, which equals 40.

Now our expression becomes: 40 - 6.

Finally, we perform the subtraction, 40 - 6, which equals 34.
