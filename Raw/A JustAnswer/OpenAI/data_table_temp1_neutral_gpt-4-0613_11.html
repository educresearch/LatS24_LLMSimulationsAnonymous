      <td>GPT Response: First, you should follow the order of operations. This is usually remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.), Multiplication and Division (left-to-right), Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right).<br><br>So, the expression should be simplified as follows:<br><br>1. Evaluate the expression in parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.<br>2. Multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28.<br>3. Again Multiplication: 2 * 3 = 6.<br>4. Addition: 28 + 12 = 40.<br>5. Finally, subtraction: 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>So, 4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

This can be easily remembered with the acronym PEMDAS.<br><br>During this operation, the very first thing we need to do is solve the operation inside the parentheses, which is (2+5).<br><br>2+5 equals 7.<br><br>Now our equation is 4*7+12-2*3.<br><br>The next step is to complete multiplication or division operations. So, we need to multiply 4 times 7, which gives us 28, and multiply 2 times 3, which gives us 6.<br><br>Now our equation is 28+12-6.<br><br>Finally, the order of operations tells us to perform addition and subtraction from left to right. So, 28 plus 12 gives us 40 and then we subtract 6 from it. This gives us the final answer.<br><br>So the answer to 4*(2+5)+12-2*3 when using the order of operations is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

We have two multiplication parts here, 4*7 and 2*3. Let's compute these:<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>Put these in the original operation:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Finally, the order of operations tells us to do addition before subtraction:<br><br>First, let's add 28 + 12 = 40<br><br>Lastly, let's subtract 6 from 40:<br><br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So, after all the steps, we get the final answer. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
