      <td>GPT Response: First, you should follow the order of operations. This is usually remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.), Multiplication and Division (left-to-right), Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right).<br><br>So, the expression should be simplified as follows:<br><br>1. Evaluate the expression in parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.<br>2. Multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28.<br>3. Again Multiplication: 2 * 3 = 6.<br>4. Addition: 28 + 12 = 40.<br>5. Finally, subtraction: 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>So, 4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: The problem is 4*(2+5)+12-2*3. <br><br>In order to solve the problem, we must follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This can be easily remembered with the acronym PEMDAS.<br><br>During this operation, the very first thing we need to do is solve the operation inside the parentheses, which is (2+5).<br><br>2+5 equals 7.<br><br>Now our equation is 4*7+12-2*3.<br><br>The next step is to complete multiplication or division operations. So, we need to multiply 4 times 7, which gives us 28, and multiply 2 times 3, which gives us 6.<br><br>Now our equation is 28+12-6.<br><br>Finally, the order of operations tells us to perform addition and subtraction from left to right. So, 28 plus 12 gives us 40 and then we subtract 6 from it. This gives us the final answer.<br><br>So the answer to 4*(2+5)+12-2*3 when using the order of operations is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

We have two multiplication parts here, 4*7 and 2*3. Let's compute these:<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>Put these in the original operation:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Finally, the order of operations tells us to do addition before subtraction:<br><br>First, let's add 28 + 12 = 40<br><br>Lastly, let's subtract 6 from 40:<br><br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So, after all the steps, we get the final answer. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
