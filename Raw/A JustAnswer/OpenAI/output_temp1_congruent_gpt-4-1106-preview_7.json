The order of operations can be remembered using the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nFor the given problem:\n\n5 + 3 * 2\n\nThere are no parentheses or exponents to deal with, so we start with multiplication and division. We have one multiplication to do, which is 3 times 2. Let's do that first.\n\n3 * 2 = 6\n\nNow we replace the original multiplication with the result in the expression:\n\n5 + 6\n\nNext, we perform the addition:\n\n5 + 6 = 11\n\nSo the solution to the problem is 11.\n\nThe answer is 11."}]}]
