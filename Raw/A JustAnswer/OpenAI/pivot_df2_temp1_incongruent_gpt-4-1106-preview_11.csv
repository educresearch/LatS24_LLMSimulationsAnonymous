gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Let's solve the expression step by step, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):

1. Brackets/parentheses
2. Exponents (none here)
3. Multiplication and division from left to right
4. Addition and subtraction from left to right

Expression: 4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3

First handle the parentheses:
4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3
= 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, handle the multiplication:
= 28 + 12 - 6

Now, proceed with the addition and subtraction from left to right:
= 40 - 6
= 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Let's solve the given mathematical expression step by step, following the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS/BODMAS (Parentheses/Brackets, Orders (i.e. powers and square roots, etc.), Division and Multiplication (left-to-right), Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)).

The expression provided is:

4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3

First, we need to solve the operation within the parentheses:

(2+5) = 7

Now the expression looks like this:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we address the multiplication:

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now our expression is:

28 + 12 - 6

Next, we go left to right for the addition and subtraction:

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So the final answer is:

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Let's solve the problem step by step using the order of operations. The order of operations is commonly remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for:

- Parentheses
- Exponents
- Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
- Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Now, let's apply the order of operations to the expression:

4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3

Step 1: Calculate inside the parentheses.
2+5 = 7

Step 2: Now, replace the sum inside the parentheses with 7 and rewrite the expression:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Step 3: Next, we perform the multiplications.

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now replace the multiplication results into the expression:

28 + 12 - 6

Step 4: Finally, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right.

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

The final answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this math problem, I'll use the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:

P - Parentheses first
E - Exponents (powers and square roots, etc.)
MD - Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
