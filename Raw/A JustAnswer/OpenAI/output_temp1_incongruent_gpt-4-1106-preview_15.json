Inside the parentheses, we simply add 2 and 5:\n   \\( 4 \\times 7 + 12 - 2 \\times 3 \\)\n\n3. Next, we do the multiplication:\n   \\( (4 \\times 7) + 12 - (2 \\times 3) \\)\n   \\( 28 + 12 - 6 \\)\n\n4. Then, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n   \\( 28 + 12 = 40 \\)\n   Then, \\( 40 - 6 = 34 \\)\n\nSo, the final answer to the problem \\( 4 \\times (2+5) + 12 - 2 \\times 3 \\) is 34.\n\nThe answer is 34."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400", "model": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 400, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in grade 6 learning order of operations for the first time.\n                    Explain your solution to this given Mathematics problem, and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "5+3 * 2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: To solve this math problem, you need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:\n\n- P for Parentheses\n- E for Exponents (powers and square roots, etc.)\n- MD for Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)\n- AS for Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)\n\nSince there are no parentheses, exponents, division, or subtraction in this problem, only multiplication and addition, you start with the multiplication, which comes before addition in the order of operations.\n\nSo here's how you would solve it:\n\n1.
