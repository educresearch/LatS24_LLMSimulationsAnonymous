      <td>GPT Response: We will follow the order of operations, which is parentheses first, then multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally addition and subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>1. Calculate inside the parentheses first:<br>   2 + 5 = 7<br><br>2. Now multiply the result by 4:<br>   4 * 7 = 28<br><br>3. Subtract the last part of the equation:<br>   2 * 3 = 6<br><br>4. Now write down what we have after using the parentheses and doing the multiplications:<br>   28 + 12 - 6<br><br>5. Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:<br>   28 + 12 = 40<br>   40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So the final answer is 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
