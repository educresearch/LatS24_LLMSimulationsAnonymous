The problem you've provided doesn't have any parentheses, exponents, or division. It does have multiplication (4 * 3) and addition (+2). According to PEMDAS, we need to do the multiplication before we do the addition.

First, we multiply 4 by 3:
4 * 3 = 12

Now, we add 2 to the result:
12 + 2 = 14

So, the final answer is:
The answer is 14."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the given math problem, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations helps us solves math equations in the correct way so that everyone gets the same answer. The order is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:

P: Parentheses first
E: Exponents (i.e., powers and square roots, etc.)
MD: Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS: Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

Now let's solve the problem by following these steps:

4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3

First, we solve anything inside parentheses:
2+5 = 7

Now, we replace the sum we found back into the original equation:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we do the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Replace the products back into the equation:
28 + 12 - 6

Now, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

There are no more operations to perform, so the final answer is:
The answer is 34."

The problem you've given is:

5 + 3 * 2

According to PEMDAS, we have to perform multiplication before addition. So let's do that.

First, we multiply 3 by 2:

3 * 2 = 6

Now, we add that result to 5:

5 + 6 = 11

So the answer is:

The answer is 11."
