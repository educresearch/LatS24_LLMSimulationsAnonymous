gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, we need to follow the order of operations, which in mathematics is known as PEMDAS/BODMAS (Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction). Here's how we solve this problem step by step:

1. Parentheses first: calculate the expression within the brackets (2 + 5).
2 + 5 = 7

2. Multiplication and division next: Now we multiply the result from the parentheses by 4 and multiply 2 by 3.
4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

3. Now perform the addition and subtraction: Add 28 and 12, then subtract the result of 2 * 3 (which is 6).
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So the final answer is:

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we will follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This rule is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.

Given the expression: 4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3

We start by performing the operation inside the parentheses first:

(2 + 5) = 7

Now we have: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we'll do the multiplication:

4 * 7 = 28

2 * 3 = 6

Now our expression looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

Then we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40

And then:

40 - 6 = 34

So the final answer is 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure, let's solve this step by step according to the order of operations. The order of operations is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:

P stands for Parentheses
E stands for Exponents (including roots, like square roots)
MD stands for Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
AS stands for Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Now, let's solve the given problem:

4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3

Step 1: Solve the expression within the parentheses first (P):
2 + 5 = 7

Step 2: Now the expression looks like this:
4*7 + 12 - 2*3

Step 3: Perform the multiplication (MD):
4*7 = 28
2*3 = 6

Now substitute back into the expression:
28 + 12 - 6

Step 4: Now, simply perform the addition and subtraction from left to right (AS):
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So the final answer is:
The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this math problem, we need to follow the rules of the order of operations. This set of rules is often remembered by the abbreviation PEMDAS:

- Parentheses
- Exponents (we don't have any exponents in this problem)
- Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
- Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we need to do the calculations inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

Now the equation looks like this:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we do the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28
and
2 * 3 = 6

So, we update the equation:
28 + 12 - 6

Now we can do the addition and subtraction from left to right:
28 + 12 = 40

And subtracting:
40 - 6 = 34

There are no more operations left to do, so the final answer is:
