systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-1106_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is also known as BODMAS or PEMDAS. 

BODMAS stands for:
B - Brackets
O - Orders (i.e. powers and square roots, etc.)
D - Division and Multiplication (from left to right)
A - Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

PEMDAS stands for:
P - Parentheses
E - Exponents
M - Multiplication
D - Division
A - Addition
S - Subtraction

In our problem, we have to do the multiplication before the addition, so we will first multiply 3 and 2, and then add 5 to the product.

So, 3 * 2 equals 6.

Then, we add 5 to 6, and the answer is 11.

So, the answer is 11."
