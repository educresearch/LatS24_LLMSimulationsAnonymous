Parentheses first:\n   Inside the parentheses we have (2+5). We add these two numbers together.\n   2 + 5 = 7\n\n2. Now the expression is:\n   4*7 + 12 - 2*3\n\n3. There are no exponents, so we move to multiplication and division:\n   Multiply 4 by 7:\n   4 * 7 = 28\n\n   Multiply 2 by 3:\n   2 * 3 = 6\n\n4. Our expression is now:\n   28 + 12 - 6\n\n5. Now we just have addition and subtraction left, which we do from left to right:\n   Add 28 and 12:\n   28 + 12 = 40\n\n   Subtract 6 from the result:\n   40 - 6 = 34\n\nSo, the final answer is 34.\nThe answer is 34."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400", "model": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 400, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in grade 6 learning order of operations for the first time.\n                    Explain your solution to this given Mathematics problem, and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "5+3*2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: In order to solve the math problem 5 + 3 * 2, we need to follow the order of operations, which can be remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:\n\nP: Parentheses first\nE: Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)\nMD: Multiplication and Division (from left to right)\nAS: Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)\n\nSince there are no parentheses, exponents, or division in this problem, we just have to deal with multiplication and addition.\n\nFirst, we will do the multiplication part:\n\n3 * 2 = 6\n\nNow we have the addition part left:\n\n5 + 6 = 11\n\nSo the answer is 11."}]}]
