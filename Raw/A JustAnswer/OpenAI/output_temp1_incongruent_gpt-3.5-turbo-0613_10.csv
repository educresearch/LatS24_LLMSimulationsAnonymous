4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now, let's rewrite the expression with the results:

28 + 12 - 6

Finally, we'll perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

Therefore, the answer is 34."

First, we need to multiply 3 and 2. 

3 * 2 = 6

Now, we can add 5 and 6 together. 

5 + 6 = 11

Therefore, the answer is 11."
