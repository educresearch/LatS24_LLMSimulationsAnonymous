systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-1106_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

In the expression 5+3*2, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we move to the multiplication. 
3*2 equals 6.

So, the expression becomes 5+6.

Now, we add 5 and 6 together.
5+6 equals 11.

So, the final answer is 11. 
Therefore, the answer is 11."
