gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we can use the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS (parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction). 

First, we calculate the expression inside the parentheses (2 + 5) which equals 7. 

Next, we multiply 4 by the result of the sum inside the parentheses, so 4 * 7 equals 28. 

Then, we perform the multiplication 2 * 3, which equals 6. 

Now, we add the remaining numbers: 28 + 12 - 6 equals 34. 

Therefore, the final answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we should follow the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS. 

PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

Let's break down the expression step by step: 

1. First, we perform the addition inside the parentheses: 

   2 + 5 = 7 

2. Next, we multiply 4 by the sum we calculated in the previous step: 

   4 * 7 = 28 

3. Then, we move on to the subtraction: 

   12 - 2 = 10 

4. Finally, we multiply 2 by 3: 

   2 * 3 = 6 

Now, we can subtract the result from step 4 from the result from step 3: 

   10 - 6 = 4

Finally, we subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34.

Therefore, the final answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is commonly remembered using the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).
Let's simplify the expression step by step:

Step 1: Look for any parentheses and simplify them first. There are parentheses in the expression (2+5):
2+5 = 7

Now the expression becomes: 4*(7)+12-2*3

Step 2: Now, focus on the multiplication and division operations from left to right. The expression has two multiplications: 4*(7) and 2*3.
4*(7) = 28
2*3 = 6

After simplifying the multiplication, the expression becomes: 28+12-6

Step 3: Now, we can focus on the addition and subtraction operations from left to right. The expression has two additions: 28+12 and 12-6.
28+12 = 40
12-6 = 6

After simplifying the addition and subtraction, the expression becomes: 40-6

Step 4: Now, perform the remaining subtraction operation. 40-6 = 34

So, the final answer to the expression 4*(2+5)+12-2*3 is: 34.
The answer is 34."
