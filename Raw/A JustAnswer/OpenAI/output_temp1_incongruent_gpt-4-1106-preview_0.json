Parentheses first:\n   Calculate the expression inside the parentheses (2+5), which equals 7.\n\n   So now the expression looks like this:\n   4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3\n\n2. Now we do the Multiplication and Division as they appear from left to right:\n   Multiply 4 by 7 to get 28.\n   Multiply 2 by 3 to get 6.\n\n   The expression is now:\n   28 + 12 - 6\n\n3. Finally, we do Addition and Subtraction from left to right:\n   Add 28 and 12 to get 40.\n   Subtract 6 from 40 to get 34.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the final answer is:\nThe answer is 34."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400", "model": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 400, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in grade 6 learning order of operations for the first time.\n                    Explain your solution to this given Mathematics problem, and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "5+3 * 2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: To solve the math problem 5 + 3 * 2, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations can be remembered using the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nThe problem does not have any parentheses, exponents, or division, so we will focus on the multiplication and addition parts.\n\nAccording to the order of operations, we do multiplication before addition. So we start by multiplying 3 by 2.\n\n3 * 2 = 6\n\nNow we have the result of the multiplication, which is 6, and we can add it to 5.\n\n5 + 6 = 11\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 11.\n\nThe answer is 11."}]}]
