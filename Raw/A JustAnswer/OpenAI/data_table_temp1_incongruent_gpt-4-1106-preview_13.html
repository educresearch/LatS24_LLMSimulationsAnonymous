The order of operations is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>Let's solve the problem step by step following the order of operations:<br><br>1. Parentheses: First we should calculate the expression within the parentheses `(2+5)`:<br>   4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3<br>   = 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>2.

Addition and Subtraction: Finally, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:<br>   28 + 12 - 6<br>   = 40 - 6<br>   = 34<br><br>So after following the order of operations, the final answer is:<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
