gpt-4-0613,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, we need to follow the order of operations, which can be remembered with the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

Step 1: Parentheses 
4 * (2+5) => 4 * 7  
  
Step 2: Multiplication  (4 * 7) 
4 * 7 = 28 

So, the equation becomes 28 + 12 - 2 * 3 

Step 3: Multiplication and Addition/Subtraction (from left to right), 

28 + 12 = 40. 
So, we get: 
40 - 2 * 3 

Then we multiply
2 * 3 = 6
So, we get:
40 - 6 

Finally, we subtract and get:
40 - 6 = 34

The final equation reads as 34.
 
The answer is 34.","GPT Response: We solve this equation by following the order of operations, which is usually remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

We first deal with the parentheses expression:

2 + 5 = 7

Then the equation becomes:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we perform multiplication:

4 * 7 = 28

2 * 3 = 6

Then the equation becomes:

28 + 12 - 6

Finally, we perform addition and subtraction operations:

28 + 12 = 40

40 - 6 = 34

So, 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: In Mathematics, the order of operations rule is given by the acronym BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEDMAS which stands for Brackets/Order or Parentheses/Exponents, Division/Multiplication (from left to right), Addition/Subtraction (from left to right).

Applying this rule to 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3:

1. First, we deal with the Brackets: 
   So, (2+5) = 7

2. Then, replace this back into the equation, we get:
   So, 4 * 7+12-2 * 3

3. Next, we do the multiplication and division from left to right:
   We have two multiplication operations,  so,
   4*7 = 28
   2*3 = 6
   
4. Substitute these values back into the equation: 
   28+12-6

5. Lastly, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 
   First, 28+12 gives 40
   Then, 40-6 equals 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we have to solve what's inside the parentheses. This is because according to the order of operations, brackets or parentheses (Brackets) come first before any other operations. So, 2+5 equals 7.

Next, we do any multiplication and division, from left to right (Orders). That's the O in BIDMAS. That will give us 4*7 and 2*3 which simplifies to 28 and 6 respectively.

After that, we do all addition and subtraction, from left to right (Addition/Subtraction). We have three operations here. Adding 12 to 28 gives 40, and subtracting 6 from 40 gives 34.

So the worked out solution looks something like this:

4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3
= 4*7 + 12 - 2*3
= 28 + 12 - 6
= 40 - 6
= 34

So, the answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: According to the order of operations, or BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEDMAS, multiplication and division should be carried out before addition and subtraction.

Here, you should first perform the multiplication part, which is 4*3 = 12.

Next, add the result to 2, which is 12+2 = 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: In mathematics, the order of operations, often abbreviated as BIDMAS or PEMDAS, is used to prioritize certain types of operations over others. BIDMAS stands for Brackets, Indices, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), while PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.), Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Given the mathematical problem ""4 * 3 + 2"":

- First, we perform the multiplication operation: 4 * 3 = 12
- Then, we perform the addition operation with the result: 12 + 2 = 14

So, the solution to the given mathematical problem is 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: This problem uses the order of operations, which is also known as BODMAS or PEMDAS. 

The order of operations is a set of rules that determines the order in which we perform mathematical operations so that we get the same result each time. The operations are performed in this order: 

1. Brackets (or Parentheses)
2. Orders or Exponents (or Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
3. Division and Multiplication (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

In your problem, you have multiplication (4 * 3) and addition (3 + 2), no brackets, orders or exponents, or parentheses. 

So first, we do multiplication because division and multiplication come before addition and subtraction in the order of operations. 

Multiply 4 and 3: 

4 * 3 = 12 

So your problem now looks like this: 

12 + 2 

Now, finally, the only operation left is addition. 

Add 12 and 2: 

12 + 2 = 14

So the answer to your problem is 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: In the order of operations, you always do multiplication or division before you do addition or subtraction. This is remembered using the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

4 * 3 is 12.

After that, you add 2 to this result.

12 + 2 is 14.

So, the solution to the problem ""4 * 3 + 2"" is 14.

First, do the multiplication:
2 * 4 = 8

Then, perform the addition part:
5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: In mathematics, the order of operations should be always applied. First, any calculations inside parentheses should be done, then any exponents (or radicals), then multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally, addition and subtraction (from left to right).

Looking at the mathematical expression 5 + 2 * 4, there are no parentheses, exponents (or radicals) included.  
  
But there is multiplication and addition. According to the order of operations called BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEDMAS, multiplication comes before addition. 

So, you'll first multiply 2 and 4 to get 8. 

Then, you add the result to 5.
  
Finally, when you add 5 and 8, the result is 13.

Hence,

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: In mathematics, there's a specific rule that we need to follow when it comes to order of operations, called ""BODMAS"" or ""PEMDAS."" Both stand for:

B - Brackets first
O - Orders (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)

AS - Addition, Subtraction (left-to-right)

or

P - Parentheses first
E - Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
MD - Multiplication, Division (left-to-right)
AS - Addition, Subtraction (left-to-right)

This tells us to perform multiplication and division before addition and subtraction.

So in your example: 5+2*4, we should do the multiplication part first, which is 2 times 4.

Multiply 2*4 and we get 8.

So it becomes 5+8. 

Then, do the addition. We get: 

5+8 = 13
