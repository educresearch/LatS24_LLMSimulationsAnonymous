PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, let's simplify the expression inside the parentheses. 
2 + 5 = 7

Now, our expression becomes:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we can perform the multiplication and division from left to right. 
4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Our expression is now:
28 + 12 - 6

Finally, we can do the addition and subtraction from left to right.
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

Therefore, the final answer is 34."

PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In the given expression, there are no parentheses or exponents. So, we move on to multiplication and division.

5 + 3 * 2

Since multiplication comes before addition, we first perform the multiplication.

3 * 2 = 6

Now, we can rewrite the expression with the multiplication performed:

5 + 6

Finally, we perform the addition.

5 + 6 = 11

Therefore, the answer is 11."
