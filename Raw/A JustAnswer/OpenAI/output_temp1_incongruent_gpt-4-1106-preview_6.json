Parentheses first:\n   Inside the parentheses we have (2+5), so we calculate this first:\n   2 + 5 = 7\n\n   We now replace (2+5) with 7 in the expression:\n   4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3\n\n2. Multiplication and Division next, from left to right:\n   We have two multiplication operations here: 4 * 7 and 2 * 3.\n   \n   So, let's do those:\n   4 * 7 = 28\n   2 * 3 = 6\n\n   Now, we replace the multiplications in the expression with these results:\n   28 + 12 - 6\n\n3. Lastly, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right:\n   Start with 28 + 12:\n   28 + 12 = 40\n   \n   Now we subtract 6:\n   40 - 6 = 34\n\nSo, the final answer to the problem is 34.\n\nThe answer is 34."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400", "model": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 400, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in grade 6 learning order of operations for the first time.\n                    Explain your solution to this given Mathematics problem, and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "5+3 * 2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: To solve this math problem, we need to follow the order of operations.
