systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: In the order of operations, you always do multiplication or division before you do addition or subtraction. This is remembered using the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

So in this problem, you should multiply 3 and 2 before you add 5.

3 multiplied by 2 equals 6. 

Then, you add 5 to 6.

Which results in 11.

So, the answer to the problem is 11.

The answer is 11."
