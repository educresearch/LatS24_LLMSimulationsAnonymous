Here's the problem again: 4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3

Now, let's solve it step by step according to PEMDAS.

Step 1 - Parentheses first:
Inside the parentheses, we have (2+5). Let's add those numbers.
2 + 5 = 7

Now our expression looks like this:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Step 2 - Exponents:
There are no exponents in this expression, so we can move on to multiplication and division.

Step 3 - Multiplication and Division (from left to right):
First Multiplication: 4 * 7
4 * 7 = 28

Now our expression is:
28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next Multiplication: 2 * 3
2 * 3 = 6

Now our expression is:
28 + 12 - 6

Step 4 - Addition and Subtraction (from left to right):
First Addition: 28 + 12
28 + 12 = 40

Now our equation is:
40 - 6

Subtraction: 40 - 6
40 - 6 = 34
