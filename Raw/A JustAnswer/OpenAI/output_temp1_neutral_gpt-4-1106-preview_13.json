First, we deal with the parentheses (2+5):\n4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3\n\nInside the parentheses, the sum of 2 and 5 is 7. Now the equation looks like this:\n4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3\n\n2. Second, we do the multiplication operations:\nWe have two multiplication operations: 4 * 7 and 2 * 3.\n\n4 * 7 is 28 and 2 * 3 is 6. Now our equation is looking like:\n28 + 12 - 6\n\n3. Third, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n28 + 12 = 40\nThen we subtract 6 from 40:\n40 - 6 = 34\n\nAnd that gives us our final answer.
