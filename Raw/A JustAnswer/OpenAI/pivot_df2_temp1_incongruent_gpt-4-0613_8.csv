gpt-4-0613,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: According to the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS - Brackets, Indices/Orders, Division and Multiplication [from left to right], Addition and Subtraction [from left to right]), we need to complete the calculation inside the brackets first.

4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3

= 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3    (Add 2 + 5)

Afterwards, multiplication and division are to be performed from left to right:

= 28 + 12 - 2 * 3      (Multiply 4 * 7)

= 28 + 12 - 6          (Multiply 2 * 3)

Lastly, carry out the addition and subtraction from left to right:

= 40 - 6               (Add 28 + 12)

= 34                   (Subtract 40 - 6)

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: In this problem, according to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), which stands for Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders (i.e., powers and square roots, etc.), Multiplication & Division (left-to-right), Addition & Subtraction (left-to-right), you should first perform any calculations inside parentheses.

The expression inside the parentheses is 2 + 5 = 7. 

Then you would do the multiplication:

4 * 7 = 28,
2 * 3 = 6.

Replace the expressions with the results to get:

28 + 12 - 6.

Then proceed with the addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40,
40 - 6 = 34.

So the answer to the expression 4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3 is 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this expression, you must follow the PEMDAS/BODMAS rule. PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). BODMAS stands for Brackets, Orders, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

Start by solving what's inside the parentheses, it means 2+5, which gives you 7. 

Then, you move on to multiplication.
The equation becomes 4 * 7, which equals 28.

Next, you add 12 to the result, so the equation stands as 28 + 12, which equals to 40.

Lastly, subtract 2 * 3 (which is 6) from the result. So, the equation is now 40 - 6.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, let's recall the order of operation which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.

Following this order, I first solve the operation in the parentheses which is 2 + 5. This gives me 7. Now our equation is 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, it's time to do multiplication. So, we have 4 * 7, which is equals to 28 and 2 * 3, which equals to 6. Now, our equation is 28 + 12 - 6.

Last step, we have addition and subtraction from left to right. So, 28 + 12 equals to 40 then, subtracting 6 from 40 gives 34.

The answer is 34."
