E: Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
MD: Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS: Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

For the given problem, there are no parentheses, exponents, division, or subtraction to worry about. You simply have multiplication and addition.

According to the order of operations, you should do the multiplication before the addition. So, first multiply 4 by 3, and then add 2 to the result of that multiplication.

4 * 3 = 12
Next, add 2 to 12.

12 + 2 = 14

Therefore, the final answer is 14.

The answer is 14."

- Parentheses (or brackets)
- Exponents (powers and square roots, etc.)
- Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
- Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

Let's solve the problem step by step using these rules.

1. First, solve the addition inside the parentheses (brackets):
   4*(2+5) becomes 4*7 because (2+5) equals 7.

2. Then, perform the multiplication:
   4*7 equals 28.

3. Next, we move on to the next multiplication:
   -2*3 equals -6 because you multiply 2 by 3 and take the sign into account.

4. Now, all we have left is addition and subtraction, which we do from left to right:
   28 + 12 equals 40.
   And then, 40 - 6 equals 34.

Assembling it all together:

4*(2+5)+12-2*3
= 4*7 + 12 - 2*3 (solving inside the parentheses)
= 28 + 12 - 6 (solving multiplication)
= 40 - 6 (solving addition)
= 34 (solving subtraction)

The answer is 34."

The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us the sequence in which we should solve different parts of a mathematical expression. The acronym often used to remember the order of operations is PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this expression, there are no parentheses, exponents, or division. We do have multiplication and addition. According to the order of operations (PEMDAS), we should do the multiplication before the addition.

So first, we multiply 3 * 2:

3 * 2 = 6

Now we have the result of the multiplication, we can proceed to the addition:

5 + 6 = 11

So the final answer to the expression 5 + 3 * 2 is:

The answer is 11."
