In the given expression, we have the numbers 5, 3, and 2, and the operations of addition and multiplication. 

According to the order of operations, we need to perform the multiplication first. Multiplying 3 and 2 gives us 6.

Now, we have 5 + 6. 

Since addition is the last operation remaining, we can add 5 and 6 together. This gives us a final answer of 11.

Therefore, the answer is 11."
