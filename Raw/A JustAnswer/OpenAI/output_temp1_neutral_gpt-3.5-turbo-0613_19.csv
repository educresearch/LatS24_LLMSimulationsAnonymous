5. Finally, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40, and then 40 - 6 = 34.

Therefore, the answer to the expression 4*(2+5)+12-2*3 is 34.

The answer is 34."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this expression, we need to follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS. 

P stands for parentheses. However, there are no parentheses in this expression, so we move on to the next step.

E stands for exponents. There are no exponents in this expression, so we move on to the next step.

MD stands for multiplication and division. We perform these operations from left to right. 

In this case, we have 3 multiplied by 2. So we multiply 3 and 2 to get 6.

The expression now becomes 5 + 6.

Finally, A stands for addition and S stands for subtraction. We perform these operations from left to right. 

In this case, we have 5 plus 6. So we add 5 and 6 to get 11.

Therefore, the answer is 11."
