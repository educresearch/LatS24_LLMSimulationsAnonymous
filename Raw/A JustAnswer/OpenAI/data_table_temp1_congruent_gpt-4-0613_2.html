      <td>GPT Response: First, you should apply the order of operations, also known as BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEDMAS: Brackets/Orders (exponents, square roots, etc.)/Division/Multiplication/Addition/Subtraction. This means you start with any calculations inside parentheses/brackets, then move on to any exponents, and then do division and multiplication from left to right, and finally do addition and subtraction from left to right.<br><br>In the given problem, you should first solve the operation within the brackets. So, 2 + 5 gives 7.<br><br>Then, multiply the result by 4 (because of the multiplication rule). 4*7 gives 28.<br><br>After that, you subtract the result of 2*3. So, 2*3 is 6.<br><br>So, the equation is now 28 + 12 - 6. <br><br>Now, perform the addition operation to get 28 + 12 equal to 40.<br>Finally, subtract 6 from 40 to get the result.<br><br>The final operation is 40 - 6, which equals 34.<br><br>Therefore, the solution to the problem is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First we start with the first operation in parentheses:<br><br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>The operation becomes:<br><br>4*7 + 12 - 2*3<br><br>Next, we do the multiplication operations:<br><br>4*7 = 28  <br>2*3 = 6<br><br>Replace the multiplication results in the expression:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Then, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br>Then,<br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

So, 2 + 5 equals 7.<br><br>Now, our equation looks like this: 4*7 + 12 - 2*3.<br><br>Next, we do Multiplication and Division from left to right. In this case, we see two multiplication operations: 4*7 and 2*3. <br><br>4 times 7 equals 28 and 2 times 3 equals 6.<br><br>Plug those answers back into your equation. The equation now looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Finally, we do Addition and Subtraction from left to right.
