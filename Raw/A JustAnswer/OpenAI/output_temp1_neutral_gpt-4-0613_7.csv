systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: In order to solve this problem, we first have to remember the order of operations. The operations in math problems are to be done in the following order: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This order is often remembered with the acronym PEMDAS or the phrase ""Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally"". 

This problem given is 5 + 3 * 2.

According to the order of operations, we perform multiplication before addition. So first, we multiply 3 and 2 to get 6. 

So, now our Equation is 5 + 6.

Then, we add 5 and 6 to get 11.

The answer is 11."
