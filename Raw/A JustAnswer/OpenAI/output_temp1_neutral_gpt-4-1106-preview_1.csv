systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this mathematics problem, we need to use the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:

- P for Parentheses
- E for Exponents (we don't have any exponents in this problem)
- MD for Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
- AS for Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Following PEMDAS, we first solve any operations inside parentheses:

4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3
= 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Now, we perform the multiplication:

= 28 + 12 - 6

Next, we solve addition and subtraction from left to right:

= 40 - 6

Finally, we subtract:

= 34

So, the answer is 34."

- Parentheses
- Exponents
- Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
- Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

In the expression you've given (5 + 3 * 2), there are no parentheses or exponents, so the next thing to look for is multiplication or division. 

According to PEMDAS, we do the multiplication before the addition. So first, we multiply 3 by 2:

3 * 2 = 6

Now we're left with the addition:

5 + 6 = 11

So the final answer is 11.

The answer is 11."
