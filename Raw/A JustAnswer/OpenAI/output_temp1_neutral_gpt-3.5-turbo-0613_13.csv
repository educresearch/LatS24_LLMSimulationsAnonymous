28 + 12 = 40

Lastly, we have another multiplication operation. 
2 * 3 = 6

Now, let's perform the remaining subtraction. 
40 - 6 = 34

Therefore, the final answer is 34."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to use the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS. PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In our problem, we do not have parentheses or exponents, so we can move on to the multiplication and division. The problem is 5 + 3 * 2. According to PEMDAS, we need to multiply 3 and 2 first.

3 * 2 = 6

Now, we have the problem 5 + 6. We can now do the addition:

5 + 6 = 11

Therefore, the final answer is 11.

The answer is 11."
