gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, you should follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS or BIDMAS (Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Indices, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction):

1. Calculate operations within parentheses first.
2. Then perform multiplication and division from left to right.
3. Finally, perform addition and subtraction from left to right.

Now let's apply this to the given problem:

4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3

First, solve the parentheses:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, perform the multiplications:

28 + 12 - 6

Now, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:

40 - 6 = 34

So the final answer is:

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Let's solve this step by step, following the order of operations: parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This rule is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.

First, we solve the expression inside the parentheses (2+5):

4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3

= 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Now, we perform the multiplication operations:

= 28 + 12 - 6

Next, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:

= 40 - 6

= 34

The final answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this math problem, we'll use the order of operations, which in mathematics is often abbreviated as PEMDAS:

P: Parentheses first
E: Exponents (i.e. powers and square roots, etc.)
MD: Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS: Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

Following this order, we start with operations inside the parentheses:

1. (2+5) 

We do this addition to get:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we do the multiplication:

2. 4 * 7
3. 2 * 3

So the equation becomes:

28 + 12 - 6

Now we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:

4. 28 + 12 = 40
5. 40 - 6 = 34

Putting it all together, our final answer is:

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Let's solve this math problem by following the order of operations. The order of operations can be remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Here's the problem: 4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3

First, we solve the expression inside the parentheses (2+5):
2 + 5 = 7
