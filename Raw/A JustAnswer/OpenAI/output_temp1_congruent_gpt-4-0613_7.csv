systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: First, we need to follow the order of operations, which can be remembered using the acronym PEMDAS:

P - Parentheses first
E - Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
MD - Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS - Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

The problem 5 + 3*2 involves multiplication and addition. According to the order of operations, we should do the multiplication first before the addition. 

Let's solve 3*2 first, which is equal to 6.

Then, add the result to 5. So, 5 + 6 equals to 11.

The answer is 11."
