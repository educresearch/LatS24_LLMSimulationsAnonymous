One common acronym used to remember the order of operations is PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nAccording to these rules, you need to perform multiplication before you do addition.\n\nHere\u2019s how you would solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. Solve the multiplication part of the equation first.\n   \n   3 * 2 = 6\n\n2. Then, add the result of the multiplication to 5.\n\n   5 + 6 = 11\n\nSo, after following the order of operations, the final answer is:\n\nThe answer is 11."}]}]
