gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematics problem, we need to follow the correct order of operations. The order of operations is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So, we start with the expression:

4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3

We first do the operation inside the parentheses:

(2+5) = 7

Now we replace the sum inside the parentheses with 7:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we perform the multiplications:

4 * 7 = 28
and
2 * 3 = 6

Replace these products in our expression:

28 + 12 - 6

Now, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:

P: Parentheses first
E: Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
MD: Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS: Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

Let's follow these steps with our given problem: 4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3.

Step 1: Solve the expression within the parentheses (P).
4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7

Step 2: There are no exponents to work on (E), so we can skip this step.

Step 3: Now, we do the multiplication (MD). Keep in mind that multiplication does not necessarily come before division; you do whichever comes first as you read from left to right.
4 * 7 = 28
And we also have to multiply the second part:
2 * 3 = 6

So, the expression becomes:
28 + 12 - 6

Step 4: Lastly, we perform addition and subtraction (AS) from left to right.
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

Thus, our final answer becomes:

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Okay, I'm happy to help with your math problem! When solving math equations, it's important to follow the 'order of operations'. The order of operations can be remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Let's solve the problem step by step:

The original problem is:
4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3

1. Parentheses first:
Inside the parentheses, we have 2+5. Let's solve that first:
2 + 5 = 7

Now replace the (2+5) with 7 in the equation:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

2. Next, do the Multiplication:
Following the order of operations, we should multiply before we do addition or subtraction. So let's do both multiplications:

First, 4 * 7 = 28
Next, 2 * 3 = 6

Now, let's replace those in the equation:
28 + 12 - 6

3. Finally, we do the Addition and Subtraction from left to right:
First, 28 + 12 = 40
Then subtract 6 from 40, which gives us 40 - 6 = 34

So after performing all the operations in the correct order, we find that the answer is 34.
