gpt-4-0613,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: According to the order of operations, also known as BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEDMAS which stands for Brackets/Orders/Division and Multiplication (from left to right)/ Addition and Subtraction(from left to right), we do calculations in brackets first, followed by exponentiation (orders), then we process multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally addition and subtraction (from left to right).

Following that,

First, calculate the operation inside the parenthesis (brackets): 2 + 5 = 7.

Then, multiply 4 with the result obtained: 4 * 7 = 28.

Next, multiply 2 * 3 = 6. 

After that, perform addition and subtraction operations: 28 + 12 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, you should apply the order of operations, also known as BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEDMAS: Brackets/Orders (exponents, square roots, etc.)/Division/Multiplication/Addition/Subtraction. This means you start with any calculations inside parentheses/brackets, then move on to any exponents, and then do division and multiplication from left to right, and finally do addition and subtraction from left to right.

In the given problem, you should first solve the operation within the brackets. So, 2 + 5 gives 7.

Then, multiply the result by 4 (because of the multiplication rule). 4*7 gives 28.

After that, you subtract the result of 2*3. So, 2*3 is 6.

So, the equation is now 28 + 12 - 6. 

Now, perform the addition operation to get 28 + 12 equal to 40.
Finally, subtract 6 from 40 to get the result.

The final operation is 40 - 6, which equals 34.

Therefore, the solution to the problem is 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First we start with the first operation in parentheses:

2 + 5 = 7

The operation becomes:

4*7 + 12 - 2*3

Next, we do the multiplication operations:

4*7 = 28  
2*3 = 6

Replace the multiplication results in the expression:

28 + 12 - 6

Then, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40
Then,
40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: The first step we need to take in solving this problem uses the Order of Operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Start with 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3. 

First comes the Parentheses operation: The expression (2 + 5) needs to be solved first because it's within parentheses. So, 2 + 5 equals 7.

Now, our equation looks like this: 4*7 + 12 - 2*3.

Next, we do Multiplication and Division from left to right. In this case, we see two multiplication operations: 4*7 and 2*3. 

4 times 7 equals 28 and 2 times 3 equals 6.

Plug those answers back into your equation. The equation now looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.

Finally, we do Addition and Subtraction from left to right. Add 28 and 12 to get 40, then subtract 6 from 40 to get the final answer.

the answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: This problem uses the order of operations, as indicated by ""PEMDAS/BODMAS"" rule which stands for Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders (i.e. power and square root, etc.), Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction.

Following this rule, you should do the multiplication part first before the addition.

The calculation goes as follows:

Step 1: Multiply 4 and 3 to get 12
Step 2: Then add 2 to 12 which is 14

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, you must first carry out the multiplication before you do the addition. This is following the rule of BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEDMAS that stands for Brackets/Orders or Powers/Exponents, Division/Multiplication (from left to right), Addition/Subtraction (from left to right).

First we apply the order of operations, which is sometimes remembered as BIDMAS or PEMDAS: Brackets/parentheses, Indices/Exponents, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

But in this problem, there are no brackets/parentheses, indices/exponents so we go straight to multiplication and division. 

The multiplication operation comes first. So, we multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. 

Now, the equation is 12 + 2.

The problem doesn't contain Parentheses or Exponents, so we skip those. Then we come to Multiplication and Division. There is a multiplication operation in the problem: 2*4. 

We do this multiplication first: 

2*4 equals 8. 

Replacing that in the problem we get 5 + 8.

The next step in PEMDAS is Addition and Subtraction. There's an addition operation: 5 + 8.

5 + 8 equals 13.
