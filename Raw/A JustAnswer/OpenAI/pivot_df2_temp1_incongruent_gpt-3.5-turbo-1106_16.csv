gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression, we'll use the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction).

First, we solve the expression inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

The expression becomes:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Now we perform the multiplication and subtraction from left to right:
4 * 7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2 = 38
38 - 2 * 3 = 38 - 6 = 32

So, the answer is:
The answer is 32.","GPT Response: To solve the given expression, we need to follow the order of operations: parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).
