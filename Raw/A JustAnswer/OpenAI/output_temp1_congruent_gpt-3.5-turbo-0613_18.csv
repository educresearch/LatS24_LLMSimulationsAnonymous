systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS. 

P - Parentheses: Any operations inside parentheses must be done first. 

Inside the parentheses, we have the expression 2 + 5. This equals 7. 

Now, let's rewrite the expression with the result of the parentheses: 
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we move on to the multiplication and division. 

Multiplication:
Multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. 

Now we have: 
28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Multiplication:
Multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6.

Now we have: 
28 + 12 - 6

Next, we move on to addition and subtraction. 

Addition:
28 + 12 equals 40. 

Now we have: 
40 - 6

Finally, we perform the subtraction: 
40 - 6 equals 34. 

So, the answer is 34."

PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this problem, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we can go straight to multiplication. We have to multiply 3 by 2.

3 * 2 = 6

Now, we have 5 + 6 left to solve. Again, we follow the order of operations and perform addition.

5 + 6 = 11

So, the final answer is 11."
