4*(2+5) + 12 - 2*3
= 4*7 + 12 - 2*3

Now we perform the multiplications in the expression from left to right:
4*7 = 28
2*3 = 6

Now we have:
28 + 12 - 6

Finally, we perform the remaining addition and subtraction from left to right:
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).

Then, we move on to the multiplication and division from left to right:
4 * 7 = 28
12 - 2 = 10

Finally, we add and subtract from left to right:
28 + 10 - 2 * 3

Now, we multiply:
28 + 10 - 6 

And finally, we add and subtract:
38 - 6 

So, the answer is 32.
