In order to solve this, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), addition and subtraction (from left to right). This can be remember as PEMDAS.<br><br>First, solve the operation within the parentheses: (2+5) equals 7.<br><br>The equation now is 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Second, perform the multiplication operations: <br><br>4 * 7 equals 28 and 2 * 3 equals 6.<br><br>Thus, the revised equation is 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Finally, perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right. <br><br>28 + 12 equals 40, and then 40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, you should remember that according to order of operations, we solve anything inside parentheses first.<br><br>Here, we have (2+5) inside the parentheses. So we add 2+5, which equals 7.<br><br>So now, our equation changes to: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next we perform the multiplication operations: <br><br>Multiplying 4*7 gives 28.<br><br>And multiplying 2*3 gives 6.<br><br>So now our equation changes to: 28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Next, we perform the addition operation:<br><br>Adding 28+12 gives 40.<br><br>So now our equation changes to: 40 - 6<br><br>Finally, we perform the subtraction operation:<br><br>Subtracting 6 from 40 gives 34. So, <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we need to perform the operations inside the parenthesis which is (2+5) . This equals 7. <br><br>The equation now becomes: <br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3 <br><br>Next in the order of operations is multiplication, indicated by the symbols *. There are two multiplication operations in the equation. <br>1. 4 * 7, equals 28<br>2. 2 * 3, equals 6   <br>   <br>The equation now becomes:<br>28 + 12 - 6 <br><br>Then, we perform the addition operation of 28 + 12, which equals 40. <br><br>Now, the equation is as follows:<br>40 - 6 <br><br>Finally, we do subtraction operation, which makes the final answer 34.<br><br>So, The answer is 34.</td>
