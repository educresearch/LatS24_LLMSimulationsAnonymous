The order of operations tells us the sequence in which we should perform mathematical operations to correctly solve an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember this sequence:\n- P: Parentheses first\n- E: Exponents (i.e. powers and square roots, etc.)\n- M: Multiplication and D: Division (from left to right)\n- A: Addition and S: Subtraction (from left to right)\n\nUsing PEMDAS, let's solve the problem step by step:\n\nGiven expression: 4*(2+5)+12-2*3\n\nStep 1: Parentheses\nWe first solve the expression in the parentheses (2+5):\n4*(2+5)+12-2*3 = 4*7+12-2*3\n\nStep 2: Multiplication\nNext, we need to do the multiplication before the addition and subtraction:\n4*7+12-2*3 = 28+12-2*3\n\nNow we do the multiplication 2*3:\n28+12-2*3 = 28+12-6\n\nStep 3: Addition and Subtraction\nLastly, we solve the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n28+12-6 = 40-6 = 34\n\nThe answer is 34."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400", "model": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 400, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in grade 6 learning order of operations for the first time.\n                    Explain your solution to this given Mathematics problem, and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "5+3*2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: To solve the math problem 5 + 3 * 2, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations is commonly remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents (or powers), Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). Since there are no parentheses or exponents in this problem, we focus on multiplication before addition.\n\nFirst, we do the multiplication, which is 3 * 2:\n\n3 * 2 = 6\n\nNow we take that result and add it to 5:\n\n5 + 6 = 11\n\nSo the final answer to the problem is 11.\n\nThe answer is 11."}]}]
