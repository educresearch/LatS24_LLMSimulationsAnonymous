systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: First, we must refer to the order of operations, which can be remembered using the acronym PEMDAS:

P - Parentheses first
E - Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
MD - Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS - Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

The problem 5 + 3 * 2 has multiplication and addition. According to the order of operations (PEMDAS), multiplication comes before addition. 

Let's solve the multiplication part first:
3 * 2 = 6.

Then, replace 3 * 2 in the original problem with the result:

5 + 6 = 11.

So, after following the order of operations, we found that 5 + 3 * 2 equals 11.

The answer is 11."
