      <td>GPT Response: First, handle the operations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.<br>So the equation becomes 4*7 + 12 - 2*3.<br><br>Next, handle the multiplication operations: <br>4*7 equals 28 and 2*3 equals 6, <br>so the equation simplifies to 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Finally, handle the addition and subtraction operation: <br>28 + 12 equals 40 and 40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Firstly, solve the innermost parentheses or brackets which is (2 + 5).<br>2 + 5 = 7<br>The revised equation will be 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Secondly, multiply out the 4 * 7 and 2 * 3.<br>4 * 7 = 28<br>2 * 3 = 6<br>So, the equation now gets changed to 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Now solve 28 + 12 - 6.<br>28 + 12 equals to 40 and 40 - 6 equals to 34.<br><br>So the final answer is 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

Here in the equation 4*(2+5) + 12 - 2*3, inside the parentheses we have 2 + 5, which equals to 7. <br><br>So, our equation becomes: 4*7 + 12 - 2*3 <br><br>Next, we carry out multiplication or division from left to right. Therefore, we perform 4*7 first, which gives us 28, <br><br>Our equation becomes: 28 + 12 - 2*3 <br><br>Next operation to perform is to continue with the multiplication of 2*3, which equates to 6<br><br>So, our equation now becomes: 28 + 12 - 6 <br><br>Lastly, we carry out the addition and subtraction from left to right. We add 28 and 12 to get 40. Then subtract 6 from this to get our final answer.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
