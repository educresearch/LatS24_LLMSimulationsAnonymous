gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, we follow the parentheses rule which states that we must deal with expressions inside parentheses and brackets first. Here, we have (2 + 5) which gives 7.

So, the equation becomes: 
4*7 + 12 - 2*3

Second, we follow the multiplication rule (also part of the order of operations along with division) which states we must multiply before we add or subtract. Here, we multiply 4*7 to get 28 and 2*3 to get 6:

This changes our equation to: 
28 + 12 - 6

Finally, we follow the addition and subtraction rule (the last part of the order of operations) which states we must add or subtract (from left to right).
Adding 28 and 12 gives 40. Subtracting 6 from 40 gives 34. 

So, the answer is 34."

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: The first thing that we need to do is obey the order of operations, which is usually remembered by the acronym
PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Looking at the equation 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3, we start with the operation in the parentheses. So we calculate 2 + 5, which equals 7. Then, we substitute 7 for (2 + 5) in our equation, which now reads as: 4*7 + 12 - 2*3.

Our next step is to perform the multiplication operations. So we calculate 4*7 and 2*3, which are 28 and 6 respectively. The equation then reads as: 28 + 12 - 6.

Finally, we apply the last part of the order of operations, which is addition and subtraction from left to right. So, we calculate 28 + 12 and then subtract 6 from the result. The equation is calculated as follows: 

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So, the final answer is 34.
