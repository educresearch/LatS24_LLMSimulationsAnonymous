gpt-4-0613,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, follow the rules of the order of operations, which is commonly known as PEMDAS/BODMAS:

    Parentheses/Brackets
    Exponents/Orders (i.e. Powers and roots, etc.)
    Multiplication & Division (left-to-right)
    Addition & Subtraction (left-to-right).

According to these rules, the problem 4*(2+5)+12-2*3 should be solved as follows:

First solve the expression within the parentheses (2 + 5):

    = 4*7+12-2*3

Next, multiplication is performed from left to right:

    = 28+12-6

Lastly, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:

    = 40-6
    = 34

So, the final answer is 34.","GPT Response: The order of operations in mathematics is defined by the acronym PEMDAS/BODMAS: 
Parentheses/Brackets, 
Exponents/Orders (i.e., powers and square roots, etc.), 
Multiplication & Division (left-to-right), 
Addition & Subtraction (left-to-right).

The given equation is: 4*(2+5)+12-2*3

Step 1: First solve the equation inside the parentheses (2+5).
2 + 5 = 7.

So, the equation becomes: 4*7 + 12 - 2*3

Step 2: Then, perform the multiplication operations. As we have two multiplication operations here, we perform both (4*7 and 2*3).
4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6.

So, the equation now becomes: 28 + 12 - 6

Step 3: Finally, perform the addition and subtraction operations, moving from left to right.
28 + 12 = 40, then 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Ok, let's start solving the problem following the order of operations, which is technically known as PEDMAS/BODMAS. This acronym stands for Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders (i.e., powers and square roots, etc.), Division and Multiplication (left-to-right), Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right).

Let's first perform the operation inside the parentheses:
4*(2+5)+12-2*3
= 4*7+12-2*3

Now, multiplication:
= 28+12-2*3

Perform multiplication again on 2*3:
= 28+12-6

Next, conduct addition:
= 40-6

And finally, subtraction:
= 34

So, the final answer is: 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, it's important to follow the order of operations, which can be remembered by the phrase ""Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally"", or PEMDAS for short. It stands for parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), addition, and subtraction (from left to right).

First, we handle the operation inside parentheses. This means we add the 2 + 5:

2 + 5 = 7

So now our equation looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we handle multiplication operations from left to right: 

4 * 7 = 28

2 * 3 = 6

Now our equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

Then, we handle addition and subtraction operations from left to right. 

28 + 12 = 40

So, we are left with: 40 - 6 

40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: In this problem, we use the order of operations, which is commonly remembered by the acronym PEMDAS - Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Here, we don't have parentheses, exponent, division and subtraction. So we start with the multiplication:

4*3 = 12

Then we proceed with the addition:

12+2 = 14

So, the answer to the problem 4*3+2 is 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: In math, the order of operations is given by the BIDMAS/BODMAS rule. It stands for Brackets, Indices/Orders, Division/Multiplication (from left to right), Addition/Subtraction (from left to right).

According to this rule, multiplication should be performed prior to addition.

So here in the expression 4*3+2, we solve the multiplication part first and then the addition.

Here's how we can do it:

4*3 = 12

Then:
12 + 2 = 14

So, the solution to the given problem 4*3+2 is the number 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: The problem is 4*3+2. One of the main rules in order of operations, commonly remembered by the acronym PEDMAS or BODMAS, is that multiplication and division come before addition and subtraction. That means you need to do 4 times 3 first, and then you add 2.

Here's how it works:
First, you do 4*3, which equals 12.
Then, you take the 12 and add 2, so 12+2 equals 14.

So the final answer to the problem 4*3+2 is 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, you need to remember the order of operations rule, which is often remembered by the abbreviation ""PEMDAS"" or ""BIDMAS"".
