      <td>GPT Response: The order of operations rule in mathematics is often abbreviated as BIDMAS or PEMDAS: Brackets/parentheses, Indices/Exponents, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>So, proceeding with this rule,<br><br>Step 1: Solve what's inside the parentheses, 2 + 5 = 7.<br>        So, the expression now becomes 4*7 + 12 - 2*3.<br><br>Step 2: Perform the multiplication from left to right.<br>        Here, multiplication operations are 4*7 and 2*3.

      <td>GPT Response: Alright. To solve this, you can use 'BIDMAS' rule, which stands for Brackets, Indices, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>Firstly, you solve what's inside the Bracket: 2 + 5, which equals 7.<br><br>Now the equation is 4*7 + 12 - 2*3. <br><br>Secondly, you do multiplication (and remember multiplication and division are done from left to right). So, you'll multiply 4 and 7 which equals 28 then 2 and 3, which equals 6.<br><br>Now your equation is 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Lastly, you perform addition and subtraction (from left to right). When you add 28 and 12 you get 40. And subtracting 6 from 40 gives you 34.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Sure, let's solve this step by step!<br><br>The first rule of the order of operations (BIDMAS or PEMDAS) says we should perform any calculations in Brackets (or Parentheses) first. So let's add 2 and 5 inside the brackets:<br><br>4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3<br>= 4*7 + 12 - 2*3<br><br>The next step in the order of operations is to perform any multiplication or division, from left to right. So first we multiply 4 and 7, and then we multiply 2 and 3:<br><br>= 28 + 12 - 2*3<br>= 28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Finally, we perform any addition or subtraction, from left to right. So first we add 28 and 12, and then we subtract 6:<br><br>= 40 - 6<br>= 34<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
