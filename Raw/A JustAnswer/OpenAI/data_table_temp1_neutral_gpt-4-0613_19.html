      <td>GPT Response: The order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, dictates that operations should be done in the following order: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication & Division (from left to right), Addition & Subtraction (from left to right), <br><br>Applying these rules to the problem:<br><br>4*(2+5)+12-2*3<br><br>First, perform the operation in the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7<br><br>So, the expression becomes:<br><br>4*7+12-2*3<br><br>Next, multiplication: 4*7 = 28 and 2*3 = 6<br><br>So, the expression becomes:<br><br>28+12-6<br><br>To finish, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40, and 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: The first step to solve this problem is to perform the operation inside the brackets (parentheses). According to the BIDMAS/BODMAS rule (Brackets, Indices/Orders, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction), operations enclosed in parentheses are done first.  <br>  <br>So, let's add 2 and 5: <br>   4*(2+5) + 12 - 2*3<br> = 4*7 + 12 - 2*3<br><br>The next step is to do the multiplication. So, we perform the two separate multiplication operations:<br>  = 28 + 12 - 6 <br><br>Now, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:<br>  = 40 - 6<br>  = 34<br><br>So, the solution to the problem is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

We get:<br><br>==> 4*7+12-2*3<br><br>Next, looking at PEMDAS, we perform the multiplication operations. There are two multiplication operations in the problem: 4*7 and 2*3. <br><br>When we do these, we get:<br><br>==> 28+12-6<br><br>Finally, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right, we first add 28 and 12 to get 40; then from 40, we subtract 6:<br><br>==> 40-6 <br><br>This simplifies to 34.<br><br>Therefore,<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
