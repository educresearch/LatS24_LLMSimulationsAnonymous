gpt-4-0613,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: = 4*7+12-6
= 28+12-6
= 40-6
= 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, perform operations in parenthesis: 2+5=7. 

The expression then simplifies to: 4*7+12-2*3. 

We then proceed with multiplication in order of appearance: 4*7=28 and 2*3=6. 

So, we get 28+12-6 =34. 

Therefore, the solution is 34. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Here is the problem: 4*(2+5)+12-2*3

First, let's handle the operation in parentheses (2+5) which is 7:
So, the problem becomes: 4*7+12-2*3

Second, we perform multiplication, so 4*7 is 28 and 2*3 is 6:
Now, the problem looks like: 28+12-6

Lastly, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:
28 + 12 gives us 40. Then, 40 - 6 is 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: The order of operations tells us to perform operations in a certain order to make sure everyone gets the same answer. The order is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This can be remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction.

In the problem, here are the steps I would follow:
- First, I would do the operation inside parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7
- Then, I would do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28
- After that, I would do the subtraction and multiplication from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40 and 2 * 3 = 6
- Finally, I would do the final subtraction: 40 - 6 = 34

So, the answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: In mathematics, operations must be performed in a specific order. This is where 'BIDMAS' or 'PEMDAS' comes in, which stands for Brackets, Indices/Order, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction.
So in this problem, you must do the multiplication first, then the addition.

Step 1: Perform the multiplication operation.
          4*3 = 12

Step 2: Add the result to 2.
          12 + 2 = 14
