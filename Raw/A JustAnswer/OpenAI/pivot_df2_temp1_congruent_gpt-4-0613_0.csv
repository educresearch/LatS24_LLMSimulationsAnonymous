gpt-4-0613,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: The order of operations, also known as BIDMAS or PEMDAS, tells us to perform any calculations inside parentheses first, then exponentiation if it's present in the equation, then multiplication and division from left to right and finally addition and subtraction from left to right.

So step 1: perform calculations inside parentheses: 

2 + 5 equals 7. 

Now the equation is 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. 

Step 2: multiplication operations:

4 * 7 equals 28 and 
2 * 3 equals 6. 

Now the equation is 28 + 12 - 6.

Step 3: Going from left to right, do the operations of addition and subtraction:

28 + 12 equals 40 and 
40 - 6 equals 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Firstly, we perform the operations inside the parentheses, so we have 4*(7) + 12 - 2*3.
Next, we perform multiplication operations according to the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), so 4*7 becomes 28 and 2*3 becomes 6, resulting to 28 + 12 - 6.
Afterwards, we perform the remaining operations from left to right, which results in 34 - 6.
Finally, 34 - 6 equals 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: In this response, I will use the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Step 1: Parentheses (2 + 5)
You first solve for the operation in the parentheses, which is adding 2 and 5. This equals 7.

Step 2: Adjust equation
The equation then becomes 4*7 + 12 - 2*3.

Step 3: Multiplication (4*7 and 2*3)
Next, you perform the multiplication operations, which are multiplying 4 and 7 and also 2 and 3. These equal 28 and 6 respectively.

Step 4: Adjust equation again
The equation then becomes 28 + 12 - 6.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (28 + 12 - 6)
Lastly, you perform the addition and subtraction operations. 

First, add 28 and 12 which equals 40.
Then, subtract 6 from 40 which equals 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we start with the operation inside the parentheses, 2 + 5, which equals to 7.

So the expression becomes: 4*7 + 12 - 2*3

Next, we perform the multiplication operations according to the order of operations. So we have: 4*7 = 28 and 2*3 = 6 

The expression now becomes: 28 + 12 - 6

Finally, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.

So, 28 + 12 = 40 and then 40 - 6 equals to 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: This mathematical operation can be solved by applying the order of operations, known as BIDMAS or PEMDAS:

Parentheses
Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
Multiplication and Division
Addition and Subtraction

Multiplication and division are done from left to right then addition and subtraction are done from left to right.

According to this rule, multiplication comes before addition. So, you first multiply 4 and 3 which equals 12, then add 2.

The calculation then is as follows:

4*3 + 2
= 12 + 2 
= 14

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: In this problem, we'll follow the order of operations defined by BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEDMAS, which states:

1. Brackets/parentheses
2. Indices/Orders/Exponents
3. Division and Multiplication (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

So, the multiplication operation is performed before the addition operation.

The problem 4*3 + 2 becomes firstly:

4*3 = 12

Then adding 2:

12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Let's use the order of operations rules, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for:

- Parentheses

Starting with multiplication and division, before addition and subtraction. 

In this case, you only have multiplication and addition:

4 * 3 + 2  

According to the order of operations, we must perform the multiplication first. That gives us 12.

Then we add the 2. This gives us:

12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: In the given Math problem, we have to do the multiplication before addition response because of BIDMAS or PEDMAS order of operations rules. BIDMAS stands for Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction. PEDMAS stands for Parenthesis, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction. Both Multiplication and Division come before Addition and Subtraction.

So first, we will do 4*3 which equals 12.
