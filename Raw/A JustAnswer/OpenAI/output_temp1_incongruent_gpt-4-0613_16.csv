P – Parentheses first
E – Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)  
MD – Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS – Addition and subtraction (left-to-right)

We've already done P, but there are no operations in E to perform, so we move on to MD. 

So the initial equation 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3, after performing 2+5, becomes 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. 

Now, we perform Multiplication operation: 4 multiplication by 7 equals 28 and 2 multiplication by 3 equals 6. So we substitute those values back into the equation and we now have 28 + 12 - 6.

Finally, we just do the addition and subtraction from left to right; first we add 28 and 12 to get 40. Subtracting 6 from 40 gives us 34.

The answer is 34."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve 5 + 3 * 2, we have to follow the order of operations. The acronym to remember here is ""PEMDAS,"" which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction. 

In our problem, we have multiplication (3 * 2) and addition (5). According to PEMDAS, we need to do multiplication before addition. 

So, we first multiply 3 * 2 which equals 6. 

The new problem now is 5 + 6.

After that, we do the addition and get 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11."
