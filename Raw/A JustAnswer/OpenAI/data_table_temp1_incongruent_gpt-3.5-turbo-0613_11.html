The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us the correct order in which to perform mathematical operations.<br><br>The order of operations is as follows:<br><br>1.

Multiplication and Division: Perform any multiplication or division from left to right.<br>4. Addition and Subtraction: Perform any addition or subtraction from left to right.<br><br>Now let's apply the order of operations to the given problem:<br><br>First, we see that there are parentheses in the expression (2 + 5). Inside the parentheses, we have a simple addition operation, and the answer is 7.<br><br>Next, we have 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. According to the order of operations, we need to perform multiplication before addition or subtraction. So, let's calculate 4 * 7, which equals 28.<br><br>Now we have 28 + 12 - 2 * 3. Multiplying 2 by 3 gives us 6.<br><br>The expression becomes 28 + 12 - 6. Since addition and subtraction have the same level of priority, we perform them from left to right.<br><br>28 + 12 equals 40. <br><br>Finally, 40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
