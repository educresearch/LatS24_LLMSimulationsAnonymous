The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us the order in which we should perform mathematical operations.

In this problem, we have addition and multiplication. According to the order of operations, we need to perform the multiplication first, and then the addition.

So, first, we multiply 3 and 2. 3 * 2 equals 6.

Now, we have 5 + 6.

Finally, we add 5 and 6. 5 + 6 equals 11.

Therefore, the answer is 11."
