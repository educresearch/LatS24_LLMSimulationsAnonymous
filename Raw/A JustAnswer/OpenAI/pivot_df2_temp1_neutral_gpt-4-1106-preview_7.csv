gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Let's simplify the expression step by step using the order of operations, which is parentheses first, then multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally addition and subtraction (from left to right).

The given expression is:
4*(2+5)+12-2*3

First, we solve the operation inside the parentheses:
(2+5) = 7

Now our expression looks like this:
4*7+12-2*3

Next, we perform multiplication:
4*7 = 28
2*3 = 6

Now we have:
28+12-6

Then we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
28+12 = 40

And finally:
40-6 = 34

So the final answer is:
The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Let's solve the expression step by step, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: parentheses/brackets, exponents/orders, multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction):

First, we have to solve the expression inside parentheses: (2+5)

4*(2+5)+12-2*3
= 4*7+12-2*3

Now, perform the multiplication:

- E: Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
- MD: Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
- AS: Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

Now let's solve the problem step by step following the order of operations:

1. Parentheses first:
   4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3

   Calculate the value inside the parentheses:
   2 + 5 = 7

   The expression now becomes:
   4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

2. Multiplication and Division (left-to-right):
   First, do the first multiplication:
   4 * 7 = 28

   Then the second multiplication:
   - 2 * 3 = - 6

   Now the expression is:
   28 + 12 - 6

3. Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right):
   Start with the addition:
   28 + 12 = 40

   Now subtract:
   40 - 6 = 34

So the final answer is:

Given the problem:

4*(2+5)+12-2*3

We'll follow the order of operations to find the solution.

First, we solve the expression within the parentheses (2+5):
2 + 5 = 7

Now the expression looks like this:
4*7 + 12 - 2*3

Next, we do the multiplications:
4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Substitute those back in:
28 + 12 - 6

Now we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:
28 + 12 = 40
And then subtract 6 from 40:
40 - 6 = 34

So after applying the order of operations, we find that:
