P - Parentheses first
E - Exponents (powers and square roots, etc.)
MD - Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS - Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

Following this order:

Firstly, solve the expression within the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

Now, multiply the result by 4:
4 * 7 = 28

Then we have:
28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, do the multiplication before addition and subtraction:
2 * 3 = 6

So the expression now looks like this:
28 + 12 - 6

Now we perform addition and subtraction from left-to-right:
28 + 12 = 40
Then
40 - 6 = 34

Therefore, the final answer is:
The answer is 34."

The order of operations is a set of rules that tells you which calculations to perform first in order to solve a math problem correctly. The rules are often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:

P: Parentheses first
E: Exponents (i.e. powers and square roots, etc.)
MD: Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS: Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

In the expression ""5 + 3*2"", we have addition and multiplication. According to the order of operations, we need to do the multiplication before the addition.

So, let's first multiply 3 by 2:
3 * 2 = 6

Now we add that result to 5:
5 + 6 = 11

Therefore, the answer is 11."
