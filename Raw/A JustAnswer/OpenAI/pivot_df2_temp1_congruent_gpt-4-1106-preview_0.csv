gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: To solve the math problem, we'll use the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Parentheses: Calculate the expression inside the parentheses first.
   2 + 5 = 7

2. Multiplication: Multiply the result within the parentheses by 4.
   4 * 7 = 28

3. Multiplication: Multiply 2 by 3.
   2 * 3 = 6

4. Addition and Subtraction: Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.
   28 + 12 - 6

   First, add 28 and 12.
   28 + 12 = 40

   Then subtract 6 from the result.
   40 - 6 = 34

The final answer is 34, so ""The answer is 34.""","GPT Response: Let's solve the expression step by step using order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction):

Given expression: 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3

Step 1: First, solve the parentheses (Brackets):

2 + 5 = 7

Replace this into the original expression:

4*7 + 12 - 2*3

Step 2: Next, handle the Multiplications:

4*7 = 28
2*3 = 6

Replace these into the expression:

28 + 12 - 6

Step 3: Now we only have Addition and Subtraction left, so we solve from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40

Now substitute 40 back into the expression:

40 - 6

The final step:

40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: In order to solve this mathematical problem, you need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Now, let's solve the problem step-by-step:

1. Start with Parentheses (P)
   You need to do the operations inside the parentheses first.
   \(4*(2 + 5)\) becomes \(4*7\) since \(2+5=7\).

2. Then handle Multiplication and Division (MD)
   Now multiply 4 by 7 and also solve 2*3.
   \(4*7 = 28\)
   \(2*3 = 6\)
   So, now your equation looks like: \(28 + 12 - 6\)

3. Finally, handle Addition and Subtraction (AS)
   Add 28 and 12, then subtract 6 from their sum.
   \(28 + 12 = 40\)
   \(40 - 6 = 34\)

Thus, the final answer is:

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Alright, to solve this problem, we need to use the order of operations which in mathematics can be remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:
- Parentheses
- Exponents
- Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
- Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's solve the problem step by step following this order:

1. Parentheses first:
We must solve the expression inside the parentheses (2 + 5), which equals 7.

Now our expression looks like this:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

2. Multiplication:
Next, we perform the multiplication operations, there are two:
4 * 7 = 28 and
2 * 3 = 6

Now our expression is:
28 + 12 - 6

3. Addition and Subtraction:
Finally, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right.

First, add 28 and 12, which is 40.
Now, our expression is reduced to:
40 - 6

And when we subtract 6 from 40, we get 34.

So the answer to this problem is 34.
