      <td>GPT Response: First, we need to remember the BIDMAS/PEMDAS rule:<br>The sequence for performing operations is Brackets/parentheses, Indices/Exponents, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>First, let's do what's inside the brackets/parentheses:<br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Then substitute that into the original problem:<br>4*7 + 12 - 2*3<br><br>Next, we do the multiplication:<br>4*7 = 28<br>2*3 = 6<br><br>Substitute these results back into the equation:<br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Finally, do the addition and subtraction from left to right:<br>28 + 12 = 40<br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So the result of the given expression is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, you have to use the order of operations, known as BIDMAS or PEMDAS. The order of operations is: <br>- Brackets/parentheses, <br>- Indices/Exponents (powers and square roots, etc.), <br>- Division and Multiplication (left-to-right), <br>- Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right).<br><br>The given expression: 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3, contains parentheses, multiplication, addition and subtraction.<br><br>Let's start applying BIDMAS/PEMDAS:<br><br>In the brackets: 2 + 5 = 7<br>So it becomes 4*7 + 12 - 2*3<br><br>Then do the multiplication: <br>4*7 = 28 and<br>2*3 = 6<br>So it becomes 28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Finally do the addition and subtraction from left to right:<br>28 + 12 = 40<br>And 40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So, 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3 equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: The first step is to handle the operations inside the parentheses using the order of operations rule also commonly known as BIDMAS or BEDMAS or PEMDAS.<br><br>1. Parentheses first: The problem has a pair of parentheses (2 + 5). 7 is the sum of 2 + 5.<br><br>So, our equation now reads: 4*7 + 12 - 2*3<br><br>2. Then Exponents (Powers and Square Roots, etc.), but there are no exponents in this equation, so we skip to the next step.<br><br>3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right): We have two multiplication operations to handle here.<br><br>First multiplication operation is 4*7 which equals 28.<br>Second multiplication operation is 2*3 which equals 6.<br><br>Now, the equation is: 28 + 12 - 6<br><br>4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right): Two operations to handle here.<br><br>First operation is 28 + 12 which equals 40.<br>Second operation is 40 - 6 which equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve the problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which can be remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>First we calculate the expression in parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.<br><br>So the equation now becomes:<br><br>4*7 + 12 - 2*3<br><br>Then we deal with multiplication. Multiply 4 by 7 to get 28 and 2 by 3 to get 6. <br><br>The equation now becomes:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Then we perform Addition and Subtraction from left to right.<br><br>First, we add 28 and 12 = 40<br><br>And then subtract 6 from 40 = 34.<br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
