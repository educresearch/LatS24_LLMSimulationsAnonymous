systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-1106_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

In this problem, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we'll perform the multiplication first, which is 3*2. 

3*2 equals 6. 

Now we can add 5 to the result of the multiplication:
5 + 6 equals 11. 

So, the final answer is:
The answer is 11."
