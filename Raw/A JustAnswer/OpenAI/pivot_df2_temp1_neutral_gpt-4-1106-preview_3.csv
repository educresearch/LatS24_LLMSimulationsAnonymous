gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this mathematical expression, we should follow the order of operations, which is often abbreviated as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).

Here's the expression: 4*(2+5)+12-2*3

First, let's calculate the parentheses part:
2+5 = 7

Now the expression looks like this:
4*7+12-2*3

Next, we handle the multiplication parts:
4*7 = 28
2*3 = 6

Now update the expression with these values:
28+12-6

Now, let's proceed with addition and subtraction from left to right:
28+12 = 40
And then:
40-6 = 34

So the final answer is:
The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this math problem, we'll follow the order of operations, which is commonly known by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Let's solve it step by step:

1. Parentheses first:
4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3
= 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

2. Multiplication and Division next (from left to right):
= 28 + 12 - 6

3. Addition and Subtraction last (from left to right):
= 40 - 6
= 34

The final answer to the equation is ""The answer is 34.""","GPT Response: Alright, let's solve the given problem using the order of operations. The order of operations is commonly remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for:

- Parentheses
- Exponents
- Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
- Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Now, let's solve the expression step-by-step:

Given expression: 4*(2+5)+12-2*3

1. Start with the parentheses: 

First, calculate the sum inside the parentheses (2+5):
4*(2+5) = 4*7

2. Now, we move on to multiplication and division:

We have two multiplications: 4*7 and 2*3. Perform these separately:
4*7 = 28
2*3 = 6

Now, replace these in the expression:
28 + 12 - 6

3. Finally, we perform addition and subtraction:

Add 28 and 12:
28 + 12 = 40

Subtract 6 from the result:
40 - 6 = 34

Putting it all together, we get the final answer:

Let's go through the problem step by step following the order of operations.

The problem is 4*(2+5)+12-2*3.

Step 1: Solve the parentheses (2+5)
4*(7)+12-2*3

Step 2: Do the multiplication
4*7=28
28+12-2*3

Step 3: Continue with multiplication 2*3=6
28+12-6

Step 4: Do the addition (28+12)
40-6

Step 5: Do the subtraction
40-6=34

So, we just did:
4*(2+5) which became 4*7 = 28
28 + 12 which is 40
Finally, 40 - 2*3 which is 40 - 6 = 34
