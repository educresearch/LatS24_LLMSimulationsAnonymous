gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: When simplifying this expression, you need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

The expression you've provided is: 

5 + 2*4

There are no parentheses or exponents to deal with here, so the next step is to handle the multiplication before the addition.

2*4 = 8

Now the expression is:

5 + 8

Finally, we'll do the addition:

5 + 8 = 13

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 13."

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Let's solve the math problem step by step according to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):

1. Parentheses/Brackets first:
   4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3
   = 4*7 + 12 - 2*3   (since 2 + 5 = 7)

2. Next, do the multiplication:
   = 28 + 12 - 6     (since 4*7 = 28 and 2*3 = 6)

3. Finally, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
   = 40 - 6          (since 28 + 12 = 40)
   = 34              (since 40 - 6 = 34)

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Alright, to solve the given mathematical problem, we need to follow the order of operations. In mathematics, the order of operations is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS or BODMAS, which stands for Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Now, let's solve the given problem step by step according to the order of operations:

1. Parentheses/Brackets First:
   We need to solve whatever is inside the parentheses first, so we will calculate (2 + 5).

   4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3
   4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3

2. Multiplication and Division:
   Next, we'll perform the multiplication operations.

   4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3
   28 + 12 - 2 * 3 

   Now, let's perform the multiplication of 2 * 3:
   
   28 + 12 - 6

3. Addition and Subtraction:
   Finally, we'll perform the addition and subtraction, from left to right.

   Add 28 and 12:
   40 - 6

   Then subtract 6 from 40:
   40 - 6 = 34
