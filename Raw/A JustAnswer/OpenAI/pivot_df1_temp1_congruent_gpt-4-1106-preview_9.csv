gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS/BODMAS (Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction). Following this order:

1. Calculate inside the parentheses (2 + 5)
2. Perform the multiplications and divisions from left to right
3. Perform the additions and subtractions from left to right

Applying these steps:

First, calculate inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

Then, multiply by 4:
4 * 7 = 28

Now, move on to the next multiplication and division (from left to right):
2 * 3 = 6

Now perform the addition and subtraction (from left to right):
28 (from the first multiplication) + 12 = 40
40 - 6 (result of second multiplication) = 34

So,
4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3 equals 34.
