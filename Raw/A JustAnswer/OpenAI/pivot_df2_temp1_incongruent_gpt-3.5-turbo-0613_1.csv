gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is typically abbreviated as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction) or BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division and Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction).

We start by solving inside the parentheses first:
2 + 5 = 7

Next, we multiply 4 by the sum inside the parentheses:
4 * 7 = 28

Moving on to the next operation, we have -2 multiplied by 3:
-2 * 3 = -6

Finally, we add 12 to our previous result:
28 + 12 = 40

Therefore, the answer is 40.","GPT Response: To solve this mathematical expression, we will follow the order of operations, which states that we should first perform any calculations inside parentheses, then any exponents, followed by multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right.

Starting with the given expression:

4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3

Inside the parentheses, we have the expression 2 + 5, which equals 7:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we perform the multiplications:

4 * 7 = 28

2 * 3 = 6

Now our expression becomes:

28 + 12 - 6

Finally, we perform the addition and subtraction operations:

28 + 12 = 40

40 - 6 = 34

Therefore, the final answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered using the acronym PEMDAS:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

2. Multiplication and Division: There are two multiplication operations in the expression. Let's perform those calculations next:
   4 * 7 = 28
   2 * 3 = 6

Now we have:
28 + 12 - 6

3. Addition and Subtraction: Finally, we can perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
   28 + 12 = 40
   40 - 6 = 34

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations: parentheses, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Parentheses
Inside the parentheses, we have the expression 2 + 5. This simplifies to 7.
Now our expression becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Step 2: Multiplication and Division
Next, we have two multiplication operations: 4 * 7 and 2 * 3.
4 * 7 equals 28, and 2 * 3 equals 6.
Our expression now becomes: 28 + 12 - 6.

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction
