gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 2*4, you must follow the order of operations, which is denoted by the acronym PEMDAS:

P: Parentheses first
E: Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
MD: Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Let's solve the expression step by step:

1. Perform the operations inside the parenthesis first: \(2 + 5\).
2 + 5 = 7

2. Multiply the result by 4 since it is outside the parenthesis:

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this mathematics problem, we will use the order of operations, which in mathematics is often abbreviated as BIDMAS or PEMDAS.

- BIDMAS stands for Brackets, Indices, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).
- PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Both acronyms help us remember the order in which we should perform operations when solving mathematical expressions.

Let's break down the expression step-by-step following BIDMAS/PEMDAS:

1. Parentheses/Brackets (solve anything inside parentheses first):
   4 * (2 + 5) turns into 4 * 7 because 2 + 5 equals 7.

2. Exponents/Indices (there are none in this expression).

3. Multiplication and Division (solve from left to right):
   Next, we have two multiplication operations to perform:
   4 * 7 equals 28 and 2 * 3 equals 6.

   So now our expression is reduced to 28 + 12 - 6.

4. Addition and Subtraction (solve from left to right):

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: To solve the given mathematical problem, we need to use the order of operations. The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us the sequence in which we should solve different parts of a math problem. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember this order:

P: Parentheses first
E: Exponents (i.e. powers and square roots, etc.)
MD: Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)

Now let's apply this order to the problem 5 + 2*4:

1. Look for Parentheses. There are none.
2. Look for Exponents. There are none.
3. Perform Multiplication and Division from left to right. Here, we have 2 multiplied by 4.
   So we do that part first: 2 * 4 = 8.
4. Perform Addition and Subtraction from left to right. We only have addition left.

According to PEMDAS, we do the operations inside the parentheses first.

So let's break this down step by step:

1. Calculate inside the parentheses (2 + 5):
   4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3
   4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

2. Perform the multiplication:
   We have two multiplication operations, 4 * 7 and 2 * 3.
