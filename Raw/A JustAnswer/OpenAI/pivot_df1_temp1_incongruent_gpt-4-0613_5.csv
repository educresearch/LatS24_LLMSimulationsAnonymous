gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: In mathematics, the order of operations is crucial. This order is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

According to these rules, you should do the multiplication before the addition.

So for this problem, it should be solved like this:

2 * 4 = 8 
5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the rules of the Order of Operations, also known as BIDMAS or PEMDAS:
- Brackets/parentheses 
- Indices/Exponents
- Division and Multiplication (from left to right)
- Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

In this case, we don't have Brackets/Parentheses, Indices/Exponents or Division to worry about. So we will start with the Multiplication first then do the Addition, as per the order of Operations.

So we have:

7 * 2+8 * 5

We multiply 7 by 2 to get 14. 

Then, we multiply 8 by 5 to get 40.

The equation now becomes:

14 + 40

Finally, we add 14 and 40 to get a final answer of 54.

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: In this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, also known as BIDMAS or PEMDAS: Brackets/parentheses, Indices/Exponents, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this problem:
4 * 3 + 2
We first do the multiplication, 4 times 3 gives 12. 

So, we now have: 
12 + 2

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: According to the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS: Brackets, Indices/Orders, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction), first do the operation inside the parentheses, then multiplication and division from left to right, followed by addition and subtraction from left to right.

Start with the operation inside the parentheses:

2 + 5 = 7

So, the expression becomes:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Then do the multiplications:

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Which changes the expression to:

28 + 12 - 6

Then, perform addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."

So for the problem 5 + 3 * 2, we do the multiplication first.

3 * 2 is 6,

Then we add that result to 5,

5 + 6 equals 11.

The answer is 11."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: The solution to this problem involves the principle of operations famously known as BIDMAS or PEMDAS: Brackets, Indices (or Exponents), Division and Multiplication (which both have the same priority), Addition and Subtraction (which both have the same priority).

In this case, the expression is 5 + 2 * 4.

According to the rule of BIDMAS or PEMDAS, multiplication should be performed before addition.
Therefore, you would first multiply 2 by 4 to get 8, then proceed to add this to 5.

That gives 5 + 8, which adds up to 13.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: First, the order of operations in mathematics, also known as BODMAS or PEMDAS, requires you to perform all multiplication and division operations before addition and subtraction. This rule stands for Brackets, Orders, Division and Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction (BODMAS) or Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction (PEMDAS).

Given the expression 7 * 2 + 8 * 5, 
do the multiplication operations first:
7 * 2 = 14,
8 * 5 = 40.

Then, you add the results of those two multiplications: 
14 + 40 = 54.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: To solve this math problem, you have to remember the order of operations. This refers to the order in which calculations should be performed in a mathematical equation. It's often remembered with the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). The multiplication part comes before the addition in this rule.

Here, you have multiplcation and addition operations only. According to PEMDAS, you do multiplication before addition. 

So, first do the multiplication:

7 * 2 = 14.
8 * 5 = 40.

Now replace the multiplication operations with their product: 

14 + 40.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: The Order of Operations is a set of rules mathematicians have agreed to follow to calculate equations or expressions from left to right. The order goes Parentheses (or Brackets), Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). The acronym for this is PEMDAS.

Following these rules, here's how we simplify the expression:

First, we do the operation inside the parentheses (brackets):

4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3

= 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

After dealing with the parentheses, we move onto multiplication and division. Be aware here that there are two multiplication operations â€“ we should process them from left to right.

So let's solve it accordingly:

1. Solve the Parentheses first: 

    We have (2+5) inside parentheses, which equals 7. Replace that in the equation, it becomes 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

2. Then, do the Multiplication and Division from left to right. 

    First multiplication to be done: 4 * 7 = 28. 

    So now, our equation becomes 28 + 12 - 2 * 3. 

    Then, do 2 * 3 = 6. 

    The equation becomes 28 + 12 - 6.

3. Finally, apply Addition and Subtraction from left to right.

    Do the addition: 28 + 12 = 40. 

    After this step, our equation becomes 40 - 6.
