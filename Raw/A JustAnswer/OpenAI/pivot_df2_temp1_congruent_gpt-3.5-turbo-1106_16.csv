gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: To solve the given problem, we can use the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).

First, we solve the addition inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

Then, we multiply 4 by the result we got from the parentheses:
4 * 7 = 28

Next, we perform the multiplication:
2 * 3 = 6

Now, we add the values together:
28 + 12 - 6 = 34

So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this expression, we follow the order of operations: parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).

First, we address the parentheses:
4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3
= 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Then we do the multiplications:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3
= 28 + 12 - 6

Finally, we do the additions and subtractions:
28 + 12 - 6
= 40 - 6
= 34

So, the final answer is
