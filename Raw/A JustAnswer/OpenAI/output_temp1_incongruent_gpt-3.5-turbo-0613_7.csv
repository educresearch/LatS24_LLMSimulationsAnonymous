systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS. 

First, we need to do the operations inside the parentheses. 

Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5 which equals 7. 

Next, we need to do the multiplication and division from left to right. 

We have 4 * 7, which equals 28. 

Then, we have 2 * 3, which equals 6. 

Now, we can do the addition and subtraction from left to right. 

We have 28 + 12, which equals 40. 

Finally, we need to subtract 6 from 40. 

40 - 6 equals 34. 

Therefore, the answer is 34."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to use the order of operations. The order of operations tells us in which order to perform different mathematical operations.

The order of operations is as follows:
1. Parentheses: Solve any operations inside parentheses first.
2. Exponents: Solve any exponents or powers next.
3. Multiplication and Division: Perform any multiplication or division from left to right.
4. Addition and Subtraction: Perform any addition or subtraction from left to right.

Using the order of operations, we start by performing the multiplication operation, which is 3 * 2. 

So, 5 + 3 * 2 becomes 5 + 6.

Now, we can perform the addition operation, which is 5 + 6.

The answer is 11."
