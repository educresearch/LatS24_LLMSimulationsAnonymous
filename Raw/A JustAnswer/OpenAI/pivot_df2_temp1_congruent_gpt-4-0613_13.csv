gpt-4-0613,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, perform the operation inside the parentheses: 2+5 equals 7.

So, the equation becomes 4*7 + 12 - 2*3

Next, perform the multiplication: 4x7 equals 28 and 2x3 equals 6.

So, the equation becomes 28 + 12 - 6

Then, perform the subtraction and addition: 28 + 12 equals 40 and 40 - 6 equals 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we resolve the operations inside the parentheses. From operational order (BIDMAS/PEDMAS: Brackets/parentheses, Indices/Exponents, Division and Multiplication from left to right, Addition and subtraction from left to right), we compute (2+5) first, which equals 7. 
So, this simplified expression becomes:

4*7 + 12 - 2*3.

Next, perform the multiplication operations also following the BIDMAS/PEDMAS. So, we compute 4*7=28, and then 2*3=6. The simplified expression becomes:

28 + 12 - 6.

Then, resolve from left to right the remaining addition and subtraction operations: 28 + 12 = 40, and 40 - 6 equals 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we need to solve the problem within the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.
Then, the equation will look like this: 4*7 + 12 - 2*3.
