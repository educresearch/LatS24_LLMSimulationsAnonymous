1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"1. First, we evaluate the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7

2. Then, we perform the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28

3. Next, we add 12: 28 + 12 = 40

4. Finally, we subtract 2 * 3: 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","1. First, we solve the parentheses:
    4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3
2. Next, we perform the multiplication:
    28 + 12 - 6
3. Then, we perform the addition and subtraction:
    40 - 6
4. Finally, we find the result:
    34

The answer is 34.","1. First, we perform the operations inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

2. Next, we perform the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28

3. Then, we add and subtract from left to right:
28 + 12 - 2 * 3 = 28 + 12 - 6 = 44

The answer is 44.","1. Start with the operations inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

2. Perform the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28

3. Now, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

4. Finally, evaluate the remaining multiplication:
2 * 3 = 6

5. Subtract the result from the previous result:
34 - 6 = 28

The answer is 28."
1,4 * 3+2,"1. We start with the multiplication operation first:
    4 * 3 = 12

2. Then we add 2 to the result of the multiplication:
    12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.","Given the mathematical expression:

4 * 3 + 2

1. Multiplication:
First, we perform the multiplication operation:

4 * 3 = 12

2. Addition:
Next, we add the result of the multiplication to the remaining term:

12 + 2 = 14

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 14.","The answer is: PEMDAS

PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplivn Tipication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction. It is the order of operations used to evaluate mathematical expressions.","1. Multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations, so we perform the multiplication operation first.
2. 4 * 3 = 12
3. Now we have 12 + 2.
4. Addition is the remaining operation, so we add 12 and 2.
5. 12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14."
1,5+2 * 4,"1. Perform the multiplication operation: 2 * 4 = 8.
2. Add the result of the multiplication to 5: 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13.","Given the expression 5 + 2 * 4, we follow the order of operations (PEMDAS): Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

1. Multiplication: 2 * 4 = 8
2. Addition: 5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.

The answer is 13.","1. First, we perform the multiplication operation: 2 * 4 = 8.
2. Then, we add the result to 5: 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13.","First, I will perform the multiplication operation:
2 * 4 = 8

Then, I will add the result to 5:
5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13."
1,5+3 * 2,"1. Multiplication takes precedence over addition, so we evaluate 3 * 2 first:
3 * 2 = 6
2. Now we can add 5 to the result of the multiplication:
5 + 6 = 11
The answer is 11.

The answer is 11.","Given the mathematical expression:

5 + 3 * 2

We follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Multiplication: 3 * 2 = 6

2. Addition: 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.

The answer is 11.","1. Multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations. So, we start by multiplying 3 and 2.
2. 3 * 2 = 6
3. Now, we can add 5 and 6.
4. 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.","1. Multiplication comes before addition. So, I will do 3 * 2 first.
3 * 2 = 6

2. Now, I can do the addition:
5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11."
1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"To evaluate the expression 7 * 2 + 8 * 5, we first perform the multiplication operations:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Then, we add the results of the multiplication operations:

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.

The answer is 54.","Given:
7 * 2 + 8 * 5

1. Multiply 7 by 2:
7 * 2 = 14

2. Multiply 8 by 5:
8 * 5 = 40

3. Add the results of the two multiplications:
14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","1. First, we perform the multiplication operations:
   - 7 * 2 = 14
   - 8 * 5 = 40

2. Then, we perform the addition operation:
   - 14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.

The final answer in the form ""The answer is __."" is:
The answer is 54.","1. First, I will perform the operations inside the parentheses, if there are any. In this case, there are none.
