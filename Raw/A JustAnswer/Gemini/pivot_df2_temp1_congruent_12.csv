1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"1. First, we evaluate the parentheses:
4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3
= 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

2. Next, we perform the multiplication and division operations:
= 28 + 12 - 6

3. Finally, we perform the addition and subtraction operations:
= 38

The answer is 38.","1. Start with the parentheses first:
    4 * (2 + 5) = 4 * 7 = 28

2. Next, perform the multiplication:
    28 + 12 = 40

3. Finally, evaluate the remaining operations:
    40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","1. **First, we need to solve the parentheses first: (2 + 5) = 7**
2. **Then, we can simplify the multiplication: 4*7 = 28**
3. **Next, we can add the constant: 28 + 12 = 40**
4. **Lastly, we can subtract the remaining multiplication: 40 - 2*3 = 40 - 6 = 34**

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 34.","1. Perform the operations inside the parentheses first:

2 + 5 = 7

2 * 3 = 6

2. Then, perform the multiplication and division from left to right:

4 * 7 = 28

3. Lastly, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
