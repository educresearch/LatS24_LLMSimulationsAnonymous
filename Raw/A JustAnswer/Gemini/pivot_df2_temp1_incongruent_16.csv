1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"1. Start with the operations inside the parentheses:
4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28

2. Next, perform the multiplication and division operations:
28 + 12 - 2 * 3 = 28 + 12 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","1. First, we solve the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

4 * 7 = 28

2 * 3 = 6

2. Next, we perform the multiplication and addition:
28 + 12 = 40

40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","1. First, we perform the operations inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

2. Next, we do the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28

3. Then, we add and subtract from left to right:
28 + 12 - 2 * 3
28 + 12 - 6

4. Finally, we evaluate the remaining multiplication:
28 + 12 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","1. Start with the parentheses: 2+5 = 7.
2. Perform the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28.
3. Add 12: 28 + 12 = 40.
4. Perform the multiplication: 2 * 3 = 6.
5. Subtract 6: 40 - 6 = 34.

1,5+2 * 4,"1. Perform the multiplication first: 2 * 4 = 8.
2. Then, add the result to 5: 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13.","Given the mathematical expression:

5 + 2 * 4

**Step 1: Perform the multiplication operation first.**

2 * 4 = 8

**Step 2: Add the result of the multiplication to 5.**

5 + 8 = 13

**The answer is 13.**","1. Perform the multiplication first, from left to right.
2 * 4 = 8.

2. Then, add the remaining numbers.
5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13.","1. First, I'll perform the multiplication operation: 2 * 4 = 8.

2. Then, I'll add the result of the multiplication to 5: 5 + 8 = 13.

Therefore, the answer is 13.

The answer is 13."
1,5+3 * 2,"Given the expression: 5 + 3 * 2

1. Multiplication operation has higher precedence than addition, so we perform it first.

2. 3 * 2 = 6

3. Now the expression becomes 5 + 6

4. Addition is straightforward.

5. 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.","Given: 5 + 3 * 2

1. Multiplication takes precedence over addition, so we perform 3 * 2 first.
2. 3 * 2 = 6.

3. Now, we have 5 + 6.
4. Adding these two numbers, we get 11.

The answer is 11.

Therefore, the final answer is:
The answer is 11.","1. Perform the multiplication operation first: 3 * 2 = 6.
2. Then, add the result of the multiplication to 5: 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11.","1. Perform the multiplication first: 3 * 2 = 6.
