1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3
= 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3
= 28 + 12 - 6
= 40 - 6
= 34
The answer is 34.","Solution:
4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3
= 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3
= 28 + 12 - 6
= 40 - 6
= 34
The answer is 34.","1. First, we need to perform the operations inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

2. Next, we perform the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28

3. Then, we add 12:
28 + 12 = 40

4. Finally, we subtract 2 * 3:
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","1. Start with the parentheses first:
    4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3
    28 + 12 - 2 * 3

2. Next, perform the multiplications:
    28 + 12 - 6 * 3
    28 + 12 - 18

3. Then, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
    40 - 18
    22

The answer is 22."
1,4 * 3+2,"Given the expression:

4 * 3 + 2

First, we perform the multiplication:

1,5+2 * 4,"**Question:** 5 + 2 * 4

**Solution:**
1. First, we evaluate the multiplication operation:
2 * 4 = 8

2. Then, we add the result of the multiplication to 5:
5 + 8 = 13

**Answer:**
The answer is 13.","Solution:
We follow the order of operations and first multiply 2 by 4, which equals 8. Then, we add 5 to 8, which equals 13.
The answer is 13.","1. Multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations.

2. 2 * 4 = 8.

3. 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13.","1. First, we perform the multiplication operation: 2 * 4 = 8.
2. Then, we add the result of the multiplication to 5: 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13."
1,5+3 * 2,"11

Explanation:

1. Multiplication has higher precedence than addition, so we perform the multiplication first.
2. 3 * 2 = 6
3. Now we can perform the addition:
5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.","1. Start with the multiplication operation:
   3 * 2 = 6

2. Then, perform the addition operation:
   5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.","1. Perform the multiplication operation first:
3 * 2 = 6

2. Then, perform the addition operation:
5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.

The answer is 11.","1. Perform the multiplication first: 3 * 2 = 6.
2. Then, perform the addition: 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11."
1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"7 * 2 + 8 * 5
= 14 + 40
= 54
The answer is 54.","Given the expression:

7 * 2 + 8 * 5

1. Multiply 7 by 2:
7 * 2 = 14

2. Multiply 8 by 5:
8 * 5 = 40

3. Add the results from steps 1 and 2:
14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","1. First, we perform the multiplication operations:
   - 7 * 2 = 14
   - 8 * 5 = 40

2. Next, we evaluate the addition operation:
   - 14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.

The answer is 54.","1. Perform the operations inside the parentheses first, if any. In this case, there are no parentheses.
2. Perform multiplication and division from left to right. Starting from the left, we have: 7 * 2 = 14 and 8 * 5 = 40.
3. Perform addition and subtraction from left to right. Starting from the left, we have: 14 + 40 = 54.

The answer is 54."
