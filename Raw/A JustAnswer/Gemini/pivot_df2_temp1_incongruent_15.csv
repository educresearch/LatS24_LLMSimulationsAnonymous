1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"1. Start by performing the operations inside the parentheses:
4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28
2. Next, multiply 4 and 28:
4 * 28 = 112
3. Add 12 to 112:
112 + 12 = 124
4. Finally, subtract 2 multiplied by 3:
124 - 2 * 3 = 124 - 6 = 118
The answer is 118.","1. Start with the parentheses:
    4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28

2. Next, perform the multiplication:
    28 + 12 = 40

3. Then, perform the subtraction:
    40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","1. First, we perform the operations inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

2. Then, we multiply 4 by 7:
4 * 7 = 28

3. Next, we add 12:
28 + 12 = 40

4. Finally, we subtract 2 times 3:
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","1. First, we need to solve the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.
2. Next, we multiply the first two factors: 4 * 7 = 28.
3. Then, we add 12 to the product: 28 + 12 = 40.
4. Finally, we subtract the result of multiplying the last two factors: 2 * 3 = 6.

The answer is 34."
1,4 * 3+2,"4 * 3 + 2
= 12 + 2
= 14

The answer is 14.","1. Perform the multiplication operation: 4 * 3 = 12.
2. Add 2 to the result of the multiplication: 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14.","1. Multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations.
2. So, we first calculate 4 * 3 = 12.
3. Then, we add 2 to 12: 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14.","1. Multiplication and division are performed before addition and subtraction.
2. So, 4 * 3 = 12.
3. Then, 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14."
1,5+2 * 4,"First, we evaluate the multiplication operation:

1,5+3 * 2,"1. First, we perform the multiplication operation: 3 * 2 = 6.
2. Then, we add the result to 5: 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11.","Given the mathematical expression:

5 + 3 * 2

按照乘法的优先级，我们首先计算 3 * 2:

3 * 2 = 6

Now, we can substitute the result back into the expression:

5 + 6

Finally, we perform the addition:

5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.

The answer is 11.","1. Multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations.
2. So, we evaluate 3 * 2 first.
3. 3 * 2 = 6.
4. Now we can add 5 to 6.
5. 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11.","1. First, we evaluate the multiplication operation: 3 * 2 = 6.
2. Next, we add the result of the multiplication to the first number: 5 + 6 = 11.
