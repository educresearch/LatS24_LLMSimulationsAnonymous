First, we evaluate the multiplication operation:

2*4 = 8

Now, we can add the remaining numbers:

5 + 8 = 13

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 13."
1,,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"7*2 + 8*5
= 14 + 40
= 54
The answer is 54."
1,,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,"First, we evaluate the multiplication operation: 4 * 3 = 12. Then, we add the result to 2: 12 + 2 = 14.

1,,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"1. Multiply 7 by 2: 7 * 2 = 14
2. Multiply 8 by 5: 8 * 5 = 40
3. Add the results of the two multiplications: 14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54."
1,,systemPrompt2,4*3 + 2,"Explanation:
1. 4 * 3 = 12 (Multiply 4 and 3)
2. 12 + 2 = 14 (Add 12 and 2)

The answer is 14."
1,,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"1. First, we need to evaluate the parentheses:
4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3
= 4*(7) + 12 - 2*3

2. Next, we perform the multiplication:
= 28 + 12 - 2*3

3. Then, we evaluate the remaining multiplication:
= 28 + 12 - 6

4. Finally, we perform the addition and subtraction:
= 40 - 6

The answer is 34."
1,,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"1. Multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations, so we start with 3*2.
2. 3*2 = 6.
3. Now we have 5 + 6.
4. 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11."
1,,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"1. First, we evaluate the multiplication inside the parentheses: 2 * 4 = 8.
2. Then, we perform the addition: 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13."
1,,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"1. Multiplication comes before addition, so we start with the multiplication operations:

   - 7 * 2 = 14
   - 8 * 5 = 40

2. We then add the results of the multiplication operations:

   - 14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54."
