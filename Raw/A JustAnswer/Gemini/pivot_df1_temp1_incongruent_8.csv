1,,systemPrompt1,5+3 * 2,"Given the expression:

5 + 3 * 2

To evaluate this expression, we follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Perform any operations inside parentheses (there are none in this expression).
2. Evaluate exponents (there are none in this expression).
3. Multiply and divide from left to right.
4. Add and subtract from left to right.

Following this order:

3 * 2 = 6
5 + 6 = 11

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 11."

1,,systemPrompt4,7 * 2+8 * 5,"**Problem:**

Find the derivative of the function $f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 3x + 4$.

**Solution:**

Using the power rule of differentiation, we have:

$f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(x^3 + 2x^2 - 3x + 4)$
$= \frac{d}{dx}x^3 + \frac{d}{dx}2x^2 - \frac{d}{dx}3x + \frac{d}{dx}4$
$= 3x^2 + 4x - 3 + 0$
$= 3x^2 + 4x - 3$
