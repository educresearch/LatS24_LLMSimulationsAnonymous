1,,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"I can solve this simple arithmetic expression step-by-step:

1. Perform the multiplication first: 4 * 3 = 12.
2. Then, add the result to 2: 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14.

The answer is 14."
1,,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"1. Start with the parentheses first:
\(2 + 5 = 7\)

2. Multiply the result by \(4\):
\(4 * 7 = 28\)

3. Add \(12\) to the result:
\(28 + 12 = 40\)

4. Multiply \(2\) and \(3\):
\(2 * 3 = 6\)

5. Subtract the result from \(40\):
\(40 - 6 = 34\)

Therefore, the final answer is:

**The answer is 34.**"
