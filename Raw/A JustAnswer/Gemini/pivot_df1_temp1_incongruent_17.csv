1,,systemPrompt1,5+3 * 2,"**Problem:** 5 + 3 * 2

**Explanation:**
1. Multiplication has precedence over addition, so we evaluate the multiplication first.
2. 3 * 2 = 6.
3. Now we have 5 + 6.
4. 5 + 6 = 11.

**Answer:** The answer is 11."
1,,systemPrompt2,5+2 * 4,"Given the expression:

5 + 2 * 4

We follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Perform any operations inside parentheses (there are none in this expression).
2. Evaluate any exponents (there are none in this expression).
3. Multiply and divide from left to right.
4. Add and subtract from left to right.

So, we have:

5 + 2 * 4

= 5 + 8

= 13

The answer is 13."
1,,systemPrompt2,7 * 2+8 * 5,"```
Solve for x:
x + 3y = 7
2x - y = 1
```

Solution:
```
Solve the second equation for y:
2x - y = 1
y = 2x - 1

Substituting this expression for y into the first equation, we get:
x + 3(2x - 1) = 7
x + 6x - 3 = 7
7x - 3 = 7
7x = 7 + 3
7x = 10
x = 10/7

Thus, the solution is x = 10/7.

The answer is 10/7.
