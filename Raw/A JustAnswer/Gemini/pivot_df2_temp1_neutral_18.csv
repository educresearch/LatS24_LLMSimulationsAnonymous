1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3
= 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3
= 28 + 12 - 6
= 40 - 6
= 34
The answer is 34.","1. First, we evaluate the parentheses:
4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

2. Next, we perform the multiplication:
28 + 12 - 2 * 3

3. Then, we evaluate the remaining multiplication:
28 + 12 - 6

4. Finally, we perform the addition and subtraction:
40 - 6

The answer is 34.","1. First, we need to solve the parentheses: \(2+5 = 7\) and \(2 \times 3 = 6\).
2. Next, we can perform the multiplications: \(4 \times 7 = 28\) and \(12 - 6 = 6\).
3. Finally, we can add and subtract from left to right: \(28 + 6 = 34\).

The answer is 34.","1. **Parentheses first:**
    * 2 + 5 = 7

2. **Multiplication and division (from left to right):**
    * 4 * 7 = 28
    * 2 * 3 = 6

3. **Addition and subtraction (from left to right):**
    * 28 + 12 = 40
    * 40 - 6 = 34

2. Then, add the result to 5: 5 + 8 = 13.

Therefore, the answer is 13.

The answer is 13.","Certainly! I can solve various types of mathematical problems and provide concise explanations. Here's an example:

**Problem:**

Solve for x in the following equation:
```
3x + 5 = 17
```

**Explanation:**

1. Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
```
3x + 5 - 5 = 17 - 5
```
This gives us:
```
3x = 12
```

2. Divide both sides of the equation by 3:
```
3x / 3 = 12 / 3
```
This simplifies to:
```
x = 4
```

**Final Answer:**
```
The answer is 4
```

5+2*4

**Order of Operations:**

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

**Solution:**

1. There are no parentheses or exponents, so we move on to multiplication and division.
2. Starting from left to right, we have 2*4 = 8.
3. Now we have 5+8.
4. Again, starting from left to right, we have 5+8 = 13.
