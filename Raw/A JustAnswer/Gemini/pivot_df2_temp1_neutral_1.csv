1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"1. Start with the parentheses first:
    - 2 + 5 = 7

2. Then, perform the multiplication:
    - 4 * 7 = 28

3. Next, add 12:
    - 28 + 12 = 40

4. Finally, subtract 2 * 3:
    - 2 * 3 = 6
    - 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.

The answer is 34.","1. Start with the operations inside the parentheses:
4 * (2 + 5) = 4 * 7 = 28

2. Next, perform multiplication and division from left to right:
4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3 = 28 + 12 - 2 * 3

3. Then, perform multiplication and division from left to right:
28 + 12 - 2 * 3 = 28 + 12 - 6

4. Finally, perform addition and subtraction from left to right:
28 + 12 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","1. First, we perform the operations inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

2. Next, we multiply 4 by 7:
4 * 7 = 28

3. Then, we add 12 to 28:
28 + 12 = 40

4. After that, we multiply 2 by 3:
2 * 3 = 6

5. Finally, we subtract 6 from 40:
40 - 6 = **34**

The answer is 34.","1. First, we evaluate the parentheses:
4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

2. Next, we perform the multiplication:
28 + 12 - 2 * 3
28 + 12 - 6

3. Then, we perform the addition and subtraction:
40 - 6

The answer is 34."
1,4*3+2,"1. Perform the multiplication first: 4 * 3 = 12.
2. Then add the remaining number: 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14.","I can solve this simple arithmetic expression step-by-step:

1. Perform the multiplication first: 4 * 3 = 12
2. Then, add 2 to the result: 12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.

The answer is 14.",4 x 3 + 2 = 14**14__,"1. Perform the multiplication operation first: 4 * 3 = 12.
2. Then, perform the addition operation: 12 + 2 = 14.

1,5+2*4,"1. Perform the multiplication operation first.
2\*4 = 8

2. Then, perform the addition operation.
5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.","Given:

5 + 2 * 4

Following the order of operations (PEMDAS), we first evaluate the multiplication:

2 * 4 = 8

Now, we add the results:

5 + 8 = 13

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 13.","1. First, we perform the multiplication operation:
   2 * 4 = 8
2. Then, we add 5 to the result of the multiplication:
   5 + 8 = 13
   
The answer is 13.

The answer is 13.","1. Multiplication is performed first, from left to right.

2. 2 * 4 = 8

3. Addition is performed next, also from left to right.

4. 5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13."
1,5+3*2,"First, we need to perform the multiplication operation: 3 * 2 = 6.

Then, we add the result of the multiplication to 5: 5 + 6 = 11.

Therefore, the final answer is 11.

The answer is 11.","Given the expression: 5 + 3 * 2

1. Perform the multiplication operation first:
3 * 2 = 6

2. Then, evaluate the addition operation:
5 + 6 = 11

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 11.","1. Multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations. So, we will do 3 * 2 first.
2. 3 * 2 = 6.
3. Now, we can add 5 to 6.
4. 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11.","First, we perform the operation inside the parentheses: 3 * 2 = 6.
Then, we perform the operations from left to right: 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11."
1,7*2+8*5,"1) 7 * 2 = 14
2) 8 * 5 = 40
3) 14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","I can solve this problem using the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Perform any operations inside parentheses. There are no parentheses in this expression, so we move on to the next step.
2. Evaluate exponents. There are no exponents in this expression, so we move on to the next step.
3. Multiply and divide from left to right. We will start with the multiplication operations:
   - 7 * 2 = 14
   - 8 * 5 = 40
4. Add and subtract from left to right. We will add the two products:
   - 14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","1. First, we perform the multiplication operations:
7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

2. Then, we add the results:
