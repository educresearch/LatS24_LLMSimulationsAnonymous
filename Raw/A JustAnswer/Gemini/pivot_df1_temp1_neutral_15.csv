1,,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"I can solve this problem using the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Perform any operations inside parentheses first.
2. Exponents (powers and roots) are evaluated next.
3. Then, multiplication and division are performed from left to right.
4. Finally, addition and subtraction are performed from left to right.

In this case, we only have multiplication and addition, so we perform them in order from left to right:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40
14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.

The answer is 13."
1,,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"Since you did not provide a specific math problem for me to solve, I cannot provide a tailored explanation and answer. However, I can provide you with a general explanation of the order of operations for basic arithmetic operations:

1. **Parenthesis**: First, perform any operations inside the parenthesis.
2. **Exponents**: Next, calculate any exponential or root operations.
3. **Multiplication and Division**: Perform multiplication and division operations from left to right.
4. **Addition and Subtraction**: Lastly, perform addition and subtraction operations from left to right.

If multiple operations of the same precedence occur together, they are performed from left to right.

For example:

```
3 + 4 * 5 - 6
```

1. **Multiplication**: 4 * 5 = 20
2. **Addition and Subtraction**: 3 + 20 - 6 = 17

**The answer is 17.**
