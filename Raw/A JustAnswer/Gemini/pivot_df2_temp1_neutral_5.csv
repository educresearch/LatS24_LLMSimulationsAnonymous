1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"1. Start with the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.
2. Multiplication distributes over addition, so 4 * 7 = 28.
3. Addition and Subtraction are done left to right, so 28 + 12 - 2 * 3 can be further simplified.
4. Multiplication is done before addition and/or Subtraction, so 2 * 3 = 6.
5. Finally, we can calculate 28 + 12 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34.","1. Start with the parentheses first: (2 + 5) = 7.
2. Next, perform the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28.
3. Then, add 12: 28 + 12 = 40.
4. Finally, subtract 2 * 3: 40 - (2 * 3) = 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34.","The given expression is:

```
(666) + 666666
```

To solve this, we follow the order of operations, which is:

1. **Parenthesis**
2. **Exponents/Radical**
3. **Multiplication/Division**
4. **Addition/Subtraction**

Since there are no parenthesis, exponents, or multiplication/ division, we move directly to addition/ subtraction.

```
666 + 666666
= 673332
```

**The answer is 673332.**","1. **Parentheses first:**

   - 2 + 5 = 7

2. **Multiplication and Division (from left to right):**

   - 4 * 7 = 28

3. **Addition and Subtraction (from left to right):**

   - 28 + 12 = 40
   - 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

**The answer is 34.**"
1,4*3+2,"Given the expression 4*3+2:

1. Perform the multiplication first:
    4 * 3 = 12

2. Then, perform the addition:
    12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","We start with the multiplication operation, which has a higher precedence than addition.

4 * 3 = 12

Now we add 2 to the result of the multiplication:

12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","1. Multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations.

2. So, we first evaluate 4 * 3, which equals 12.

3. Then, we add 2 to 12, which equals 14.
