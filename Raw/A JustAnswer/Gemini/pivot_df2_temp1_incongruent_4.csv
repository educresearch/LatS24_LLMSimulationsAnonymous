1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3
= 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3
= 28 + 12 - 6
= 40 - 6
= 34
The answer is 34.","**Problem:** 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3

**Solution:**

1. First, evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:

2+5 = 7

2. Next, perform the multiplication:

4 * 7 = 28

3. Then, perform the addition:

28 + 12 = 40

4. Finally, perform the subtraction and multiplication:

40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

**Answer:** 34","1. First, we need to solve the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.
2. Next, we multiply 4 by 7: 4 * 7 = 28.
3. Then, we add 12 to 28: 28 + 12 = 40.
4. Finally, we subtract 2 * 3 from 40: 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34.","1. First, we perform the operations inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

2. Next, we multiply the result of the parentheses by 4:
4 * 7 = 28

3. Then, we add 12 to the result of the previous step:
28 + 12 = 40

4. Finally, we subtract the product of 2 and 3 from the result of the previous step:
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."

1,5+2 * 4,"Using the order of operations, I will first evaluate the multiplication operation:
5 + 2 * 4
= 5 + 8
= 13
The answer is 13.","Given the expression:

5 + 2 * 4

We follow the order of operations (parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division from left to right, and addition and subtraction from left to right).

1. Perform multiplication first:

2 * 4 = 8

2. Then, add the result to 5:

5 + 8 = 13

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 13.","**Given problem:** 5 + 2 * 4

**Order of operations:**

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

**Solution:**

1. There are no parentheses or exponents in this problem, so we move to the next step.
2. There is one multiplication and one addition operation. We perform the multiplication first, from left to right.
3. 2 * 4 = 8
4. Now we have 5 + 8. We perform the addition from left to right.
5. 5 + 8 = 13

**The answer is 13.**","1. Multiplication comes before addition.
2. 2 * 4 = 8
3. 5 + 8 = 13
The answer is 13."
