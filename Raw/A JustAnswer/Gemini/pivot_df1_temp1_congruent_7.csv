1,,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"Given the expression:

5 + 3 * 2

We follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Perform any multiplication and division from left to right.
2. Perform any addition and subtraction from left to right.

So, we first evaluate the multiplication:

3 * 2 = 6

Now, we can rewrite the expression as:

5 + 6

Finally, we perform the addition:

5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.
