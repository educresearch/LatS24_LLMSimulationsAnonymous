1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"1. Start with the parentheses:
    * 2 + 5 = 7

2. Multiply the result by 4:
    * 4 * 7 = 28

3. Add 12:
    * 28 + 12 = 40

4. Multiply 2 and 3:
    * 2 * 3 = 6

5. Subtract the result from 40:
    * 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","1. First, we evaluate the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

2. Next, we perform the multiplication of the first two terms:
4 * 7 = 28

3. Then, we add 12:
28 + 12 = 40

4. Finally, we perform the multiplication of the last two terms and subtract:
2 * 3 = 6
40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","1. Perform the operations inside the parentheses first.
2+5 = 7

2. Multiply 4 by 7.
4 * 7 = 28

3. Add 12 to 28.
28 + 12 = 40

4. Multiply 2 by 3.
2 * 3 = 6

5. Subtract 6 from 40.
40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","1. First, we need to perform the operations inside the parentheses:
4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28

2. Next, we multiply 4 by 28:
28 + 12 = 40

3. Then, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3:
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
1,4 * 3+2,"I can solve this simple math problem step-by-step:

1. Perform the multiplication first: 4 * 3 = 12
2. Then add 2 to the result of the multiplication: 12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.

The answer is 14.",3*=3+2=3eds‹É,"1. Perform the multiplication operation first: 4 * 3 = 12.
2. Then, perform the addition operation: 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14.","1. Multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations. So, I will start by evaluating the multiplication operation: 4 * 3 = 12.

2. Now, I will add the result of the multiplication to 2: 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14.

The answer is 14."
1,5+2 * 4,"Using the order of operations, we first perform the multiplication operation. 2 * 4 = 8. Then, we add 5 to this result: 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13.","Given the expression:

5 + 2 * 4

We follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Perform any operations inside parentheses. (There are no parentheses in this expression, so we move to the next step.)

2. Evaluate exponents. (There are no exponents in this expression, so we move to the next step.)

3. Perform multiplication and division from left to right.

2 * 4 = 8

4. Perform addition and subtraction from left to right.

5 + 8 = 13

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 13.","1. First, we perform the multiplication operation: 2 * 4 = 8.
2. Then, we add the result to 5: 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13.","1. First, I will perform the multiplication operation: 2 * 4 = 8.
2. Then, I will add the result of the multiplication to 5: 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13."
1,5+3 * 2,"1. First, we need to evaluate the multiplication operation within the parentheses: 3 * 2 = 6.
2. Now, we can perform the addition operation: 5 + 6 = 11.
The answer is 11.","Given the expression:

5 + 3 * 2

1. Perform the multiplication operation first:

3 * 2 = 6

2. Now, substitute the result back into the expression:

5 + 6

3. Perform the addition operation:

5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.

The answer is 11.","1. First, we need to perform the multiplication operation: 3 * 2 = 6.
2. Then, we add the result of the multiplication to 5: 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11.","1. Multiplication comes before addition, so we calculate 3 * 2 first.
2. 3 * 2 = 6.
3. Now we have 5 + 6.
4. Addition is performed from left to right, so we add 5 and 6.
5. 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11."
1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"First, we perform the multiplication operations:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Then, we add the results:

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.

The answer is 54.","1. Multiply 7 by 2: 7 * 2 = 14.
2. Multiply 8 by 5: 8 * 5 = 40.
3. Add the results from steps 1 and 2: 14 + 40 = 54.

The answer is 54.","1. First, we need to perform the multiplication operations:
   - 7 * 2 = 14
   - 8 * 5 = 40

2. Then, we perform the addition operation:
   - 14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","1. Multiplication has precedence over addition, so we start by evaluating the multiplication operations:
   - 7 * 2 = 14
   - 8 * 5 = 40

2. Now we can perform the addition:
   - 14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54."
