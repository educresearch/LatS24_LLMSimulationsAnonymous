**Problem:**

Solve for x in the following equation:
```
3x + 5 = 17
```

**Explanation:**

1. Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
```
3x + 5 - 5 = 17 - 5
```
This gives us:
```
3x = 12
```

2. Divide both sides of the equation by 3:
```
3x / 3 = 12 / 3
```
This simplifies to:
```
x = 4
```

**Final Answer:**
```
The answer is 4
