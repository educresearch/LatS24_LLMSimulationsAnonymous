1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"1. First, we evaluate the parentheses:
4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

2. Next, we perform the multiplication:
28 + 12 - 2 * 3

3. Then, we evaluate the remaining multiplication:
28 + 12 - 6

4. Finally, we perform the addition and subtraction:
28 + 6
34

The answer is 34.","1. First, we evaluate the parentheses:
4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3
= 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3
2. Next, we perform the multiplication:
28 + 12 - 6
3. Then, we perform the addition and subtraction:
40 - 6
4. Finally, we get the result:
34
The answer is 34.","1. First, we perform the operations inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

2. Next, we perform the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28

3. Then, we perform the subtraction and addition from left to right:
28 + 12 - 2 * 3
28 + 12 - 6
40 - 6

4. Finally, we perform the remaining subtraction:
40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","1. Perform the operations inside the parentheses first:
   - 2 + 5 = 7

2. Multiply by the numbers outside the parentheses:
   - 4 * 7 = 28

3. Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
   - 28 + 12 = 40
   - 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
1,4*3 + 2,"1. First, we perform the multiplication operation: 4 * 3 = 12.
2. Then, we add 2 to the result of the multiplication: 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14.","**Problem:** 4*3 + 2

**Solution:**

1. Perform the multiplication operation: 4*3 = 12.

2. Add 2 to the result of the multiplication: 12 + 2 = 14.

**Answer:**

The answer is 14.","1. Perform multiplication first: 4 * 3 = 12
2. Perform addition next: 12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.","1. Multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations, so we start with 4*3, which equals 12.
2. Then, we add 2 to 12, which equals 14.

The answer is 14."
1,5 + 2*4,"First, we evaluate the multiplication inside the parentheses:
2 * 4 = 8

Then, we add 5 to the result of the multiplication:
5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.

The answer is 13.","Given the mathematical expression:

5 + 2 * 4

1. We follow the order of operations (PEMDAS): Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and then Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

2. First, we evaluate the multiplication:
   2 * 4 = 8

3. Now, we have:
   5 + 8

4. Finally, we perform the addition:
   5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.","1. Multiplication has precedence over addition, so we start with the multiplication first:
2. 2 * 4 = 8
3. Then, we add 5 to the result of the multiplication:
5 + 8 = 13
The answer is 13.","The answer is 6.

Explanation:

1. Multiplication and division are performed from left to right, so 6 + 2 x 3 = 6 + 6 = 12.
2. No further operations are possible, so the final answer is 12.

The answer is 12."
1,5 + 3*2,"1. First, we need to perform the multiplication operation before the addition.
2. 3*2 = 6

3. Now, we can add the remaining numbers: 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.","Given the mathematical expression:

5 + 3 * 2

We follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses, so we move on to the next operation.

2. Exponents: There are no exponents, so we move on to the next operation.

3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right):

   - 3 * 2 = 6

4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right):

   - 5 + 6 = 11

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 11.","1. Multiplication operation has higher precedence than addition, so we need to do 3*2 first.
2. 3*2 = 6.
3. Now we have 5 + 6.
4. Addition operation is done from left to right, so we simply add 5 and 6.
5. 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11.","1. First, we perform the multiplication operation: 3*2 = 6.
2. Next, we add 5 to the result of the multiplication: 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11."
1,7*2 + 8*5,"7 * 2 + 8 * 5

= 14 + 40

= 54

The answer is 54.","I can solve this problem using the order of operations, which is PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction).

1. Multiplication: Perform the multiplication operations first.
   - 7 * 2 = 14
   - 8 * 5 = 40

2. Addition: Then, perform the addition operations.
   - 14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.

The answer is 54.","1. First, we need to perform the multiplication operations:
   - 7 * 2 = 14
   - 8 * 5 = 40

2. Then, we add the results of the multiplication operations:
   - 14 + 40 = 54

Therefore, the answer is:
The answer is 54.","1. Perform the operations inside the parentheses first. There are no parentheses in this expression, so we move on to the next step.
2. Perform multiplication and division from left to right.
   - 7 * 2 = 14
   - 8 * 5 = 40
3. Perform addition and subtraction from left to right.
   - 14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54."
