1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3

First, we solve the parentheses:

4*(7) + 12 - 2*3

Next, we perform the multiplication:

28 + 12 - 6

Then, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:

40 - 6

Finally, we get the answer:

The answer is 34.","1. Start with the order of operations (PEMDAS): parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).
2. First, evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.
3. Then, perform the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28.
4. Next, add 12: 28 + 12 = 40.
5. Finally, subtract 2 * 3: 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34.","1. First, we **perform the operations inside the parentheses**:

    4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3
    = 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

2. Next, we **multiply and divide from left to right**:

    4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3
    = 28 + 12 - 6

3. Finally, we **add and subtract from left to right**:

    28 + 12 - 6
    = 40 - 6

The answer is 34.

The answer is 34.","1. First, we perform the operations inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

2. Next, we perform the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28

3. Then, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
28 + 12 - 2 * 3 = 28 + 12 - 6

4. Finally, we evaluate the remaining multiplication:
28 + 12 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
1,4*3 + 2,"1. Multiply 4 and 3: 4 * 3 = 12
2. Add 2 to the result: 12 + 2 = 14

2. Add 2 to the result.
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.",4*3\ 2,"1. Perform the multiplication first: 4 * 3 = 12.
2. Then, add the result to 2: 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14."
1,5 + 2*4,"We can evaluate the expression by following the order of operations. First, we calculate 2*4 = 8. Then, we add 5 to 8 to get the final result.

5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.","Given the expression 5 + 2*4:

1. Perform the multiplication operation first, following the order of operations (PEMDAS):
2 * 4 = 8

2. Substitute the result back into the expression:
5 + 8

3. Perform the addition operation:
5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.

**The answer is 13.**","1. Perform the multiplication operation first: 2 * 4 = 8.
2. Then, perform the addition operation: 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13.","1. First, we evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 2*4 = 8.
2. Then, we perform the addition: 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13."
1,5 + 3*2,"1. Start with the multiplication operation first: 3*2 = 6
2. Then add 5 to the result of the multiplication: 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.","Given the expression:

5 + 3 * 2

1. Multiplication has precedence over addition:

5 + (3 * 2)

2. Perform the multiplication within the parentheses:

5 + 6

3. Perform the addition:

11

The answer is 11.","1. First, we perform the multiplication operation: 3 * 2 = 6.
2. Then, we add the result of the multiplication to 5: 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11.","1. First, we perform the multiplication operation: 3 * 2 = 6.
2. Then, we add the result of the multiplication to 5: 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11."
1,7*2 + 8*5,"7 * 2 + 8 * 5 = 14 + 40 = 54
The answer is 54.","7 * 2 + 8 * 5
= 14 + 40
= 54
The answer is 54.","1. Multiplication and division are evaluated before addition and subtraction.
2. In this problem, there are two multiplication operations and one addition operation.
3. First, we evaluate the multiplication operations:
   - 7 * 2 = 14
   - 8 * 5 = 40
4. Then, we add the results of the multiplication operations:
   - 14 + 40 = 54
5. Therefore, the answer is 54.

The answer is 54.","1. Perform the operations inside the parentheses first. There are no parentheses in this expression, so we move to the next step.

2. Evaluate exponents. There are no exponents in this expression, so we move to the next step.

3. Multiply and divide from left to right.

   - 7 * 2 = 14
   - 8 * 5 = 40

4. Add and subtract from left to right.

   - 14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54."
