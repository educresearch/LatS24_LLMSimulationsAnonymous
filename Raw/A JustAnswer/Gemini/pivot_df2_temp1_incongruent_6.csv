1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"1. Start with the parentheses: 2+5 = 7.
2. Multiply 4 by 7: 4 * 7 = 28.
3. Add 12 to 28: 28 + 12 = 40.
4. Multiply 2 by 3: 2 * 3 = 6.
5. Subtract 6 from 40: 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34.","Given:
4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3

Step 1: Perform the operations inside the parentheses first.
4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3

Step 2: Multiplication and Division (from left to right).
28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Step 3: Multiplication and Division (from left to right).
28 + 12 - 6

Step 4: Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).
40 - 6

Step 5: Final Subtraction.
34

The answer is 34.","1. First, we solve the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

2. Next, we perform the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28

3. Then, we add and subtract:
28 + 12 - 2 * 3 = 28 + 12 - 6 = 34

4. Finally, we evaluate the remaining multiplication:
34 - 6 = 28

The answer is 28.","1. Perform the operations inside the parentheses first:
2 + 5 = 7

2. Multiply 4 by 7:
4 * 7 = 28

3. Add 12 to 28:
28 + 12 = 40

4. Multiply 2 by 3:
2 * 3 = 6

5. Subtract 6 from 40:
40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
1,4 * 3+2,"Given the expression:

4 * 3 + 2

Following the order of operations (PEMDAS), we first perform multiplication before addition:

4 * 3 = 12

Now, we add the result to 2:

12 + 2 = 14

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 14.","1. Start with the multiplication operation: 4 * 3 = 12.
2. Then, perform the addition operation: 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14.","1. First, we perform the multiplication operation: 4 * 3 = 12.

2. Then, we perform the addition operation: 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14.","1. Multiplication and division are performed before addition and subtraction. In this case, there is only multiplication and addition.
2. Starting from the left, we have 4 * 3. We multiply 4 and 3 to get 12.
3. Next, we have 12 + 2. We add 12 and 2 to get 14.

The answer is 14."
1,5+2 * 4,"1. First, we evaluate the multiplication operation: 2 * 4 = 8.
2. Then, we add the result to 5: 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13.","Given the expression 5 + 2 * 4:

1. Perform the multiplication operation first: 2 * 4 = 8.

2. Then, evaluate the addition operation: 5 + 8 = 13.

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 13.","1. First, we perform the multiplication operation: 2 * 4 = 8.
2. Then, we add the result to 5: 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13.","1. First, we perform the multiplication operation: 2 * 4 = 8.
2. Next, we add the result of the multiplication to 5: 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13."
1,5+3 * 2,"1. Multiply 3 and 2 first.
2. Then add 5 to the result.

5 + 3 * 2
= 5 + 6
= 11

The answer is 11.","Given the mathematical expression:

5 + 3 * 2

Let's follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Multiplication:

3 * 2 = 6

2. Addition:

5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.

The answer is 11.","1. Multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations.
2. So, 3 * 2 = 6.
3. Then, 5 + 6 = 11.
