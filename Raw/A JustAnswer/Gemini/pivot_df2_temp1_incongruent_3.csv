1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3

= 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

= 28 + 12 - 6

= 40 - 6

= 34

The answer is 34.","1. Start with the parentheses:
4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28

2. Perform the multiplication:
28 + 12 - 2 * 3 = 28 + 12 - 6

3. Multiply and then subtract:
28 + 12 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","1. Start with the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

2. Multiplication comes next:
4 * 7 = 28

3. Moving on to addition:
28 + 12 = 40

4. Now, subtraction:
40 - 2 = 38

5. Lastly, multiplication:
2 * 3 = 6

6. Perform the final subtraction:
38 - 6 = 32

The answer is 32.","1. First, we perform the operations inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

2. Then, we perform the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28

3. Next, we perform the addition:
28 + 12 = 40

4. Finally, we perform the subtraction and multiplication from left to right:
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."

1,5+3 * 2,"1. First, we need to perform the multiplication operation: 3 * 2 = 6.
2. Then, we add the result of the multiplication to 5: 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11.","Given the mathematical expression:

5 + 3 * 2

1. Multiplication has precedence over addition, so we evaluate the multiplication first:

3 * 2 = 6

2. Now we have:

5 + 6

3. Perform the addition:

5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.

The answer is 11.","1. Multiplication operation has higher precedence than addition, so we do 3 * 2 first.
2. 3 * 2 = 6.
3. Then we perform the addition: 5 + 6.
4. 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11.","1. **Multiplication first:**
    * 3 * 2 = 6

2. **Addition:**
