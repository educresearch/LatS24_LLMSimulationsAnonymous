1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"1. First, we evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7
2 * 3 = 6

2. Next, we perform the multiplication and addition operations:
4 * 7 = 28
12 - 6 = 6

3. Finally, we add the remaining numbers:
28 + 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","1. 4 * (2 + 5) = 4 * 7 = 28
2. 28 + 12 = 40
3. 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","1. First, we perform the operations inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

2. Next, we multiply 4 by 7:
4 * 7 = 28

3. Then, we add 12 to 28:
28 + 12 = 40

4. Finally, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3 from 40:
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","1. First, we perform the operations inside the parentheses:

2 + 5 = 7

2 * 3 = 6

2. Next, we perform the multiplication:

4 * 7 = 28

3. Then, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
1,4*3+2,"Given the mathematical expression:

4 * 3 + 2

Let's solve it step by step:

1. Perform the multiplication first:
4 * 3 = 12

2. Then, add the result to 2:
12 + 2 = 14

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 14.","First, we perform the multiplication operation:

4 * 3 = 12

Then, we add the result to 2:

12 + 2 = 14

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 14.","The order of operations dictates that we first perform any multiplications, then additions.

4*3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.","1. Perform the multiplication operation first: 4 * 3 = 12.
2. Then, add the result to 2: 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14."
1,5+2*4,"First, we perform the multiplication operation:
2 * 4 = 8
Then, we add the result of the multiplication to 5:

The answer is 13.

The answer is 13.","1. First, we perform the multiplication operation: 2 * 4 = 8.
2. Then, we add 5 to the result: 5 + 8 = 13.

Therefore, the answer is 13.

The answer is 13.","1. Perform the multiplication first: 2 * 4 = 8.
2. Then, add the result to 5: 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13."
1,5+3*2,"1. Perform the multiplication first: 3 * 2 = 6.
2. Then add the result to 5: 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11.","The expression 5 + 3 * 2 can be evaluated using the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction).

1. Multiplication: We perform the multiplication operation first. 3 * 2 = 6.

2. Addition: Next, we perform the addition operation. 5 + 6 = 11.

Therefore, the final answer is 11.

The answer is 11.","**Problem:** 5 + 3 * 2

**Explanation:** 
1. Multiplication has a higher precedence than addition, so we perform the multiplication first.
2. 3 * 2 = 6

**Solution:**
5 + 6 = 11

**Answer:** The answer is 11.","1. Perform multiplication first: 3 * 2 = 6.
2. Then, perform addition: 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11."
1,7*2+8*5,"First, I will multiply 7 by 2 and 8 by 5 separately:
7 * 2 = 14
