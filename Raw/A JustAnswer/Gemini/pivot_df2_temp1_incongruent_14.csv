1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"1. First, we evaluate the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

2. Next, we perform the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28

3. Then, we add 12:
28 + 12 = 40

4. Finally, we subtract 2 * 3:
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","1. First, we perform the operations inside the parentheses:
   4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28

2. Next, we perform the multiplication and division operations:
   28 + 12 - 2 * 3 = 28 + 12 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","1. First, we perform the operations inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

2. Next, we perform multiplication and division from left to right:
4 * 7 = 28

3. Then, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right:
28 + 12 - 2 * 3 = 28 + 12 - 6

4. Finally, we finish the remaining operations:
28 + 12 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","1. Perform the operations inside the parentheses first:
2 + 5 = 7

2. Multiply 4 by 7:
4 * 7 = 28

3. Perform the multiplication and division from left to right:
2 * 3 = 6
12 - 6 = 6

4. Add and subtract from left to right:
28 + 6 = 34
34 - 6 = 28

The answer is 28."
1,4 * 3+2,"Given the expression: 4 * 3 + 2

1. Perform the multiplication first: 4 * 3 = 12
2. Then add 2 to the result of the multiplication: 12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","Given the mathematical expression:

4 * 3 + 2

1,5+2 * 4,"1. First, we evaluate the multiplication operation: 2 * 4 = 8.
2. Then, we perform the addition operation: 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13.","1. Perform the multiplication operation first: 2 * 4 = 8.
2. Add the result of the multiplication to 5: 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13.","1. First, we perform the multiplication: 2 * 4 = 8.
2. Then, we add 5 to the result of the multiplication: 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13.","1. **Multiplication first:** 2 * 4 = 8.
2. **Addition next:** 5 + 8 = 13.

**The answer is 13.**"
1,5+3 * 2,"Given the expression: 5 + 3 * 2

1. Multiplication has precedence over addition, so we start by evaluating the multiplication first:
   3 * 2 = 6

2. Now we can substitute the result back into the expression:
   5 + 6

3. Finally, we evaluate the addition:
   5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.","Given the mathematical expression:

5 + 3 * 2

Following the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Multiplication:
3 * 2 = 6

2. Addition:
5 + 6 = 11

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 11.",PROBLEM.5+3=2 Answer.no,"1. Multiplication is performed before addition, so I calculate 3 * 2 = 6.
2. Adding the result of multiplication to the remaining term, I have 5 + 6 = 11.

1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"First, I'll perform the multiplication operations:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Then, I'll add the results:

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.

The answer is 54.","Multiply 7 by 2 and 8 by 5, then add the results:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","1. First, we perform the multiplication operations:
