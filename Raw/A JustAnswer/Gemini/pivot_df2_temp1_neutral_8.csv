1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"1. First, we evaluate the parentheses:
4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

2. Next, we perform the multiplication:
28 + 12 - 6

3. Finally, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
40 - 6

The answer is 34.

The answer is 34.","1. Start with the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.
2. Multiply 4 by 7: 4 * 7 = 28.
3. Add 12: 28 + 12 = 40.
4. Multiply 2 by 3: 2 * 3 = 6.
5. Subtract 6 from 40: 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34.","1. First, we perform the operations inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

2. Next, we multiply this result by 4:
4 * 7 = 28

3. Then, we add 12 to this result:
28 + 12 = 40

4. Finally, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3 from this result:
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","1. First, we need to perform the operations inside the parentheses:

2 + 5 = 7

2 * 3 = 6

2. Next, we perform the multiplication and division operations, working from left to right:

4 * 7 = 28

-2 * 6 = -12

3. Finally, we perform the addition and subtraction operations, working from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40

40 - (-12) = 40 + 12 = 52

The answer is 52."
1,4*3+2,"12 + 2 =

The answer is 14.","The given mathematical problem is:

4 * 3 + 2

Let's solve it step by step:

1. Perform the multiplication first:

4 * 3 = 12

2. Then, add the result to 2:

12 + 2 = 14

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 14.","1. First, we perform the multiplication operation: 4 * 3 = 12.
2. Then, we perform the addition operation: 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14.","1. Multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations. So, we start by evaluating the multiplication: 4 * 3 = 12.

2. Then, we add the result to 2: 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14."
1,5+2*4,"First, we perform the multiplication operation: 2 * 4 = 8.
Then, we add the result to 5: 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13.","5 + 2 * 4
= 5 + 8
= 13
The answer is 13.","**Problem:** 5 + 2 * 4

**Explanation:**
1. Perform multiplication first: 2 * 4 = 8
2. Then, perform addition: 5 + 8 = 13

**Answer:** The answer is 13.","1. Perform the multiplication operation first: 2 * 4 = 8.
2. Then, add the results of the multiplication to the remaining number: 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13."
1,5+3*2,"1. First, we need to perform the multiplication operation: 3 * 2 = 6.
2. Next, we add the result from step 1 to 5: 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11.","Given the mathematical expression:

5 + 3 * 2

1. Multiplication operation takes precedence over addition. So, we first evaluate 3 * 2:

3 * 2 = 6

2. Now, we can substitute the result of multiplication back into the expression:

5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.

The answer is 11.","1. First, we perform the multiplication operation: 3 * 2 = 6.
2. Then, we add the result to 5: 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11.","5 + 3 * 2
1. Multiplication: 3 * 2 = 6
2. Addition: 5 + 6 = 11
The answer is 11."
1,7*2+8*5,"7 * 2 + 8 * 5
= 14 + 40
= 54
The answer is 54.","**Step 1:** Perform the multiplication operations:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

**Step 2:** Add the results of the multiplication operations:

14 + 40 = 54

**Step 3:** Write the final answer:

The answer is 54.","1. First, I will perform the multiplication operations:
  - 7 * 2 = 14
  - 8 * 5 = 40

2. Then, I will add the results of the multiplication operations:
  - 14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","Here is an enhanced response that provides additional guidance and a concluding statement:

1. **Identify the Mathematical Problem:**
   Read the given mathematical problem carefully to understand what operation or calculation needs to be performed.

2. **Determine the Order of Operations:**
   Follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplications, Divisions, Addition, and Subtraction), to evaluate the expression step by step.

3. **Execute the Calculations:**
   Perform the calculations according to the order of operations. Evaluate parentheses first, then exponents, and so on.

4. **Provide a Clear and Concise Solution:**
   Write down your solution step by step, showing the intermediate steps and calculations. Use clear and concise language to explain each step.

5. **Provide the Final Answer:**
