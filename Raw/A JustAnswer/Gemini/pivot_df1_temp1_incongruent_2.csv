Explanation:

The order of operations is as follows:

1. Perform any operations within parenthesis.
2. Exponents (powers and square and other)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Additions and Subtraction (from left to right)

In this problem, we first perform the operation inside the parenthesis, which is (2 + 3), which results in 5. Then, we perform multiplication, which is 5 * 2, which results in 10.

The answer is 10."
