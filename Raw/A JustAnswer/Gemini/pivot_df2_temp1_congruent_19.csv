1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3
= 4*7 + 12 - 2*3
= 28 + 12 - 6
= 40 - 6
= 34
The answer is 34.","1. First, we evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses:
4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3
= 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3
= 28 + 12 - 6

2. Next, we perform the multiplication and division operations:
= 28 + 6
= 34

Therefore, the answer is 34.

The answer is 34.","1. Start with the parentheses:
    * 2 + 5 = 7

2. Next, perform the multiplication and division (from left to right):
    * 4 * 7 = 28
    * 2 * 3 = 6

3. Then, perform the addition and subtraction (also from left to right):
    * 28 + 12 = 40
    * 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","1. First, we solve the parentheses:

4*(7) + 12 - 2*3

2. Next, we perform the multiplication:

28 + 12 - 6

3. Then, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:

40 - 6

4. Finally, we get the answer:

The answer is 34."
