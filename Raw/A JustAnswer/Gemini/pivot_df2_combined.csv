**Question**:

What is the area of a circle with a diameter of 10 centimeters?

**Explanation**:

1. The diameter of a circle is the length of a straight line passing through the center of the circle and its two points of contact on the circle.
2. The relationship between the diameter and the area of a circle is given by the equation:
```
Area = (π/4) * (diameter^2)
```
3. In this case, the diameter is given as 10 centimeters.
4. Substituting this value into the equation:
```
Area = (π/4) * (10^2)
```
```
Area = (π/4) * (100)
```
5. Evaluating the expression:
```
Area ≈ (3.14/4) * (100)
```
```
Area ≈ 78.54
```

**The answer is approximately 78.54 square centimeters.**
