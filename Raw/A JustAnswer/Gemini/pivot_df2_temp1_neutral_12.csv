1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"4*(2+5)+12-2*3
= 4*7+12-2*3
= 28+12-6
= 40-6
= 34
The answer is 34.","1. 4*(2+5) = 4*7 = 28
2. 28 + 12 = 40
3. 40 - 2*3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","1. Start with the parentheses:

4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3
= 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3
= 28 + 12 - 2 * 3

2. Next, perform the multiplication inside the parentheses:

4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3
= 28 + 12 - 6
= 40 - 6

3. Now, perform the multiplication:

4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3
= 28 + 12 - 6
= 34

**The answer is 34.**","1. **Perform the operations inside the parentheses first:**
    * 2 + 5 = 7
    * 2 * 3 = 6

2. **Next, perform the multiplication and division operations from left to right:**
    * 4 * 7 = 28

3. **Finally, perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right:**
    * 28 + 12 - 6 = 34

**The answer is 34.**"
