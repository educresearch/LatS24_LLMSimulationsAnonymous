1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3
= 4*7 + 12 - 2*3
= 28 + 12 - 6
= 40 - 6
= 34
The answer is 34.","4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3

= 4*7 + 12 - 2*3

= 28 + 12 - 6

= 40 - 6

= 34

The answer is 34.","1. First, we perform the operations inside the parentheses:
$$4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3$$
$$4*(7) + 12 - 2*3$$

2. Next, we perform the multiplication operations:
$$4*(7) + 12 - 2*3$$
$$28 + 12 - 6$$

3. Then, we perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right:
$$28 + 12 - 6$$
$$40 - 6$$

4. Finally, we evaluate the remaining operations:
$$40 - 6$$
$$34$$

The answer is 34.","1. First, we perform the operations inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

2. Next, we perform the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28

3. Then, we add 12:
28 + 12 = 40

4. Finally, we subtract 2 * 3:
2 * 3 = 6
40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
1,4*3 + 2,"Given the arithmetic expression 4*3 + 2:

1. Multiplication Precedence: Multiplication has higher precedence than addition. So, we perform the multiplication first.
2. 4*3 = 12: Multiply 4 and 3 to get 12.
3. 12 + 2: Now, we add 12 and 2.
4. 12 + 2 = 14: The sum of 12 and 2 is 14.
