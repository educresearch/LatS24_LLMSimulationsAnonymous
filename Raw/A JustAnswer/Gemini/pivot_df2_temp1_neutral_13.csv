1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"1. Start with the operations inside the parentheses:
   4 * (2 + 5) = 4 * 7 = 28

2. Multiply 4 by 28:
   4 * 28 = 112

3. Add 12 to 112:
   112 + 12 = 124

4. Multiply 2 by 3:
   2 * 3 = 6

5. Subtract 6 from 124:
   124 - 6 = 118

The answer is 118.","Given: 4*(2+5) + 12 - 2*3

1. Start with the parentheses:
   4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28

2. Next, perform the multiplication:
   28 + 12 = 40

3. Then, evaluate the last term:
   2 * 3 = 6

4. Finally, subtract the result from the previous sum:
   40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","1. First, we perform the operations inside the parentheses:
\(2 + 5 = 7\)
\(2 \times 3 = 6\)

2. Next, we perform the multiplication and division from left to right:
\(4 \times 7 = 28\)

3. Finally, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
\(28 + 12 - 6 = 34\)

The answer is 34.","1. **Parentheses first:**

4 * (2 + 5) = 4 * 7

**Problem**:

Find the area of a triangle with a base of 10 cm and a height of 8 cm.

**Solution**:

The formula for the area of a triangle is:

```
Area = (base x height) / 2
```

Substituting the given values into the formula, we get:

```
Area = (10 cm x 8 cm) / 2 = 40 cm²
