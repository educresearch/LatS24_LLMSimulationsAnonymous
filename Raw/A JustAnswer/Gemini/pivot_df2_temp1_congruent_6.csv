1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3

= 4*7 + 12 - 2*3

= 28 + 12 - 6

= 40 - 6

= 34

The answer is 34.","1. First, we need to evaluate the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

2. Next, we will multiply 4 by 7:
4 * 7 = 28

3. Moving on, we will multiply -2 by 3:
-2 * 3 = -6

4. We will add 12 to 28:
28 + 12 = 40

5. Finally, we will subtract -6 from 40:
40 - (-6) = 40 + 6 = 46

The answer is 46.","1. First, we evaluate the parentheses:
4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3
= 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

2. Next, we perform the multiplication and division from left to right:
= 28 + 12 - 2 * 3
= 28 + 12 - 6

3. Finally, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
= 40 - 6

The answer is 34.","1. First, we perform the operations inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

2. Next, we multiply the result by 4:
4 * 7 = 28

3. Then, we add 12:
28 + 12 = 40

4. Finally, we subtract 2*3:
2*3 = 6
40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
1,4*3 + 2,"4*3 + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14
The answer is 14.","1. **Multiplication**: First, we perform the multiplication operation. 4 multiplied by 3 is 12.
2. **Addition**: Next, we add the result of the multiplication to the number 2. 12 plus 2 is 14.

The answer is 14.","1. Multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations. So, we first evaluate 4*3 = 12.
2. Then, we add 2 to 12: 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14.","1. Multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations. So, we'll start by multiplying 4 and 3.
2. 4*3 = 12
3. Now, we'll add 2 to 12.
4. 12 + 2 = 14
The answer is 14."

Order of Operations (PEMDAS): Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

1. Multiplication: 2*4 = 8

2. Addition: 5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.

The answer is 13.","1. First, we perform the multiplication operation. 2*4 = 8.
2. Then, we add the result of the multiplication to 5. 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13.","1. First, we need to perform the multiplication operation: 2 * 4 = 8.
2. Then, we add the result of the multiplication to 5: 5 + 8 = 13.

The final answer is 13.

The answer is 13."
1,5 + 3*2,"First, we evaluate the multiplication operation:
3 * 2 = 6
Then, we add the result to 5:
5 + 6 = 11
Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 11.","The answer is 8.

Explanation:

We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression to find the sum of the first 100 positive integers:

S = n(n+1)/2

where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, and d is the common difference.

In this case, n = 100 and d = 1.

Therefore, S = 100(100+1)/2 = 5050.

The sum of the first 100 positive integers is 5050.","1. First, we perform the multiplication operation: 3 * 2 = 6.
2. Then, we add the result of the multiplication to 5: 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11.","1. First, we perform the multiplication operation. 3 * 2 = 6.
2. Next, we add the result of the multiplication to 5. 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11."
1,7*2 + 8*5,"(7 * 2) + (8 * 5)
= 14 + 40
= 54
The answer is 54.","**Problem:**

7*2 + 8*5

**Solution:**

1. Multiply 7 and 2:

7*2 = 14

2. Multiply 8 and 5:

8*5 = 40

3. Add the results from steps 1 and 2:

14 + 40 = 54

**Answer:**

The answer is 54.","1. Multiplication and division are done before addition and subtraction.
2. 7*2 and 8*5 are evaluated first:
   a. 7*2 = 14
   b. 8*5 = 40

3. Now we can add 14 and 40:
   14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","1. Multiplication: 7*2 = 14 and 8*5 = 40.
2. Addition: 14 + 40 = 54.
