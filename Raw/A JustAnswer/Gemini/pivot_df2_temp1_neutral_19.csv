1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"4*(2+5)+12-2*3

First, we solve the parentheses:
4*7+12-2*3

Next, we perform the multiplication:
28+12-6

Then, we perform the addition and subtraction:
40-6

Finally, we find the difference:
34

The answer is 34.","1. 4*(2+5) = 4*7 = 28
2. 28 + 12 = 40
3. 40 - 2*3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","1. First, we perform the operations inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

2. Next, we perform the multiplication operations:
4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

3. Then, we perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right:
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","1. First, we need to perform the operations inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

2. Next, we multiply 4 by 7:
4 * 7 = 28

3. Then, we perform the addition:
28 + 12 = 40

4. Now, we multiply 2 by 3:
2 * 3 = 6

5. Finally, we subtract 6 from 40:
40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
1,4*3+2,"I can evaluate this simple arithmetic expression step by step:

The answer is 14.","**Problem:**

4 * 3 + 2

**Solution:**

1. Perform the multiplication operation first:

4 * 3 = 12

2. Add the result to 2:

12 + 2 = 14

**Answer:**

The answer is 14.","1. Perform multiplication first: 4 * 3 = 12
2. Then perform addition: 12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.","To solve the given mathematical problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and then Addition and Subtraction (also from left to right).

1. There are no parentheses or exponents, so we move on to multiplication and division.
2. Starting from the left, we have 4*3, which is 12.
3. Next, we move on to addition and subtraction. We have 12+2, which is 14.

The answer is 14.
