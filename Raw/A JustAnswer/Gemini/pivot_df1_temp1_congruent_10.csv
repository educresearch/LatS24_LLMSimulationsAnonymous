3. Finally, we perform the addition:

5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13."
1,,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"Given:

7 * 2 + 8 * 5

Solution:

First, we perform the multiplication operations inside the parentheses:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now, we substitute these values back into the expression:

14 + 40

Next, we perform the addition operation:

14 + 40 = 54

Therefore, the final answer is:

= 28 + 12 - 6

2. Next, perform the multiplication and division from left to right:
28 + 12 - 6
= 40 - 6

3. Finally, perform the subtraction:
40 - 6
= 34

Therefore, the expression 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3 evaluates to 34.
