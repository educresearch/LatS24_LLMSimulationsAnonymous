The answer is 34.","1. Start with the operations inside the parentheses first:
    * 4 × (2 + 5) = 4 × 7 = 28
    * 12 - 2 × 3 = 12 - 6 = 6

2. Then, perform the multiplication:
    * 28 + 6 = 34

The answer is 34.

The answer is 34.","1. First, we perform the operations inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

2. Next, we perform the multiplication operations:
4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

3. Then, we perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right:
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","1. Perform the operations inside the parentheses first:
    4 * (2 + 5) = 4 * 7 = 28

2. Next, perform the multiplication:
    28 + 12 - 2 * 3 = 28 + 12 - 6 = 34

3. Finally, perform the subtraction:

The answer is 13.

The answer is 13.","**Problem:**

5 + 2 * 4

**Solution:**

1. **Multiplication first:**

2 * 4 = 8

2. **Addition:**

5 + 8 = 13

**Answer:**

The answer is 13.","1. First, we perform the multiplication operation: 2 * 4 = 8.
2. Then, we perform the addition operation: 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13.","1. Multiplication should be done before addition.
2. 2 multiplied by 4 is 8.
3. 8 added to 5 is 13.

1,5+3*2,"1. Perform the multiplication operation first: 3 * 2 = 6
2. Add the result to 5: 5 + 6 = 11
The answer is 11.","Evaluating the expression using the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Perform multiplication first: 3 * 2 = 6.
2. Add the result to 5: 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11.

The answer is 11.","1. Multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations.
2. So, we first evaluate 3 * 2, which equals 6.
3. Then, we add 5 to 6, which equals 11.

The answer is 11.","1. Multiplication is done before addition.
2. 3 * 2 = 6.
