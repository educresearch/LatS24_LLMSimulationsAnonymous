1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"1. First, we simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28

2. Next, we perform the multiplication:
28 + 12 = 40

3. Finally, we perform the remaining multiplication and subtract:
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","1. First, evaluate the parentheses:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3
2. Next, perform the multiplication:
28 + 12 - 6
3. Then, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
40 - 6
4. Finally, evaluate the remaining expression:
34

The answer is 34.","1. First, we need to perform the operations inside the parentheses.
2. 2 + 5 = 7
3. 4 * 7 = 28
4. Next, we perform the multiplication operation.
5. 2 * 3 = 6
6. Now, we can perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right.
7. 28 + 12 = 40
8. 40 - 6 = 34
The answer is 34.","1. First, we need to evaluate the parentheses:
4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28
2. Next, we'll perform the multiplication and division from left to right:
28 + 12 - 2 * 3 = 28 + 12 - 6 = 34
3. Finally, we'll add and subtract from left to right:
34 - 6 = 28

The answer is 28."
1,4 * 3+2,"First, we perform the multiplication:

4 * 3 = 12

Then, we add 2 to the result:

12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","1. First, we perform the multiplication operation: 4 * 3 = 12.
   
2. Next, we add 2 to the result of the multiplication: 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14.","1. Multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations.
2. So, we first calculate 4 * 3 = 12.
3. Then, we add 2 to 12: 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14.","1. First, we follow the order of operations and perform the multiplication: 4 * 3 = 12.
2. Next, we perform the addition: 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14."
1,5+2 * 4,"1. Multiplication operation has precedence over addition, so we first evaluate 2 * 4.
2. 2 * 4 = 8.
3. Now we can evaluate the expression as 5 + 8.
4. 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13.","The order of operations dictates that multiplication should be done before addition. So, we first evaluate 2 * 4, which is 8. Then, we add 5 to 8, which is 13.

The answer is 13.","1. First, we evaluate the multiplication operation: 2 * 4 = 8.
2. Then, we add the result to 5: 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13.","1. Perform the multiplication first: 2 * 4 = 8
2. Then, add the result to 5: 5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13."
1,5+3 * 2,"1. First, we evaluate the multiplication operation: 3 * 2 = 6.
2. Then, we add the result of the multiplication to 5: 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11.

```
5 + 3 * 2
= 5 + 6
= 11
```

The answer is 11.",5+3   2 - 0 = 10 1个多莫大开莫,"1. First, we perform the multiplication operation: 3 * 2 = 6.
2. Then, we add the result of the multiplication to 5: 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11.","1. Multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations.
2. So, we first calculate 3 * 2 = 6.
3. Then, we add 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11."
1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"First, I will perform the multiplication operations:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Then, I will add the results of the multiplication operations:

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.


The answer is 54.","Given: 7 * 2 + 8 * 5

1. Perform the multiplication operations first:
   - 7 * 2 = 14
   - 8 * 5 = 40

2. Now, we have: 14 + 40

3. Add the two numbers:
   - 14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","1. First, we need to perform the multiplication operations:
   - 7 * 2 = 14
   - 8 * 5 = 40

2. Next, we can perform the addition operation:
   - 14 + 40 = 54

Therefore, the final answer is:
The answer is 54.","1. First, I will perform the multiplication operations:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

2. Next, I will add the results of the multiplication:

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54."
