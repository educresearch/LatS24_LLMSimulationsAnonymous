The answer is 70.","1. Start with the operations inside the parentheses first:
2 + 5 = 7

2. Multiply the result by 4:
4 * 7 = 28

3. Add 12 to the result:
28 + 12 = 40

4. Multiply 2 and 3:
2 * 3 = 6

5. Subtract the result from 40:
40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.

The answer is 34.","1. First, we need to perform the operations inside the parentheses:
    4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28

2. Next, we perform the multiplication and division from left to right:
    28 + 12 - 2 * 3 = 28 + 12 - 6 = 34

3. Finally, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
    34 - 6 = 28

The answer is 28.","1. **PEMDAS:** I'll follow the order of operations (PEMDAS): Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and then Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

2. **Parentheses:** I'll start with the parentheses: (2+5) = 7.

3. **Multiplication and Division:** Next, I'll perform the multiplication and division from left to right: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6.

4. **Addition and Subtraction:** Finally, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 - 6 = 34.

**The answer is 34.**"
1,4 * 3+2,"Given the expression:

4 * 3 + 2

1. Perform the multiplication first:

4 * 3 = 12

2. Then, perform the addition:

12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","1. Start with the multiplication operation first: 4 * 3 = 12.
2. Then, perform the addition: 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14.","1. Multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations.
2. So, first, we do 4 * 3, which equals 12.
3. Then, we add 2 to 12, which equals 14.

The answer is 14.","First, I will perform the multiplication:

4 * 3 = 12

Then, I will add the result to 2:

12 + 2 = 14

1,5+3 * 2,"1. Start with the multiplication operation:
3 * 2 = 6

2. Add the result of the multiplication to 5:
5 + 6 = 11

The final answer is:
The answer is 11.","I can solve this problem using the order of operations, which dictates that multiplication should be done before addition.

1. Multiply 3 and 2: 3 * 2 = 6
2. Add 5 to 6: 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.

The answer is 11.","1. Multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations. So, we need to perform the multiplication first.
2. 3 * 2 = 6
3. Now, we add 5 to the result of the multiplication:
4. 5 + 6 = 11
The answer is 11.","1. Multiplication is done before addition, so we first calculate 3 * 2, which equals 6.
2. Then, we add 5 to 6, which equals 11.
