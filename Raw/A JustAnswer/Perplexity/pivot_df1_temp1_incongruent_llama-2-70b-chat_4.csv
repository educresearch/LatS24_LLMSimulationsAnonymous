The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply this to the problem 4 * 3+2:

1. Parentheses: None
2. Exponents: None
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right): 4 * 3 = 12
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right): 12 + 2 = 14

Therefore, the answer is 14.

The order of operations tells us that we need to follow a specific set of steps when solving mathematical expressions. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the steps:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply this to the problem at hand: 5+2 * 4.

First, we need to evaluate any expressions inside parentheses. There are no parentheses in this problem, so we can move on to the next step.

Next, we need to look for any exponents. There are no exponents in this problem either, so we can skip to the next step.

Third, we need to evaluate any multiplication and division from left to right. In this case, we have 2 * 4, which equals 8.

Finally, we need to evaluate any addition and subtraction from left to right. We have 5 + 8, which equals 13.

Therefore, the answer is 13.

The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help!

The problem is 7 * 2+8 * 5.

First, we need to follow the order of operations. This means we need to do anything inside parentheses or brackets first, then exponents, then multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right.

In this case, we have two multiplication operations: 7 * 2 and 8 * 5. We need to do these operations in the order in which they appear from left to right.

So first, we multiply 7 by 2, which gives us 14.

Next, we multiply 8 by 5, which gives us 40.

Now we add 14 and 40, which gives us 54.

Therefore, the answer is 54.

The answer is  __54__.

The problem we're working on is 4 * 3+2.

The first thing we need to do is follow the order of operations. This means we need to do anything inside parentheses first, then exponents, then multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right.

In this case, we have parentheses, so we need to start by multiplying 4 and 3.

4 * 3 = 12

Next, we need to add 2 to 12.

12 + 2 = 14

So, the final answer is 14.
