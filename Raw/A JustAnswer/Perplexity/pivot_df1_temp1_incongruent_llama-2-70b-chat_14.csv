llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help!

The order of operations tells us to follow these steps:

1. Parentheses (if there are any)
2. Exponents (if there are any)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

In this problem, we don't have any parentheses or exponents, so we can start with step 3.

3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)

The problem is 5+2 * 4. The multiplication comes before the addition, so we need to calculate the multiplication first.

2 * 4 = 8

Now we add 5 and 8:

5 + 8 = 13

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help!

When we have multiple operations in an expression, we need to follow the Order of Operations to know which operation to perform first. The Order of Operations is often abbreviated as PEMDAS:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply PEMDAS to the expression 7 * 2+8 * 5:

1. Parentheses: None
2. Exponents: None
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right):
	* 7 * 2 = 14
	* 8 * 5 = 40
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right):
	* 14 + 40 = 54

Therefore, the final answer is 54.

So, the answer is 54."

The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:

1. Parentheses (if there are any)
2. Exponents (if there are any)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply this order to the expression 4 * 3+2:

1. Parentheses: None
2. Exponents: None
3. Multiplication and Division: 4 * 3 = 12
4. Addition and Subtraction: 12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.

So, the final answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Sure! Here's how to solve the problem using the order of operations:

1. First, evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses:

4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28

2. Next, evaluate the expression outside the parentheses:

28 + 12 = 40

3. Finally, subtract the last term:

40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Sure! Here's how I would solve this problem using the order of operations:

1. First, I would multiply 3 and 2, since multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations. This gives me 6.
