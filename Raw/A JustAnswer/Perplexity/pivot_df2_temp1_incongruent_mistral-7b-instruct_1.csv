Given expression: \(4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3\)

First, solve the expression inside the parentheses: \(2+5 = 7.\)

Now, multiply: \(4 * 7 = 28.\)

Next, do the subtraction: \(12-2 = 10.\)

Then, perform the multiplication: \(28 * 3 = 84.\)

Solve the expression in the parentheses:
4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3

Now, perform the operation inside the parentheses:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we do the multiplication and division, from left to right:

First, we have the parentheses: 
4 * (2+5)

Inside the parentheses, there is an addition operation, so we do that first:
4 * (7)

Now, there is still an operation inside the multiplication symbol:
4 * 7

We continue to follow the order of operations and do the multiplication:
28

Now, we have four terms in our expression: 28, the result of 2+5 in the parentheses, 12, and -2 * 3.

Let's follow the order of operations to combine them all:

1. The terms inside the parentheses were already calculated, so we move to the next term: 28 + 12

2. Perform addition: 40

3. The next term is -2 * 3:

  We follow the order of operations and do the multiplication first: -2 * 3 = -6

Now, we have only two terms: 40 and -6.

4. Add the terms from left to right:

 40 + (-6) = 34

First, we have a multiplication operation (3 * 2). We perform that before any addition because multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations.

So, 3 * 2 = 6

Now we have 5 + 6. Addition comes after multiplication in the order of operations, so we perform it next.

In this problem, there are no parentheses, exponents, or subtraction, so we will focus on multiplication and addition.

Since the multiplication symbol ""*"" comes before the addition symbol ""+"" in PEMDAS, we should perform the multiplication first. So, the problem becomes:

5 + 3 * 2

Now, we have only addition. Furthermore, since we're dealing with single-digit numbers, carrying over never occurs in this case. Therefore, addition follows the regular left-to-right order. However, since our multiplication was done before addition, our 3 * 2 results in 6.

Now, we add 5 and 6:
