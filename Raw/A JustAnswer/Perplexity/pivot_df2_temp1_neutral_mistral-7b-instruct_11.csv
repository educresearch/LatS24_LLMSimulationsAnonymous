mistral-7b-instruct,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Let's solve this step by step following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):

1. Parentheses: Solve the expression inside the parentheses first.
2 + 5 = 7

So now the expression looks like: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

2. Exponents: None in this expression

3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right):
First, perform the multiplication and division inside imaginative parentheses, going from left to right.
2 * 3 = 6

Now the expression looks like: 4 * 7 + 12 - 6

4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right):
First, perform addition and subtraction inside imaginative parentheses, going from left to right.
4 * 7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

The answer is: The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, let's do the operation inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

Then, we apply the multiplication and division:
4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now, we do the addition and subtraction, from left to right:
4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3
= 28 + 12 - 6

Adding 28 and 12:
= 40

Subtracting 6:
= 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Let's apply this to the given problem:

1. First, we have the inside parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.
2. Now we have 4 * 7 and 12 - 2 * 3. Since multiplication and division come before addition and subtraction, we'll take care of the multiplication first: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6.
3. Subtract 6 from 12: 12 - 6 = 6.
4. Lastly, perform the addition: 28 + 7 = 35.

So, the answer is 35.

The answer is 35.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

1. First, we have the addition inside the parentheses (2 + 5), so we do that: 2 + 5 = 7.
2. Now we have 4 times 7, which is multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28.
3. Next, we have another multiplication: 28 * 12 = 336.
4. Then there is subtraction: 336 - 2 * 3. According to PEMDAS, we should do the multiplication inside the subtraction first: 2 * 3 = 6, so the problem becomes 336 - 6 = 330.

In this problem, there are no parentheses or exponents. So the first step is to perform any multiplication or division, working from left to right.

We see that there is one multiplication operation: 4 * 3

So we do that first: 

4 * 3 = 12

Now there is only one mathematical operation left, which is addition:

12 + 2

So we do that next:

12 + 2 = 14

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Sure thing! The order of operations in mathematics is called PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In the given problem, there are no parentheses, exponents, or division, so we'll focus on multiplication and addition. Since multiplication comes before addition in PEMDAS, we should perform the multiplication first.

So, we'll start by multiplying 4 and 3: 4 x 3 = 12

Now, we have the result of the multiplication: 12

Next, we add the number we got from the multiplication (12) to the number that was being multiplied in the first place (2).

So, 12 + 2 = 14

mistral-7b-instruct,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 2 * 4, we need to follow the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this equation, the only arithmetic operation indicated is multiplication (2 * 4). So, we should perform that first following the multiplication rule which is to multiply any number of digits and numbers that are grouped together by a multiplication symbol.

When we multiply 2 and 4, we get the result: 8

Now that we have the multiplication result, we can return to the original expression and perform the addition operation (5 + 8) with the multiplication result (8) as the second operand.

To add 5 and 8:

5 + 8 = 13
