      <td>GPT Response: Hello! I'd be happy to help you understand how to solve the math problem you've given using the order of operations. The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us the order in which we should perform mathematical operations to ensure that we get the correct answer. The order of operations is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>For the problem 7 * 2 + 8 * 5, let's go through the order of operations step by step:<br><br>1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in this problem, so we can move on to the next step.<br>2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this problem, so we can move on to the next step.<br>3. Multiplication and Division: We have two multiplication operations in this problem: 7 * 2 and 8 * 5. We should perform these operations from left to right. So, we first calculate 7 * 2, which equals 14. Then, we calculate 8 * 5, which equals 40.<br>4. Addition and Subtraction: Now we have one addition operation: 14 + 40. We perform this operation last, because addition comes after multiplication in the order of operations. So, we calculate 14 + 40, which equals 54.<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
