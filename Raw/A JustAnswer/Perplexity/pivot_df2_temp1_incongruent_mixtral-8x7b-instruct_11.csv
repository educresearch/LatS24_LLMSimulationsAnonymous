1. First, solve the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.
2. Now, multiply 4 by the result: 4 * 7 equals 28.
3. Then, add the number outside the parentheses: 28 + 12 equals 40.
4. Next, multiply 2 by 3: 2 * 3 equals 6.
5. Finally, subtract this result from the previous total: 40 - 6 equals 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure! The Mathematics problem is: 4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3.
