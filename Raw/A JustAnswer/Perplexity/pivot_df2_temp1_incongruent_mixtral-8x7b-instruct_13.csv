mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Let's solve this expression using the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

The given expression is: 
4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3

First, perform the operation inside the parentheses:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, do the multiplication and division from left to right:
28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, do the addition and subtraction from left to right:
40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we should follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, solve the operation in the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7

Then, multiply: 4 * 7 = 28

Next, add: 28 + 12 = 40

Lastly, multiply: 2 * 3 = 6

And subtract: 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Let's solve this step by step following the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

1. First, solve the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7
2. Then, multiply 4 by the result: 4 * 7 = 28
3. Now, add the number outside the parentheses: 28 + 12 = 40
4. Lastly, multiply: 40 - 2 * 3. According to PEMDAS, we should do multiplication before subtraction. So, 2 * 3 = 6, and then 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure! The Mathematics problem is: 4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3.

To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, let's do the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.

So the problem becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, we do multiplication and division from left to right. We first multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. Then we multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6.

So the problem becomes: 28 + 12 - 6.

Lastly, we do addition and subtraction from left to right. We first add 28 and 12, which equals 40. Then we subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: In this problem, there is an ambiguity in the order of operations, also known as BIDMAS or PEMDAS, which stands for Brackets/parentheses, Indices/Exponents, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

According to this rule, we should perform multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. Therefore, we should first multiply 4 by 3, and then add 2.
