llama-2-70b-chat,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's how we can solve the problem:

4*(2 + 5) = 4*(7) = 28

28 + 12 = 40

40 - 2*3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.

Explanation:

* First, we multiply 4 by the expression inside the parentheses, which gives us 4*7 = 28.
* Next, we add 12 to 28, which gives us 40.
* Finally, we subtract 2 times 3 from 40, which gives us 40 - 6 = 34.

Therefore, the final answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure! Here's how to solve the problem:

First, let's evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:

4*(2 + 5) = 4*7 = 28

Next, let's add 12:

28 + 12 = 40

Finally, let's subtract 2 times 3:

40 - 6 = 34

The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply PEMDAS to the expression 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3:

1. Parentheses: inside the parentheses we have 2 + 5 = 7
2. Exponents: there are no exponents in this expression
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right): 4*7 = 28
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right): 28 + 12 = 40

So, the final answer is 40.

The answer is 40.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

The problem is 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3.

First, we need to follow the order of operations, which is PEMDAS:

The problem we're trying to solve is 5 + 3*2.

The first thing we need to do is follow the order of operations. This means we need to do anything that is inside parentheses first. In this case, we have 3*2 inside parentheses.

So, let's start by multiplying 3 and 2.

3 x 2 = 6

Now, we need to add 5 to the result of 6.

5 + 6 = 11
