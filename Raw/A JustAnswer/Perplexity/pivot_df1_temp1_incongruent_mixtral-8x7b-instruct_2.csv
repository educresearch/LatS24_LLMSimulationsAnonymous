mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Let's solve this step by step using the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction).

1. Parentheses: We start by solving the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.
2. Multiplication and Division: Next, we do any multiplication and division from left to right. We have two multiplication operations: 4 * 7 (from the first multiplication sign) and 2 * 3. Calculate 4 * 7 first, which equals 28. Keep 2 * 3 for later.
3. Addition and Subtraction: Lastly, do addition and subtraction from left to right. We have the addition 4 * 7 + 12, which equals 36, and the subtraction 36 - 2 * 3. Before moving on to addition, perform the remaining multiplication: 2 * 3 equals 6. Now, subtract that from the previous result: 36 - 6, which equals 30.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, within the parentheses, we need to do addition: 2 + 5 equals 7.

So, the equation now looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, we do multiplication: 4 * 7 equals 28 and 2 * 3 equals 6.

So, the equation now looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.

Then, we do addition and subtraction from left to right: first, we add 28 and 12, which gives us 40.

So, the equation now looks like this: 40 - 6.

Finally, we subtract: 40 - 6 equals 34.
