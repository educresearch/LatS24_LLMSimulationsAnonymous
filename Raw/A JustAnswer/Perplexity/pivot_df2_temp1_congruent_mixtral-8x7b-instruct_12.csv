mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Let's solve this expression by following the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.

First, solve the expression in the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7

Now, multiply: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6

Then, add and subtract in order from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40 and 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we solve the expression in parentheses:

4 * (2 + 5) = 4 * 7 = 28

So the equation now becomes:

28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we do the multiplication:

2 * 3 = 6, so the equation becomes:

28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40, and then 40 - 6 = 34

So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: Let's solve this step by step using the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS:

1. Parentheses: First, we evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7
2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this expression, so we can skip this step.
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right):
   a. 4 * 7 = 28
   b. 2 * 3 = 6
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right):
   a. 28 + 12 = 40
   b. 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that problem!

When we have a mathematical expression like the one you provided, we need to follow a specific order to solve it correctly.
