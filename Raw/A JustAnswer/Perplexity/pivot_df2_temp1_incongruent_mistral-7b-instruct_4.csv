mistral-7b-instruct,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Let's solve this step by step according to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):

1. Parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7
2. Multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28
3. Addition and subtraction (from left to right): 28 + 12 = 40
4. Last multiplication: 2 * 3 = 6
5. Last addition and subtraction: 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we will take care of the parentheses: 4 * (2+5)

Now, solve the expression inside the parentheses: 4 * (2+5) = 4 * (7) = 4 * 7 = 28

So, our expression now looks like: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we have addition and subtraction from left to right. Let's start with the first addition: 28 + 12

Now, add the numbers: 28 + 12 = 3 + 12 = 13 (we carried over the 1 from the 28 when adding 2 and 5)

Our expression is now: 13 - 2 * 3

Next, we have multiplication from left to right: 13 - 6

Multiply: 13 * 3 = 39

Last, we have to do the subtraction: 13 - 6 = 7

So, we followed all the steps according to the order of operations and arrived at the final answer:

The answer is 7.","GPT Response: To solve the given expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we perform the calculation inside the parentheses:

2 + 5 = 7

Now, we have:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we perform multiplication and division from left to right:

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

So now the expression looks like this:

28 + 12 - 6

Then, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right:

12 + 6 = 18
18 - 6 = 12

Finally, we have the answer:

The answer is 12.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, let's deal with the parentheses:

4 * (2+5)

The expression inside the parentheses is 2+5, or 7. So, the calculation becomes:

4 * 7

Next, we have multiplication:

4 * 7 = 28

Now, we have addition and subtraction. However, we don't have any subtraction yet, so we'll just focus on the addition part for now:

28 + 12

The answer is now 40. But, we still need to do the subtraction part, which is -2 * 3.

40 - 2 * 3

According to the PEMDAS rule, we should do the multiplication part before the subtraction. So, let's calculate -2 * 3 first:

-2 * 3 = -6

Now, we can subtract it from the previous result:

40 - (-6) = 40 + 6 = 46

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 46."
