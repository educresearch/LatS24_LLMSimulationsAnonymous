Since there are no exponents, multiplication, or division inside the expression, we move to the last step.

Step 4: Do the addition and subtraction operations.
Add 28 and 12: 28 + 12 = 40
Subtract 2 from 40: 40 - 2 = 38

So, The answer is 38."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: The order of operations in mathematics is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this problem, we don't have any parentheses or exponents, so we'll move on to the next step. The multiplication operation (3*2) needs to be done before the addition (5 + _). 

So, let's perform the multiplication first: 

3 * 2 = 6

Now we have: 

5 + 6

The addition operation comes last, so we'll complete that step: 

5 + 6 = 11

The answer is: 

The answer is 11."
