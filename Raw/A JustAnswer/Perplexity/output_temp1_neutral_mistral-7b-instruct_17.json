Next, we deal with the Multiplication and Division (from left to right): 4 * 7 = 28, and 2 * 3 = 6.\nSo now we have: 28 + 12 - 6\n\n3. Now we doAddition and Subtraction (from left to right). First, we add 12 to 28: 28 + 12 = 40. Then, we subtract 6 from 40: 40 - 6 = 34.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n**The answer is 34.**"}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500", "model": "mistral-7b-instruct", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 500, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in grade 6 learning order of operations for the first time.\n                    Explain your solution to this given Mathematics problem, and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "5+3*2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations which is also known as PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nIn this problem \"3*2\" falls under the multiplication category in PEMDAS.
