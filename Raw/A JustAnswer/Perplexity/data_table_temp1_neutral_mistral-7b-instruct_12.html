      <td>GPT Response: This problem involves the distributive property of multiplication over addition, also known as the FOIL method when dealing with more complex expressions. However, in this simple case, the parentheses are not needed, and the problem can be solved using the order of operations, which is represented by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponent, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>Given the expression 5 + 2*4, following the order of operations:<br><br>1. Since there are no parentheses, exponents, or multiplication/division inside them, we proceed with the addition and multiplication.<br><br>First, we perform the multiplication since the multiplication sign has a higher precedence (associativity from left to right) than addition: 2*4 = 8<br><br>2. Subsequently, we perform the addition: 5 + 8<br><br>The answer is __:<br>13.<br><br>So, the answer to the expression 5 + 2*4 is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: The rule for the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), states that we should perform multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. Based on this rule, we should first do the multiplication operation, which is 2 multiplied by 4. That equals 8. Then we add 5 to the result. So the calculation would be:<br><br>5 + (2 * 4)<br>= 5 + (8)<br>= 5 + 8<br>= 13<br><br>The answer is: 13.</td>
