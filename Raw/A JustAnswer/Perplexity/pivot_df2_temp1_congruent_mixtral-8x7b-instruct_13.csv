mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this expression, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, according to the order of operations, we need to perform the operation inside the parentheses:

4 * (7) + 12 - 2*3

Next, perform multiplication:

28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, do addition and subtraction from left to right:

40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, perform the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7

Then, multiply: 4 * 7 = 28

Next, add the number 12 to the result: 28 + 12 = 40

Finally, perform the remaining multiplication and subtraction from left to right: 2 * 3 = 6, and subtract that from the previous result: 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Let's solve this step by step using the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction).

1. First, we do the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.
2. Now we have: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3
3. Next, we do multiplication and division from left to right: 4 * 7 equals 28 and 2 * 3 equals 6.
4. So now we have: 28 + 12 - 6
5. Lastly, we do addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 equals 40 and 40 - 6 equals 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we need to solve the operation inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5. The result is 7.

So, the equation becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we follow the order of operations, which means we should do the multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. So, we calculate the multiplications first: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6.

So, the equation becomes: 28 + 12 - 6

Now, we do addition and subtraction from left to right. So, we first add 28 and 12, which gives us 40.

So, the equation becomes: 40 - 6

Finally, we subtract 6 from 40, which gives us 34.
