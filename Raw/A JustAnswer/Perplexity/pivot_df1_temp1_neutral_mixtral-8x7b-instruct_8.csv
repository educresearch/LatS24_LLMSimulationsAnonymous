mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: When solving mathematical expressions, it's important to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this expression, multiplication comes before addition, so we should perform the multiplication operation first:

2 * 4 = 8

Now, our expression looks like this:

5 + 8

Finally, we perform the addition operation:

5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13."

At first glance, it might seem like we should do addition first since it comes before multiplication in the problem. However, multiplication is one of the operations in PEMDAS that comes before addition, so we should actually do the multiplication first.

So, we multiply 2 and 4 to get 8.

Then, we add the result of that multiplication (which is 8) to 5.

5 + 8 equals 13.

The answer is 13."

In our problem, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we move on to multiplication and division. We see the * symbol twice, but we do these operations from left to right. 

First, we multiply 7 and 2, which equals 14.
Then, we multiply 8 and 5, which equals 40.

Now, we have one addition operation left:
14 (the result from the first multiplication) + 40 (the result from the second multiplication)

When we add these two numbers together, we get 54.
