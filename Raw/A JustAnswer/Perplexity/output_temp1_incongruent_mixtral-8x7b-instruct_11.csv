2 + 5 = 7

So, the expression becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, we perform multiplication and division from left to right. We do the multiplication first: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6.

So, the expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 6.

Lastly, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right. We add 28 + 12 = 40, and then subtract 6 from 40: 40 - 6 = 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34."

In this problem, we have:

5 + 3 \* 2

First, we need to do the multiplication because it comes before addition in the order of operations:

5 + 6

Now, we can do the addition:

11

The answer is 11."
