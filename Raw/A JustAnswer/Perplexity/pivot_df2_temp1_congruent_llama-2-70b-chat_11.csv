The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure, I can help you with that!

The order of operations tells us to follow these steps:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents (none in this case)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

So, let's follow these steps and solve the problem:

1. Parentheses: inside the parentheses we have 2 + 5 = 7
2. Multiplication and Division: 4 * 7 = 28
3. Addition and Subtraction: 28 + 12 = 40
4. Finally, we subtract 2 * 3 = 6

The answer is 40 - 6 = 34.

Therefore, the final answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply this order to the given problem:

4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3

First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7

Now, we can multiply 4 by 7: 4*7 = 28

Next, we add 12: 28 + 12 = 40

Finally, we subtract 2 times 3: 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."

Explanation: The order of operations tells us to perform multiplication before addition. So, we multiply 4 and 3 first, getting 12. Then, we add 2 to 12, getting 14.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

The problem is 4*3 + 2.

First, we need to follow the order of operations, which is PEMDAS:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

In this case, we don't have any parentheses or exponents, so we can start with the multiplication.

4*3 = 12

Now, we add 2 to 12:

12 + 2 = 14

Therefore, the answer is 14.
