In this problem, we have neither parentheses nor exponents, so we move on to multiplication and division. We see the number 3 is being multiplied by 2.

3 * 2 = 6

Now our expression looks like this: 

5 + 6

Next, we perform addition (since there are no more multiplications, divisions, exponents, or parentheses):

5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11."
