llama-2-70b-chat,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Sure! Here's the step-by-step explanation for the given mathematics problem:

4*(2+5) = 4*7 = 28
12 - 2*3 = 12 - 6 = 6

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 28 + 6 = 34.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

The given expression is:

4*(2+5)+12-2*3

First, let's evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:

4*(2+5) = 4*7 = 28

Now, let's add 12:

28 + 12 = 40

Finally, let's subtract 2 times 3:

40 - 6 = 34

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure, I can help you with that!

The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:

1. Parentheses (if any)
2. Exponents (if any)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply this order to the given expression:

4*(2+5)+12-2*3

Step 1: Evaluate expressions inside parentheses.
The expression inside parentheses is 2+5, which evaluates to 7.

Step 2: Evaluate exponents (there are none in this case).

Step 3: Evaluate multiplication and division from left to right.
We have 4*7 = 28.

Step 4: Evaluate addition and subtraction from left to right.
We have 28 + 12 = 40.

Step 5: Simplify the final answer.
The answer is 40.

So, the final answer is:
The answer is 40.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

The problem we're given is 4*(2+5)+12-2*3. Let's start by following the order of operations:

1. Parentheses: inside the parentheses we have 2+5 = 7
2. Exponents (none in this case)
3. Multiplication: 4*7 = 28
4. Addition: 28 + 12 = 40
5. Subtraction: 40 - 2*3 = 40 - 6 = 34

Therefore, the final answer is:

llama-2-70b-chat,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Sure! Here's how we can solve this problem step by step:

4*3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: My solution to the problem 4*3+2 is as follows:

1. Multiply 4 and 3: 4*3 = 12
2. Add 2: 12+2 = 14

Therefore, the answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Sure! Here's how I would solve the problem using the order of operations:

1. Multiply 4 and 3: 4 Ã— 3 = 12
2. Add 2: 12 + 2 = 14
