First, according to the order of operations, we need to solve the expression in the parentheses:

2 + 5 = 7

So, the expression becomes:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we perform multiplication and division from left to right:

4 * 7 = 28, so the expression becomes:

28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Then, we continue with multiplication:

2 * 3 = 6, so the expression becomes:

28 + 12 - 6

Finally, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40, so the expression becomes:

40 - 6

And, 40 - 6 = 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure! The Mathematics problem is: 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3. We need to solve this using the order of operations, which is also known as BIDMAS or PEMDAS.
