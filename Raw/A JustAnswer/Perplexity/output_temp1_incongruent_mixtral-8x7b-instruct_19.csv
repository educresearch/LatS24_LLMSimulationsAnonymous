At first glance, the problem 5 + 3 * 2 might seem like you should do addition first. But according to the order of operations, multiplication comes before addition.

So, here's how we solve it:

1. Multiply 3 and 2 to get 6.
2. Then add 5 to the result of the multiplication.

Following these steps, we find that:

5 + 3 * 2 = 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11."
