The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply PEMDAS to the given expression:

4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3

1. Parentheses: inside the parentheses we have 2 + 5 = 7
2. Multiplication: 4*7 = 28
3. Addition and Subtraction: 28 + 12 = 40
4. Remaining multiplication: 40 - 2*3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.

So, the final answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations:

1. Parentheses: inside the parentheses we have 2 + 5 = 7
2. Exponents (none in this case)
3. Multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28
4. Addition: 28 + 12 = 40
5. Subtraction: 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34
