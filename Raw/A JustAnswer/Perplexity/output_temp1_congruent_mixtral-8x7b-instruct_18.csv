40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."

In our problem, we have neither parentheses nor exponents, so we move to the next step which is Multiplication and Division. We see the number 3 multiplied by 2, so we perform this operation first:

5 + 3*2 = 5 + 6

Now, we have only addition left, so we perform it:

5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11."
