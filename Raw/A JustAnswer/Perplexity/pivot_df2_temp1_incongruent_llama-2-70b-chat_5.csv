llama-2-70b-chat,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's the step-by-step explanation for the given mathematics problem:

4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure! Here's how to solve the problem:

1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 2+5 = 7
2. Multiply 4 by the result: 4 * 7 = 28
3. Add 12: 28 + 12 = 40
4. Subtract 2 times 3: 40 - 6 = 34

The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:

1. Parentheses (if there are any)
2. Exponents (if there are any)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply this order to the given expression:

4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3

First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 2+5 = 7

So, the expression becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we multiply 4 and 7: 4 * 7 = 28

Then, we add 12: 28 + 12 = 40

Finally, we subtract 2 * 3: 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.

I hope this helps you understand how to apply the order of operations to solve expressions like this one!","GPT Response: Sure! Here's how I would solve the problem using the order of operations:

1. First, we need to follow the parentheses. Inside the parentheses we have 2+5 = 7
2. Next, we need to multiply 4 by 7 = 28
3. Then, we need to add 12 = 28 + 12 = 40
4. Finally, we need to subtract 2 times 3 = 40 - 6 = 34
