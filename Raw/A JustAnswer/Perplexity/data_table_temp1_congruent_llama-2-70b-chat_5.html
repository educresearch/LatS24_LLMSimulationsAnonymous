      <td>GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's how we can solve this problem using the order of operations:<br><br>1. First, we need to follow the parentheses rule, which says that we need to evaluate any expressions inside parentheses before moving on to the next step. In this case, we have parentheses around 2 + 5.<br>2. Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5 = 7<br>3. Next, we need to follow the exponents rule, which says that we need to evaluate any exponents (such as squaring or cubing) before moving on to the next step. In this case, we have none.<br>4. Then we need to follow the multiplication rule, which says that we need to evaluate any multiplication from left to right. In this case, we have 4*7 = 28<br>5. After that, we need to follow the addition and subtraction rules, which say that we need to evaluate any addition and subtraction from left to right. In this case, we have 28 + 12 = 40 and 40 - 2*3 = 40 - 6 = 34<br><br>Therefore, the final answer is:<br><br>The answer is 34.<br><br>I hope that helps!
