systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we have to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In our problem, we have only addition and multiplication. According to PEMDAS, we should do the multiplication first:

3 * 2 = 6

Now, our original problem looks like this: 5 + 6

Next, we do addition:

5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11."
