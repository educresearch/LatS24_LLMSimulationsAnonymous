llama-2-70b-chat,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

First, let's follow the order of operations:

1. Parentheses: inside the parentheses we have 2+5 = 7
2. Exponents (none in this case)
3. Multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28
4. Addition: 28 + 12 = 40
5. Subtraction: 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

Therefore, the final answer is 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's how to solve the problem:

4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28

Add 12:

28 + 12 = 40

Subtract 2 * 3:

40 - 6 = 34

Therefore, the answer is 34.

So, the final answer is: The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure! Here's how we can solve this problem using the order of operations:

1. First, we need to follow the parentheses. Inside the parentheses we have 2+5, which equals 7.
2. Next, we multiply 4 by 7, which gives us 28.
3. Then, we add 12 to 28, which gives us 40.
4. Finally, we subtract 2 times 3, which is 6, from 40.

The answer is 34.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

Therefore, the final answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

2. Add 2: 12 + 2 = 14

Therefore, the final answer is:
The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:

1. Parentheses (if there are any)
2. Exponents (if there are any)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply this order to the expression 4 * 3+2:

1. Parentheses: None
2. Exponents: None
3. Multiplication and Division: We have 4 * 3, which we need to evaluate first. The product is 12.
4. Addition and Subtraction: We have 12 + 2, which gives us a final answer of 14.

The answer is 14.
