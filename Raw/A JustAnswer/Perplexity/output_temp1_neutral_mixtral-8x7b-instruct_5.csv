systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In our problem, we have neither parentheses nor exponents. So, we move on to multiplication. 

3 times 2 equals 6. 

So, the expression becomes:

5 + 6

Now, we perform addition:

5 + 6 equals 11.

So, the answer is 11."
