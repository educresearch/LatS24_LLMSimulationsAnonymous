The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply this order to the expression 5 + 2*4:

1. First, we multiply 2 and 4: 2*4 = 8
2. Next, we add 5 and 8: 5 + 8 = 13

So, the final answer is 13.

Explanation:

The order of operations tells us to evaluate expressions inside parentheses first, so we start by adding 2 and 5 to get 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. Next, we add 12 to get 40. Finally, we subtract 2 times 3 to get 34. That's our final answer!"

llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

The problem is 5 + 2*4.

First, we need to follow the order of operations, which is PEMDAS:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

In this case, we have parentheses, so we need to evaluate what's inside the parentheses first.

Inside the parentheses we have 2*4, which is equal to 8.

So, the problem becomes 5 + 8.

Now, we add 5 and 8, which gives us 13.

The answer is 13.

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 13."
