      <td>GPT Response: To solve this mathematics problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction).<br><br>First, we will deal with the parentheses, if there were any in the given problem. In this case, there are no parentheses, so we move on to the next step.<br><br>Next, we will handle any exponents, if present. Since there are no exponents here, we proceed to the next step.<br><br>Now, we focus on the multiplication and division, from left to right. There are two multiplication operations in the problem: 4*(2+5) and 2*3. According to PEMDAS rule, we should perform multiplication and division in the order they appear left to right. So, let's calculate 2*3 first: 2*3 = 6. Now, we will do the multiplication inside the parentheses: 4* (2+5) = 4*7 = 28. Now, we put the result, 28, back in the place of the multiplication and replace it with the product: 4*(2+5) = 28.<br><br>Lastly, we will finish the problem by dealing with addition and subtraction, again from left to right. There are two addition and one subtraction in the problem: 28+12-2. Doing the addition first, we get 28+12 = 40. Then, we subtract 2 from 40 to get the final result: 40-2 = 38.<br><br>The answer is 38.</td>
