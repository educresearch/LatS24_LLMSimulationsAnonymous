mistral-7b-instruct,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: To solve this expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we need to resolve the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7
Now, we have: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we perform multiplication and division (from left to right):
4 * 7 = 28
-2 * 3 = -6
28 + 12 + (-6)

Now, we do addition and subtraction (from left to right):
28 + 12 = 40

Given expression: 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3

Step 1: Solve the expression inside the parentheses: 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3 => 4 * (7)+12-2 * 3

Step 2: Perform multiplication and division from left to right. However, there is no multiplication or division in this step, so we move to the next step.

Step 3: Perform addition and subtraction from left to right.

First, subtract 2 from 12: 4 * (7)+12-2 * 3 => 4 * (7)+10-2 * 3

Then, perform multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28, 2 * 3 = 6. So, 4 * (7)+10-2 * 3 => 28+10-6

Lastly, perform addition and subtraction: 28+10-6 = 34

The answer is: 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Let's apply it step by step:

1. Parentheses: Solve the expression inside the parentheses first.
   2 + 5 = 7

2. Multiplication and Division (from left to right): Solve any multiplication or division that is not inside parentheses.
   We don't have multiplication or division outside of parentheses in this expression. So we move on to the next step.

3. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right): Solve any addition or subtraction that is not inside parentheses.
   We have three terms to consider:

  a. 4 * 7 (obtained from 4 * (2+5))
  b. 12
  c. -2 * 3

  Following the involved order of subtraction, we first do the multiplication:
  4 * 7 = 28
  Then, perform the addition: 28 + 12 = 32
  Lastly, subtraction: 32 - 2 * 3 (we use the distributive property here: 32 - 2 * 3 = 32 - 6 = 26)

The answer is __.
