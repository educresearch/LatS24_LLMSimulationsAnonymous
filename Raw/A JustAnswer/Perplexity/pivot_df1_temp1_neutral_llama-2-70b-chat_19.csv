When we have multiplication and addition in the same expression, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us which operations to perform first.

The order of operations is:

1. Parentheses (if there are any)
2. Exponents (if there are any)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

In the expression 7*2+8*5, we have multiplication and addition. Let's follow the order of operations to solve this expression.

Step 1: Multiply 7 and 2.
7*2 = 14

Step 2: Multiply 8 and 5.
8*5 = 40

Step 3: Add 14 and 40.
14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.

So, the final answer is 54."

The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:

1. Parentheses (if there are any)
2. Exponents (if there are any)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply this order to the expression 4*3+2:

1. Parentheses: None
2. Exponents: None
3. Multiplication and Division: We have 4*3 = 12
4. Addition and Subtraction: We have 12 + 2 = 14

llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's how we can solve this problem using the order of operations:

Step 1: Parentheses
The problem has parentheses in two places: 2+5 and 2*3. When we encounter parentheses, we need to follow the expression inside the parentheses first. So, let's start by adding 2 and 5:

2+5 = 7

Now, let's multiply 2 by 3:

2*3 = 6

Step 2: Exponents (None in this case)
Since there are no exponents in this problem, we can move on to the next step.

Step 3: Multiplication
The next operation is multiplication. We have two multiplication operations: 4*7 and 12. Let's multiply 4 by 7:

4*7 = 28

Now, let's multiply 12 by 1 (since there is no number in front of the 12):

12*1 = 12

Step 4: Addition and Subtraction
Now we have two addition and subtraction operations: 28 + 12 and 28 - 6. Let's add 28 and 12:

28 + 12 = 40

Now, let's subtract 6 from 40:

40 - 6 = 34

And that's it! We've solved the problem.

The answer is 34."
