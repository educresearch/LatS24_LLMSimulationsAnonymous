The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:

1. Parentheses (if there are any)
2. Exponents (if there are any)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply this order to the expression 4*3+2:

1. First, we multiply 4 and 3: 4*3 = 12
2. Next, we add 2: 12 + 2 = 14

So, the final answer is: The answer is 14."

Let's apply this order to the given expression:

4*(2+5)+12-2*3

First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 2+5 = 7

Next, we multiply 4 by 7: 4*7 = 28

Then, we add 12 to 28: 28 + 12 = 40

Finally, we subtract 2 times 3 from 40: 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.

The problem is 5+2*4.

First, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations says that we have to do anything that is inside parentheses first. In this case, we have 2*4 inside parentheses.

So, we need to multiply 2 and 4. 2*4 = 8.

Now, we can add 5 and 8. 5 + 8 = 13.

Therefore, the answer is 13.

llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Okay! To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. That means we need to do anything that is inside of parentheses first, then do any exponents (like squaring or cubing), then do multiplication and division from left to right, and finally do addition and subtraction from left to right.

In this problem, we don't have any parentheses or exponents, so we can start with the multiplication. 4 times 3 is 12.

Next, we need to add 2 to 12. 12 + 2 is 14.

The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:
