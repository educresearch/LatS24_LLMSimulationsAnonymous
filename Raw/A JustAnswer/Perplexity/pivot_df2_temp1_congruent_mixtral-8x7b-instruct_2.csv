So,

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this problem, we have:

4 (this is the first number we see, but since multiplication comes before addition in PEMDAS, we shouldn't start with this number)
* (this tells us to multiply)
3 (this is the second number we should look at, since multiplication comes before addition in PEMDAS)
+ (this tells us to add)
2 (this is the third number we see)

So, to follow the order of operations, we should first multiply 4 and 3. The result is 12.
