llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Sure! Here's how we can solve this problem using the order of operations:

1. Multiply 7 and 2: 7 * 2 = 14
2. Multiply 8 and 5: 8 * 5 = 40
3. Add 14 and 40: 14 + 40 = 54

So, the final answer is: 54.

The order of operations is important because it helps us perform calculations in the correct order. In this case, we had to multiply before adding, because multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations. If we had added 14 and 40 first, we would have gotten 54, which is not the correct answer. By following the order of operations, we can avoid making mistakes and get the right answer."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:

1. Parentheses (if there are any)
2. Exponents (if there are any)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply this order to the expression 4 * 3+2:

1. Parentheses: None
2. Exponents: None
3. Multiplication and Division: 4 * 3 = 12
4. Addition and Subtraction: 12 + 2 = 14

Therefore, the answer is 14.
