The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:

1. Parentheses (if there are any)
2. Exponents (if there are any)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply this order to the expression 5+2*4:

1. There are no parentheses, so we move on to the next step.
2. There are no exponents, so we move on to the next step.
3. We see that there is a multiplication operation, 2*4, so we need to perform that first.
4. We multiply 2 and 4 to get 8.
5. Now we need to add 5 and 8.
6. We add 5 and 8 to get 13.

The answer is 13.

The problem is 5+3*2, and the first thing we need to do is follow the order of operations. The order of operations is like a set of instructions that tells us which operations to perform first.

The first operation in the order of operations is parentheses. We don't have any parentheses in this problem, so we can move on to the next operation, which is exponents.

We don't have any exponents in this problem either, so we can move on to the next operation, which is multiplication. In this problem, we have 3*2, so we need to multiply 3 and 2 first.

3*2 = 6

Now, we need to add 5 and 6.

5 + 6 = 11

So, the final answer is 11.

The answer is 11."
