systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In our problem, we have neither parentheses nor exponents. So, we move on to multiplication and division. We see a 3 being multiplied by 2. So, we do that operation first:

5 + 3 * 2
5 + 6

Now, we are left with addition. We add the 5 to the 6:

5 + 6
11

The answer is 11."
