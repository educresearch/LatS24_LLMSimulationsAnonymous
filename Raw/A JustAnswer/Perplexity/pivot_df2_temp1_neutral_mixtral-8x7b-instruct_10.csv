mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Let's solve this expression by following the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This order is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.

Given expression: 4*(2+5) + 12 - 2*3

First, perform the operation inside the parentheses:

4*7 + 12 - 2*3

Then, perform multiplication:

28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, do addition and subtraction from left to right:

40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we evaluate the expression in the parentheses:

4 * (2 + 5) = 4 * 7 = 28

So the original expression becomes:

28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we do the multiplication:

28 + 12 - 6

Finally, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, solve the operation in the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7

Now the equation looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, do any multiplication or division from left to right: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6, so the equation becomes: 28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, do addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40 and 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, according to PEMDAS, we need to do whatever is inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5.

2 + 5 = 7

So now our equation looks like this:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we do any multiplication or division from left to right. We have two such operations: 4 * 7 and 2 * 3. 

4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6

So now our equation looks like this:

28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, we do addition and subtraction from left to right. We have three such operations now: 28, 12, and -6.

Adding 28 and 12 gives us 40. Then subtracting 6 from 40 gives us 34.

Therefore,

The answer is 34."
