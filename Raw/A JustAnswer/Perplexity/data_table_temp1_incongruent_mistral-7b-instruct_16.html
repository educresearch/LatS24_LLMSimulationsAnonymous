Now replace the parentheses with the number 7: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br>3. Next, we have multiplication and division: Perform them in the order they appear from left to right. We have 4 * 7 and 2 * 3:<br>   4 * 7 = 28<br>   2 * 3 = 6<br>4. Now we have addition and subtraction: Perform them in the order they appear from left to right.

      <td>GPT Response: The answer to this problem is not as straightforward as it may seem due to the order of operations, also known as BIDMAS or PEMDAS rule.
