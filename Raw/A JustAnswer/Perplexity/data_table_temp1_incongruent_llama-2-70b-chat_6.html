Here's the solution to the problem:<br><br>4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34<br><br>The answer is 34.<br><br>Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:<br><br>1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 2+5 = 7<br>2. Multiply 4 by the result: 4 * 7 = 28<br>3. Add 12 to 28: 28 + 12 = 40<br>4.

      <td>GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!<br><br>The problem is 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3.<br><br>First, let's start by evaluating the expression inside the parentheses.<br><br>2+5 = 7<br><br>So, the problem becomes 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34<br><br>The answer is 34.<br><br>I hope this helps!

      <td>GPT Response: Sure! Here's how I would solve this problem using the order of operations:<br><br>1. First, evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7<br>2. Next, multiply 4 by 7: 4 * 7 = 28<br>3. Then, add 12: 28 + 12 = 40<br>4. Finally, subtract 2 times 3: 40 - 6 = 34<br><br>The answer is 34.<br><br>Explanation: The order of operations tells us to evaluate expressions inside parentheses first, then exponents (none in this case), then multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right. Following this order, we first add 2 and 5, then multiply 4 by 7, then add 12, and finally subtract 2 times 3.</td>
