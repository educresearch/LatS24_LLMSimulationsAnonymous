mistral-7b-instruct,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Let's solve the expression step by step following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):

1. Parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7
2. Exponents: None present
3. Multiplication and Division: 4 * 7 = 28, 2 * 3 = 6
4. Addition and Subtraction: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Now, perform the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
Then, perform the subtraction:
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this expression, we need to follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, solve the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.

Next, perform multiplication and division: 4 * 7 = 28

Lastly, do addition and subtraction: 28 + 12 = 40, 40 - 2 * 3 = 38 (since 2 * 3 = 6, and 40 - 6 = 38).

The answer is: The answer is 38.","GPT Response: To solve the given expression, we need to follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction).

First, we will deal with the parentheses:

4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3

= 4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we will perform the operation inside the parentheses:

= 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Now we will perform the multiplication and division (from left to right):

= 28 + 12 - 2 * 3

= 28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, we will perform the addition and subtraction (from left to right):

= 36 - 6

= 30

The answer is: 30.","GPT Response: To solve this equation, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction. This means that we should first do anything inside parentheses, then any exponentions, after that multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction.

So, let's apply this to our problem 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3:

1. Inside the parentheses, we add 2 and 5: 2 + 5 = 7.
2. Multiply 4 by the result of the addition: 4 * 7 = 28.
3. Now we have to deal with two multiplication operations, so we perform the first one: 28 * 12 = 336.
4. Lastly, we subtract 2 * 3 from the result: 336 - (2 * 3) = 330.

So, the answer is: The answer is 330."
