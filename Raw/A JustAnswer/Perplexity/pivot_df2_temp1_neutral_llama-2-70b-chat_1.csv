llama-2-70b-chat,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's how we can solve this problem step by step:

1. Evaluate the expression within the parentheses: 2+5 = 7
2. Multiply 4 by 7: 4*7 = 28
3. Add 12: 28 + 12 = 40
4. Subtract 2 times 3: 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

The given problem is:

4*(2+5)+12-2*3

First, let's start by evaluating the expression inside the parentheses:

4*(2+5) = 4*7 = 28

Now, let's add 12:

28 + 12 = 40

Finally, let's subtract 2 times 3:

40 - 6 = 34

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:

1. Parentheses (if there are any)
2. Exponents (if there are any)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply this order to the given expression:

4*(2+5)+12-2*3

Step 1: Parentheses
There are no parentheses in this expression, so we can move on to the next step.

Step 2: Exponents
There are no exponents in this expression, so we can move on to the next step.

Step 3: Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
We have 4*2+5, which we can simplify as 4*7 = 28.

Step 4: Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)
We have 28 + 12 = 40.

Step 5: Final answer
The answer is 40.

So, the final answer is 40.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's how I would solve the problem:

First, I would follow the order of operations, which is PEMDAS:

1. Parentheses: inside the parentheses we have 2+5 = 7
