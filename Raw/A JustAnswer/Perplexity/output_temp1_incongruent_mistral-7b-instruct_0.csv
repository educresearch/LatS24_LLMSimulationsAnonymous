1. Parentheses: Solve the expression inside the parentheses first.
   2 + 5 = 7

2. Multiplication and Division (left to right): Perform any multiplication or division in order from left to right.
   We don't have any multiplication or division in this step, so we'll move on to the next step.

3. Addition and Subtraction (left to right): Perform any addition or subtraction in order from left to right.

   First, let's do the multiplication:
   procede with 4 * 7 = 28

   Now, do the subtraction:
   subtract 2 * 3 = 6

   Lastly, add the numbers:
   28 + 12 = 40

   The answer is __.
   The answer is 40."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this problem, we don't have any parentheses or exponents, so we'll move on to the next rule: Multiplication and Division.

Here, we have the multiplication operation: 3 * 2. We'll perform this first:

3 * 2 = 6

Now, we are left with the addition operation: 5 + 6. According to the order of operations, we'll perform the addition last:

5 + 6 = 11

So, the answer is:
The answer is 11."
