Let's solve the given expression step by step using PEMDAS:

Step 1: Parentheses
In our expression, there are no parentheses, so we move on to the next step.

Step 2: Exponents
There are no exponents in our expression, so let's move on to the next step.

Step 3: Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
We have two multiplication operations: 1) 4*(2+5) and 2) 2*3

We cannot do multiplication before addition and subtraction but we can do multiplication from left to right, so we will do the first multiplication operation (4 * (2+5)).

First, we perform the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7

So, 4*(2+5) = 28.

There is only one more multiplication operation left: 2*3 = 6.

Step 4: Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)
We have one addition operation (2+5) and one subtraction operation (-2*3).

Addition: We have already calculated this step in the multiplication step when we did 4*(2+5), so the result 28 does not change.

Subtraction: We subtract 2 from the result of the previous step, which was 28: 28 - 2 = 26

Step 5: The final answer
So, the answer is: The answer is 26."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the equation 5 + 3 * 2, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this equation, we do not have any parentheses or exponents. However, we do have multiplication (3 * 2) and addition (5 +).

Since multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations, we should first perform the multiplication.

So, we calculate 3 * 2, which equals 6.

Now we replace the multiplication in the original equation with the result (3 * 2 = 6), and we have:

5 + 6

Next, we perform the addition:

1 + 6 = 7

So, the answer is:

The answer is 7."
