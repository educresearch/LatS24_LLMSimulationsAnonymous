In the given problem, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we move on to the next steps:

1. Multiplication and Division: In the given problem, there is only one multiplication operation (3*2). We perform it by multiplying the numbers: 3 multiplied by 2 equals 6.
   
2. Addition and Subtraction: In the given problem, there are only addition operations. We perform them from left to right: we add 5 to the result of the multiplication operation (6). So, 5 + 6 equals 11.

The answer is: __

The answer is 11."
