mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: The answer to this problem is not as straightforward as it may seem due to the order of operations, also known as BIDMAS or PEMDAS rule. According to this rule, we should perform the multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. So, in this case, we have the multiplication of 2 and 4, which results in 8. Then we add 5 to the product, which gives us the answer:

The answer is 5 + 2 * 4 = 11. (but it is actually 8 + 5 = 13, I apologize for an error in my previous response)"

In this problem, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we'll start with multiplication and division.

Multiplication: There's only one multiplication operation (3 * 2), so we'll do that first.
3 * 2 = 6

Now, we'll tackle the addition part of the equation (5 + 6).

Addition: There are two addition operations (5 + 3 and 3 * 2 = 6), but due to the order of operations, we'll add the numbers that don't include the * first (5 + 3).

Addition: 5 + 3 = 8

Finally, to get the answer, we'll add the result of the multiplication (6) to the sum of the original additions (8).

The answer is 14."
