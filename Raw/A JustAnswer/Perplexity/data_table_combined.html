      <td>GPT Response: This problem involves the distributive property, also known as the multiplication property of addition, which allows us to distribute multiplication over addition or subtraction. In this case, we want to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (also from left to right), a rule often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.<br><br>Here's how to apply the distributive property step-by-step to solve the expression 5 + 3*2:<br><br>1. According to PEMDAS, since there are no parentheses or exponents, we proceed to the next step: Multiplication.<br><br>2. Apply the distributive property: 5 + 3*2 = 5 + 3*2 + 0 (add 0 to both sides to get a common term, *2, for the distribution)<br><br>3. Now distribute the multiplication term 3 over each addition term: <br><br>   5 + 3*2 = 5 + 3*2 + 0<br>          = 5 + 3*2 + 0<br>          = 5 + 3*2 + 0<br>          = 5 + 3*2 + 0<br><br>4.
