mistral-7b-instruct,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we handle the parentheses:
4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3

Now, perform the operation inside the parentheses:
4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, do the multiplication:
28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Now, perform the division and exponents (since there are none in this expression):
28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, do the addition and subtraction from left to right:
39 - 6 = 33

So, the answer is:

The answer is 33.","GPT Response: To solve this expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this expression, we have parentheses (2+5), so we'll start by doing that calculation:

4*(2+5)+12-2*3

4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3

Now we have multiplication (4 * 7) and subtraction (-2 * 3) in the expression, so we'll do those next:

28 + 12 - 6

Finally, we have addition and subtraction left, so we'll do those from left to right:

40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we need to calculate what's inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

Next, we do the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28

Now, we subtract:
28 + 12 = 40

Lastly, we do the last multiplication and subtraction:
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

So, the answer is:

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we need to follow the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

1. Solve the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.
2. Multiply the result by 4: 4 * 7 = 28.
3. Add 12 to the result: 28 + 12 = 40.
4. Next, do the multiplication: 2 * 3 = 6.
5. Subtract 2 from the result: 6 - 2 = 4.

So, the answer is:

The answer is 40. (However, if we were to follow the complete PEMDAS rule, we should do the subtraction before the addition. But, since there is no subtraction inside parentheses, it doesn't affect the final answer.)

This problem demonstrates that parentheses have the highest priority, followed by multiplication and division, and last comes addition and subtraction."
