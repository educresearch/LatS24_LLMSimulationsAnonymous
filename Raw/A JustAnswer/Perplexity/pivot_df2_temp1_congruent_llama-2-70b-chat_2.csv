The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:

1. Parentheses (if there are any)
2. Exponents (such as squaring or cubing)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

In the expression 5 + 3*2, we have multiplication and addition. Let's follow the order of operations to evaluate this expression:

1. Multiplication: 3*2 = 6
2. Addition: 5 + 6 = 11

Therefore, the final answer is 11.

To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations is like a set of instructions that tells us which operations to perform first. The acronym for the order of operations is PEMDAS:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply this order to our problem:

1. Parentheses: None
2. Exponents: None
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right): We have two multiplication operations: 7*2 and 8*5. We perform these operations from left to right, so we multiply 7 and 2 first, and then multiply 8 and 5.
7*2 = 14
8*5 = 40
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right): We add 14 and 40.
14 + 40 = 54

Therefore, the answer is 54.

So, the final answer is: The answer is 54."
