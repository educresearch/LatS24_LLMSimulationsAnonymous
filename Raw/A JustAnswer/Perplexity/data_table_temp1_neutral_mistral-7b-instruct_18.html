      <td>GPT Response: The order of operations, also known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction), tells us the sequence in which we should perform mathematical operations.

In this case, we have multiplication (4*3).<br><br>So, first, we multiply 4 and 3, which equals 12. Now we have 12 and 2 left for the addition operation (since addition is the last rule to follow according to the order of operations).<br><br>Therefore, the final answer is:<br><br>The answer is 12+2.<br><br>But, before you add 12 and 2, recall that no matter how many zeros you add at the end of a number, it doesn't change the value. As a result, you don't need to carry out multi-digit multiplication within a single digit multiplication; instead, you can directly perform the addition.<br><br>So, let's perform the addition:<br><br>The answer is 12+2 = 14.</td>
