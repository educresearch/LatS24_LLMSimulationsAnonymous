5 + 3*2 = 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.

Explanation:

In this problem, we have a simple expression with two operations: addition and multiplication. The multiplication operation happens first, so we need to calculate 3*2 before adding 5 to it. 3*2 is equal to 6, so the final result is 5 + 6 = 11."

llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help!

The order of operations tells us to follow these steps:

1. Parentheses (if there are any)
2. Exponents (if there are any)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply this to the problem 5+3*2:

1. There are no parentheses, so we can skip to the next step.
2. There are no exponents, so we can skip to the next step.
3. We see that there is a multiplication symbol (*) before the 2. We need to follow the multiplication from left to right, so we multiply 3 and 2 first: 3*2 = 6.
4. Now we add 5 and 6: 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to explain my solution to this problem!

The first step in solving this problem is to follow the order of operations. The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS helps us remember the order:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

So, let's apply this order to our problem:

5 + 2 * 4

First, we need to multiply 2 and 4, which gives us 8. Now we have:

5 + 8

Next, we need to add 5 and 8, which gives us 13.

So, the answer is 13.

When solving the problem 7*2+8*5, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us which operations to perform first. The acronym for the order of operations is PEMDAS:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply the order of operations to our problem:

1. Parentheses: None
2. Exponents: None
3. Multiplication and Division: We have two multiplication operations: 7*2 and 8*5. We perform these operations from left to right, so we multiply 7 and 2 first, and then multiply 8 and 5.
7*2 = 14
8*5 = 40
4. Addition and Subtraction: Now, we add 14 and 40.
14 + 40 = 54

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 54."
