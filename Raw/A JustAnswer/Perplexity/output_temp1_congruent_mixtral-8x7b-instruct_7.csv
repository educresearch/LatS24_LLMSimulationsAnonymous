Finally, we have Addition and Subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40, so the problem becomes: 40 - 6.

And, when we subtract 6 from 40, we get:

The answer is 34."

In this problem, we have neither parentheses nor exponents, so we go straight to multiplication. We see the 3 and the 2 multiplied together first.

5 + 3*2 = 5 + 6

Then we do addition. We see the 5 and the result of the multiplication operation, 6.

5 + 6 = 11

So,

The answer is 11."
