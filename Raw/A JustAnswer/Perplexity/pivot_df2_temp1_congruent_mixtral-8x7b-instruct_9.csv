mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Let's solve this expression step by step, following the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.

Given expression: 4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3

First, perform the operation inside the parentheses:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, do the multiplication:

28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, do addition and subtraction from left to right:

40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we do the operation inside the parentheses:

4 * (7) + 12 - 2*3

Then, we do multiplication:

28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, we do addition and subtraction from left to right:

40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, according to PEMDAS, we need to do the operation in the parentheses, which is addition in this case:

4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3
= 4 * 7 + 12 - 2*3

Next, we have multiplication:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2*3
= 28 + 12 - 6

Then, addition:

28 + 12 - 6
= 40 - 6

Finally, subtraction:

40 - 6
= 34

So,

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure! The mathematical expression you've given me is: 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3

To solve this, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, according to PEMDAS, we need to solve the operation inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5. Adding those two numbers together gives us 7.

So now our equation looks like this: 4*(7) + 12 - 2*3

Next, we move on to Multiplication and Division from left to right. We have two multiplication operations, so we start with the one on the left: 4*7. Multiplying those two numbers together gives us 28.

So now our equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2*3

Now we move on to Addition and Subtraction from left to right. We have addition and subtraction, so we start with the addition: 28 + 12. Adding those two numbers together gives us 40.

So now our equation looks like this: 40 - 2*3

Next, we do the remaining Multiplication: 2*3. Multiplying those two numbers together gives us 6.

So now our equation looks like this: 40 - 6

Finally, we move on to the last operation, which is Subtraction. Subtracting 6 from 40 gives us 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34."
