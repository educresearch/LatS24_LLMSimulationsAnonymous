mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this expression, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, solve the operation inside the parentheses:
4 * (2 + 5) = 4 * 7 = 28

Then, the expression becomes:
28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, do multiplication:
28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, do addition and subtraction from left to right:
40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7

So, the original expression becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we perform multiplication and division from left to right: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6, so the expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, we do addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40 and 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, according to PEMDAS, we need to solve the operation in the parentheses, which is 2 + 5.
So, 2 + 5 equals 7.

Now our equation looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we have multiplication and division from left to right.  So, we first solve 4 * 7, which equals 28.
