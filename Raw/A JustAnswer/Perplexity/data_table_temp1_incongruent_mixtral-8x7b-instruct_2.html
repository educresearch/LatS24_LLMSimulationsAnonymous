      <td>GPT Response: Let's solve this step by step using the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction).<br><br>1. Parentheses: We start by solving the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.<br>2. Multiplication and Division: Next, we do any multiplication and division from left to right. We have two multiplication operations: 4 * 7 (from the first multiplication sign) and 2 * 3. Calculate 4 * 7 first, which equals 28. Keep 2 * 3 for later.<br>3. Addition and Subtraction: Lastly, do addition and subtraction from left to right. We have the addition 4 * 7 + 12, which equals 36, and the subtraction 36 - 2 * 3. Before moving on to addition, perform the remaining multiplication: 2 * 3 equals 6. Now, subtract that from the previous result: 36 - 6, which equals 30.<br><br>The answer is 30.</td>
