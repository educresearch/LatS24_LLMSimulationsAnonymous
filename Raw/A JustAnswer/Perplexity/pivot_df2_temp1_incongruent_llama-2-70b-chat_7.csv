llama-2-70b-chat,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Sure! Here's how to solve the problem:

= 4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3
= 4 * 7 + 12 - 6
= 28 + 12 - 6
= 44

So, the answer is 44.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's how we can solve the problem:

First, let's start by evaluating the expression inside the parentheses. We have:

2 + 5 = 7

So, the expression inside the parentheses is equal to 7.

Next, we can multiply 4 by 7:

4 * 7 = 28

Now, we add 12 to 28:

28 + 12 = 40

Finally, we subtract 2 times 3 from 40:

40 - 6 = 34

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure! Here's how I would solve this problem using the order of operations:

1. First, I would evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 2+5 = 7
2. Next, I would multiply 4 by 7: 4 * 7 = 28
3. Then, I would add 12: 28 + 12 = 40
4. Finally, I would subtract 2 times 3: 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

The problem is 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Sure! Here's how to solve the problem:

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Sure, I can help you with that!

The order of operations tells us to follow these steps when evaluating an expression:

1. Parentheses (if there are any)
2. Exponents (if there are any)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

So, let's apply this to our expression: 4 * 3+2.

First, we multiply 4 and 3, which gives us 12.

Next, we add 2 to 12, which gives us 14.

Therefore, the answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

The answer is 13.

I hope this explanation helps you understand how to solve the problem using the order of operations!","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to explain my solution to the problem!

The first step in solving this problem is to follow the order of operations. The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS helps us remember the order:

1. Parentheses (if there are any)
2. Exponents (if there are any)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

In this problem, we have both multiplication and addition, so we need to follow the order of operations.

First, we multiply 2 by 4:

2 Ã— 4 = 8

Next, we add 5 and 8:

5 + 8 = 13

So, the final answer is:
