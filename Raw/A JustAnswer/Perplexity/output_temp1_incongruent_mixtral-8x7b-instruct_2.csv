In this problem, we have neither parentheses nor exponents, so we move to the next step in PEMDAS which is Multiplication and Division. We see the number 3 being multiplied by 2. So we perform that operation first:

5 + 6

Now, we are left with addition. We add the number 5 to 6:

11

The answer is 11."
