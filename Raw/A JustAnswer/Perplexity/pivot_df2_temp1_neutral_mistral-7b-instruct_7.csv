mistral-7b-instruct,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this expression, follow the order of operations which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Given expression: 4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3

First, solve the expression inside the parentheses:

2 + 5 = 7

Now, perform multiplication and division from left to right:

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Next, do the addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So, the answer is:

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 4*(2+5)+12-2*3, we need to follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).

First, let's take care of the parentheses: 
4*{2+5} + 12 - 2*3 

Next, do the operations inside the parentheses:
4*{7} + 12 - 2*3 

Now, perform multiplication and division:
4*7 + 12 - 2*3

Because we are supposed to do multiplication and division from left to right, we need to first do the multiplication part:
28 + 12 - 2*3

Then, do subtraction: 
28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, perform addition:
40 - 6

The answer is __.
40 - 6 = 34.","GPT Response: The order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), tells us the sequence in which we should perform mathematical operations.

Given the expression 4*(2+5)+12-2*3, let's follow the order of operations to find the solution:

1. Parentheses: Solve the expression within the parentheses first. In this case, there are no parentheses.

2. Exponents: Since there are no exponents in our expression, we can move on to the next step.

3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right): We encounter the multiplication operations first and can perform them in this order: 
    a. 2 * 3 = 6
    b. In case we haven't done so, we would have performed 4 * (2 + 5) now, but since we are currently at the multiplication step and we have already done 2 * 3, we proceed to the next multiplication operation; 
    c. 4 * (2 + 5) = 4 * 7 = 28

4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right): We perform the operations in the order they appear, from left to right.

5. Addition: 28 + 12 = 40

6. Subtraction: 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve the problem 4*(2+5)+12-2*3, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we need to handle the parentheses:

4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3

Since there are no exponents, we can move on to multiplication and division:

4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3

Now, we perform multiplication:

28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we do addition and subtraction from left to right. In this problem, we only have subtraction. However, the subtraction sign (-) is considered the last operation in the Addition and Subtraction category, so we need to find the value of what's being subtracted first:

28 + 12 - 2 * 3

28 + 12 - 6

Finally, we perform the last operation, which is addition:

30 - 6

The answer is:

__

30 - 6 = 24. So the final answer is 24."
