Given expression: 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3

First, perform the operation inside the parentheses:

4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3

Now, do the addition inside the parentheses:

4 * (7) + 12 - 2*3

Perform the multiplication:

28 + 12 - 2*3

Now, do the multiplication outside the parentheses:

28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:

30 - 6 = 24

The answer is 24.","GPT Response: To solve this expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is commonly remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Let's apply this rule to the given expression:

1. Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5, which equals 7. So, the expression now becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

2. Then, we perform multiplication and division from left to right. We have 2 multiplications: 4 * 7 and 2 * 3. Perform the first multiplication: 28. Now, the expression looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3

3. Next, we add and subtract from left to right. We start with subtraction: 28 + 12 - 6 (since 2 * 3 equals 6). Now, we are left with addition: 34.

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: The order of operations, also known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), tells us the sequence in which to perform calculations.
