4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28

28 + 12 = 40

40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure! Here's how to solve the problem:

First, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Parentheses: inside the parentheses we have 2+5 = 7
2. Exponents (none in this case)
3. Multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28
4. Addition: 28 + 12 = 40
5. Subtraction: 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

The order of operations says that we need to follow these steps:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents (none in this case)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

So, let's start by evaluating what's inside the parentheses:

4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28

Next, we add 12:

28 + 12 = 40

Finally, we subtract 2 times 3:

40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

When we have multiple operations in an expression, we need to follow the Order of Operations to ensure we perform the operations in the correct order. The Order of Operations is often abbreviated as PEMDAS:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents (none in this case)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply PEMDAS to the expression 7 * 2 + 8 * 5:

1. Multiply 7 and 2: 7 * 2 = 14
2. Multiply 8 and 5: 8 * 5 = 40
3. Add 14 and 40: 14 + 40 = 54
