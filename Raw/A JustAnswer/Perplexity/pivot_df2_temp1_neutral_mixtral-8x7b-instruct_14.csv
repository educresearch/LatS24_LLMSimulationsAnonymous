mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this expression, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, according to the order of operations, we need to solve the expression within the parentheses:

4 * (7)

Then, we move on to multiplication:

4 * 7 = 28

So now our expression looks like this:

28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we perform the remaining multiplication:

2 * 3 = 6

So our expression becomes:

28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we should follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).
