systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this problem, we don't have any parentheses, exponents, or division, so we'll focus on multiplication and addition. According to the order of operations, we must do the multiplication before the addition.

So, in this problem, 3*2 is the multiplication part:
3 * 2 = 6

Now, we substitute 6 for the multiplication part in the original problem:
5 + 6

Finally, we perform addition:
5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11."
