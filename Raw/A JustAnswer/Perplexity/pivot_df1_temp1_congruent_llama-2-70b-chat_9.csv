llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

The problem is 5 + 3*2.

First, we need to follow the order of operations, which is PEMDAS:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

In this case, we have parentheses, so we need to evaluate what's inside the parentheses first.

Inside the parentheses we have 3*2 = 6

Now, we can proceed to the next step, which is addition and subtraction from left to right.

5 + 6 = 11

So, the final answer is 11.

The answer is 11."
