      <td>GPT Response: Sure! Here's the step-by-step solution to the problem:<br><br>1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 2+5 = 7<br>2. Multiply 4 by 7: 4*7 = 28<br>3. Add 12: 28 + 12 = 40<br>4. Subtract 2 times 3: 40 - 6 = 34<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's how to solve the problem:<br><br>First, let's start by evaluating the expression inside the parentheses:<br><br>4*(2+5) = 4*7 = 28<br><br>Next, we add 12:<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>Finally, we subtract 2 times 3:<br><br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So, the final answer is:<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Sure! Here's how I would solve the problem using the order of operations:<br><br>1. First, follow the parentheses: inside the parentheses we have 2+5 = 7<br>2. Next, multiply 4 by 7 = 28<br>3. Then, add 12 = 40<br>4. Finally, subtract 2 times 3 = 38<br><br>The answer is 38.<br><br>Explanation:<br><br>The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:<br><br>P - parentheses (evaluate expressions inside parentheses first)<br>E - exponents (none in this case)<br>M - multiplication (evaluate multiplication next)<br>D - division (none in this case)<br>A - addition (evaluate addition next)<br>S - subtraction (evaluate subtraction last)<br><br>By following this order, we can ensure that we perform calculations correctly and avoid confusion. In this problem, we first evaluate the expression inside the parentheses (2+5), then multiply 4 by 7, then add 12, and finally subtract 2 times 3.</td>
