systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: Sure! The Mathematics problem you've given is: 4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3

To solve this, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, according to PEMDAS, we need to solve the expression in Parentheses, which is (2 + 5). Adding those numbers together gives us 7.

So the expression now looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we deal with Multiplication and Division from left to right. We have two multiplication operations: 4 * 7 and 2 * 3. Let's do them one at a time.

4 * 7 equals 28, so the expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Then, 2 * 3 equals 6, so the expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 6

Now, we're down to Addition and Subtraction from left to right. We add 28 and 12 together first, which gives us 40.

So the expression becomes: 40 - 6

Finally, we Subtract 6 from 40, which gives us 34.

The answer is 34."

In our problem, we have addition and multiplication. According to PEMDAS, we should do multiplication before addition.

So first, let's do the multiplication: 3 * 2 = 6

Now, replace the multiplication part of the equation with the result: 5 + 6

Finally, do the addition: 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11."
