4. Add 12 and 28: 40
5. Subtract 6 from 40: 34

The answer is: The answer is 34."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: The order of operations in mathematics is commonly remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). Here's how we apply it to the given expression 5 + 3*2:

1. Identify any expressions within Parentheses, if there were any. Since there are none in this problem, we move to the next step.
2. Check for Exponents. There are no exponents present, so we proceed.
3. Perform Multiplication and Division (from left to right). In this problem, we only have the multiplication operation: 3*2. So, we perform this multiplication first:

3 * 2 = 6

4. Now we have 5 + 6. This is still Addition and Subtraction, so we perform it last:

5 + 6 = 11

The answer is __.
The answer is 11."
