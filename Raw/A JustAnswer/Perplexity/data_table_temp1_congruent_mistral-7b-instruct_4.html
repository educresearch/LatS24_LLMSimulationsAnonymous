      <td>GPT Response: To solve the expression 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3, we need to follow the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction). Let's apply PEMDAS step by step:<br><br>1. First, we deal with any numbers inside parentheses. We have 2 + 5, which equals 7. Now the expression looks like 4*7 + 12 - 2*3.<br>2. Next, we perform any multiplication and division, working from left to right. We have 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6. Now the expression looks like 28 + 12 - 6.<br>3. Finally, we perform any addition and subtraction, again working from left to right. We add 12 and 28, which equals 40. Then we subtract 6, leaving us with 34 as the final answer.<br><br>So, The answer is 34.</td>
