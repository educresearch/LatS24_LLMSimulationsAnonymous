Now, we add 14 to 40.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n__\n14 + 40 = 54\n\nSo, the final answer is: The answer is 54."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt3_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500", "model": "mistral-7b-instruct", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 500, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in grade 6 learning order of operations for the first time.\n                    Explain your solution to this given Mathematics problem, and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "4 * 3+2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nFirst, we don't have any parentheses, exponents, or multiplication to deal with, so let's move on to the addition:\n\n4 * 3 + 2\n\nSince we don't have multiplication before this addition, we can just perform the multiplication first:\n\n12 (4 * 3) + 2\n\nNow we have multiplication, so we apply it:\n\n12 (12) + 2\n\nNow we have two 12s in a row, so we have multiplied 4 and 3 as if it were one number times the other (12), so we should write it as:\n\n12 * 1 + 2\n\nNow, there is only one multiplication left, so we perform it:\n\n14\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nThe answer is 14."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500", "model": "mistral-7b-instruct", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 500, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in grade 6 learning order of operations for the first time.\n                    Explain your solution to this given Mathematics problem, and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nFirst, let's deal with the parentheses:\n\n4 * (2+5)\n juniour: This part is inside the parentheses so we need to do the addition first: 2 + 5 = 7\nNow, we have: 4 * 7\n\nNext, we follow the order of operations and do the multiplication:\n\n4 * 7 = 28\n\nThen, we move on to the next operation inside the parentheses, but since there is no addition or subtraction inside it, we skip this step for now. \n\nNow, let's deal with the rest of the equation:\n\n28 + 12 - 2 * 3\n\nSince there are no parentheses or exponents in this part, we do addition and subtraction from left to right.\n\nFirst, we subtract:\n\n28 + 12 - 2 * 3\n28 + 12 - 6\n\nNow, we add:\n\n30 - 6 = 24\n\nThe answer is: The answer is 24."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500", "model": "mistral-7b-instruct", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 500, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in grade 6 learning order of operations for the first time.\n                    Explain your solution to this given Mathematics problem, and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "5+3 * 2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: The order of operations in mathematics is commonly remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nIn the problem 5 + 3 * 2, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we move on to the next order of operations: multiplication and division.\n\nHere's how we solve it step by step according to the order of operations:\n\n1.
