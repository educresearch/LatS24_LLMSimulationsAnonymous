1. First, we need to do the calculation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.
2. Then, we multiply: 4 * 7 = 28.
3. Next, we do the multiplication and division from left to right: 12 - 2 * 3. Since we need to do multiplication and division before addition and subtraction, we'll first calculate 2 * 3 = 6, and then subtract it from 12: 12 - 6 = 6.
4. Last, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right. Since there is only one subtraction, we perform it: The answer is 28 - 2 = 26.

So, the answer is: 
The answer is 26."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this problem, we do not have any parentheses, exponents, or division, so we will begin with multiplication. Namely, 3 multiplied by 2 equals 6. So the problem now looks like this: 5 + 6.

Next, we perform addition. Adding 5 and 6, we get 11. Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 11."
