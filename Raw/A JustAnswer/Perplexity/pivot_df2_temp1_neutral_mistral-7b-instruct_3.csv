mistral-7b-instruct,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 4*(2+5)+12-2*3, we need to follow the order of operations, which is commonly represented by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (also from left to right).

First, we need to deal with the parentheses:

4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3

Now, calculate the expression inside the parentheses:

4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, perform the multiplication:

28 + 12 - 2 * 3

In this expression, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we'll move on to multiplication and addition.

Multiplication comes before addition, so we perform it first: 2 * 4 = 8. Now our expression looks like this: 5 + 8.

Perform addition next: 5 + 8 = 13.

So, the answer is: The answer is 13.","GPT Response: The solution to this mathematical expression involves using the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). In this case, we only have multiplication and addition, so the rule simplifies to performing multiplication before addition.

Applying this rule, we first multiply 2 and 4, getting an answer of 8. Next, we add 5 to this product, resulting in an answer of 13.

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: According to the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), you should perform the multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. In this problem, there is no exponent or division, but there is multiplication.

So, the first step would be to perform the multiplication: 2 * 4 = 8

Now, substitute the result back into the equation: 5 + 8

The next step is addition: 5 + 8 = 13
