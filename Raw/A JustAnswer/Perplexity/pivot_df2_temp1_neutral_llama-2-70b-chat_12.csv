3. Add 14 and 40: 14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.

Explanation:
The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:

P - parentheses (evaluate expressions inside parentheses first)
E - exponents (evaluate expressions with exponents next)
M - multiplication (evaluate multiplication expressions next)
D - division (evaluate division expressions next)
A - addition (evaluate addition expressions last)
S - subtraction (evaluate subtraction expressions last)

In the given expression, we have multiplication and addition operations. We follow the order of operations and first multiply 7 and 2, then multiply 8 and 5. Next, we add 14 and 40 to get 54. Therefore, the answer is 54.","GPT Response: Sure! Here's how I would solve the problem:
