mistral-7b-instruct,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is commonly remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Let's apply this rule to your expression step by step:

1. First, we have the multiplication inside the parentheses: 2 * 3 = 6.
2. Next, we perform the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7. So the expression inside the parentheses is 7.
3. Now we have multiplication outside the parentheses: 4 * 7 = 28.
4. After that, we have another addition: 28 + 12 = 40.
5. Finally, we have subtraction: 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this expression, we follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we handle the parentheses:

In this expression, there are no parentheses or exponents. We do have multiplication and addition. Based on the order of operations, we should first perform the multiplication, then the addition:

1. Multiply 2 and 4: 2 * 4 = 8
2. Add 5 and 8: 5 + 8 = 13

However, in this simple case, the parentheses are not needed, and the problem can be solved using the order of operations, which is represented by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponent, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Given the expression 5 + 2*4, following the order of operations:

1. Since there are no parentheses, exponents, or multiplication/division inside them, we proceed with the addition and multiplication.

First, we perform the multiplication since the multiplication sign has a higher precedence (associativity from left to right) than addition: 2*4 = 8

2. Subsequently, we perform the addition: 5 + 8

The answer is __:
13.

Based on this rule, we should first do the multiplication operation, which is 2 multiplied by 4. That equals 8. Then we add 5 to the result. So the calculation would be:

5 + (2 * 4)
= 5 + (8)
= 5 + 8
= 13

The answer is: 13.","GPT Response: When we have an expression with addition and multiplication, we need to follow the order of operations which is commonly remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In the given expression 5 + 2 * 4, multiplication comes before addition according to the order of operations. So the first step is to do the multiplication:

In this expression, we have multiplication before addition. So the first step is to perform the multiplication:

3 * 2 = 6

Now, we have: 5 + 6

Next, we perform the addition:

5 + 6 = 11

The answer is:

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: To solve this expression, we need to apply the distributive property, also known as the FOIL rule when dealing with multiplication and addition. The term ""3*2"" needs to be distributed to the numbers being added as follows:

5 + 3*2

First, distribute the '3' to both '5' and '2':

5 + 3*2
5 + 3*2 equivalents: 5 + 3*2, 5 + 3*2, 5 + 3*2, 5 + 3*2, 5 + 3*2

Now replace each instance with 3*(number being added):
5 + 3*2
5 + 3*2 equivalents: 5 + 3*2, 5 + 3*2, 5 + 3*2, 5 + 3*2, 5 + 3*2
5 + 3*2, 5 + 3*2: 5 + 3*2, 5 + 3*2, 5 + 3*2, 5 + 3*2, 5 + 3*2
5 + 3*2, 5 + 3*2, 5 + 3*2, 5 + 3*2: 5 + 3*2, 5 + 3*2, 5 + 3*2, 5 + 3*2, 5 + 3*2, 5 + 3*2

So now each '+' sign is associated with a particular multiplication:
5 + 3*2 equals 5 + 3 * 2

To proceed, we apply the distributive property:

5 + 3 * 2
5 + 3 * 2 equals 5 + 3*2, 5 + 3*2: 5 + 3*2, 5 + 3*2

Given there are two cases for the distribution we had applied, we will now calculate each pair of multiplication and addition independently:
