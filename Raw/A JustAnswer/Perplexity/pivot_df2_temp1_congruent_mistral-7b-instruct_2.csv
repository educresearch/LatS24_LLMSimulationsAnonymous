Given expression: 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3

First, perform the operation inside the parentheses:

4* (2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3

Next, do the addition inside the parentheses:

4* (7) + 12 - 2*3

Now, perform multiplication:

28 + 12 - 2*3

Then, calculate the remaining multiplication:

28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, do the addition and subtraction from left to right:

30 - 6 = 24

So, the answer is:

The answer is 24.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we have parentheses. So, we will calculate the expression inside the parentheses: 

2 + 5 = 7

Now, 4 multiplied by 7: 

4 * 7 = 28

Next, we have an addition sign followed by a subtraction sign, so we will perform addition before subtraction. We added 28 to 12:

28 + 12 = 40

Lastly, we have a multiplication: 

2 * 3 = 6

Now, we subtract 6 from 40:

40 - 6 = 34

So, the answer is:
