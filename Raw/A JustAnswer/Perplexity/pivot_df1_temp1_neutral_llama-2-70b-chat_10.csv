llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Sure! Here's how I would solve this problem using the order of operations:

1. First, multiply 2 and 4: 2*4 = 8
2. Next, add 5 and 8: 5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.

Explanation:
The order of operations tells us to perform operations inside parentheses (in this case, the multiplication) first, then move on to the next operation (in this case, the addition). So we multiply 2 and 4 to get 8, and then add 5 and 8 to get 13. That's why the final answer is 13."

llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's how we can solve this problem using the order of operations:

1. First, we need to follow the rule that says ""Parentheses come first."" In this case, we have parentheses around the 3*2 part of the equation.
2. Inside the parentheses, we multiply 3 and 2 to get 6.
3. Next, we need to follow the rule that says ""Exponents come next."" In this case, we don't have any exponents, so we can skip this step.
4. After that, we need to follow the rule that says ""Multiplication and Division come next."" In this case, we have a multiplication sign between the 5 and the 6, so we need to multiply them together.
5. Finally, we add the 5 and the 6 to get our final answer.

The answer is 11.

llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

The problem is 5+3*2.

First, we need to follow the order of operations, which is PEMDAS:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

In this case, we have parentheses, so we need to evaluate what's inside the parentheses first. Inside the parentheses we have 3*2.

We multiply 3 and 2 and get 6.

Now we need to add 5 and 6.

The answer is 11.

So, the final answer is: The answer is 11."
