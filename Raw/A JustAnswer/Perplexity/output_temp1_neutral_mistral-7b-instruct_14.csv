Let's apply this order of operations to the given problem: 4 *(2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3.

1. First, we follow the rule for parentheses. In this problem, there are no parentheses, so we move on to the next rule.

2. The next rule in PEMDAS is exponents. But we don't have any exponents in this problem. The next rule is Multiplication and Division.

3. Multiplication and Division: We have two multiplication sign, one inside and one outside the addition. We should do the one inside parentheses first because of the rule ""Multiplication and Division (from left to right)"". Let's compute that first:

  4 * (2+5) = 4 * (7)

4. Then we perform the multiplication outside the parentheses:

  = 4 * 7 = 28

5. Now, it's time for the addition and subtraction: We add and subtract from left to right. There is addition inside and outside parentheses. Let's compute it step by step:

  = 28 + 12 = 40

6. At last, we have only one remaining operation, which is subtraction. Let's perform this:

  = 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."

First, we need to take care of the multiplication: 3 * 2
Multiply 3 by 2: 3 x 2 = 6

Now, we add the result of the multiplication to the number outside the parentheses:
5 + 6

Add 5 and 6: 11

The answer is: The answer is 11."
