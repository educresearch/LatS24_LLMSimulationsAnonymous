mistral-7b-instruct,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, we follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Step 1: Solve the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.

Step 2: Replace the parentheses with the result, 7: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Step 3: Perform multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28; 2 * 3 = 6.

Step 4: Replace the multiplications with the results: 28 + 12 - 6.

Step 5: Perform addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40; 40 - 6 = 34.

Answer: The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this expression, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we move on to the next steps.

First, perform multiplication and division:
4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3

Since there is only one multiplication in this expression, and it is inside the parentheses, we will distribute the multiplication operation first:

4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3
4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3

Now, compute the value inside the parentheses:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, do the remaining multiplication:

28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Now, perform addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 - 2 * 3
40 - 2 * 3

Then, complete the subtraction:

38 - 2 * 3

Lastly, perform the remaining multiplication:

38 - 6

So, the answer is:

The answer is 32. (Note: Depending on the specific mathematical context, rounding or truncation might be required. However, given the problem statement as provided, the final answer remains 32.)","GPT Response: First, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Since there are parentheses in this problem, let's start there:

1. Solve the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.
2. Replace the parentheses with the number 7: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, we have multiplication:

1. Multiply 4 and 7: 28.
2. Multiply 2 and 3: 6.
3. Replace the multiplication symbols with the numbers: 28 + 12 - 6.

Now, we have addition and subtraction:

1. Add the numbers on the left side: 28 + 12 = 40.
2. Subtract the number on the right side from the answer: 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is: The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we have parentheses:
4*(2 + 5)

Since the parentheses contain an addition operation, we follow the order ofoperations inside the parentheses first, that is, we do the addition:
4*(2 + 5)
 = 4*(7)

Now, we have a multiplication inside the parentheses, so we do that next:
4*(7)
 = 4*7
 = 28

So, the first part of our solution is 28. Now, we need to do the remaining parts of the problem:

28 + 12 - 2*3

The first operation is addition:
28 + 12
 = 40

Next, we have subtraction:
40 - 2*3

Since we're subtracting the product of 2 and 3, we need to do the multiplication first:
40 - 2*3
 = 40 - 6

Finally, we have the answer:
