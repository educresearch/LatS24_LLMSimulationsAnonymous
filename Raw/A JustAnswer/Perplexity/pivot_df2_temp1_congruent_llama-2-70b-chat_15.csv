The order of operations tells us to follow these steps:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents (none in this case)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

So, let's start by evaluating the expression inside the parentheses:

4*(2 + 5) = 4*7 = 28

Now, we can move on to the next step:

28 + 12 = 40

Finally, we subtract 2 times 3:

40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure! Here's how I would solve the problem using the order of operations:

1. First, I would evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7
2. Next, I would multiply 4 by 7: 4 * 7 = 28
3. Then, I would add 12: 28 + 12 = 40
4. Finally, I would subtract 2 times 3: 40 - 6 = 34

Therefore, the answer is 11.

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

The problem we're given is 5 + 3*2. To solve this, we need to follow the order of operations, which is PEMDAS: parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction.

First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses, which is 3*2. We multiply 3 and 2 to get 6.

So, the equation becomes 5 + 6. We add 5 and 6 to get 11.

Therefore, the answer is 11.

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Sure, I can help you with that!

The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply this order to the expression 5 + 3*2:

1. First, we multiply 3 and 2: 3*2 = 6
2. Next, we add 5 and 6: 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.

So, the final answer is 11.","GPT Response: Sure! Here's how I would solve the problem:

First, I would multiply 3 and 2, since multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations:

3*2 = 6

Now, I would add 5 and 6:

5 + 6 = 11

Therefore, the final answer is 11.
