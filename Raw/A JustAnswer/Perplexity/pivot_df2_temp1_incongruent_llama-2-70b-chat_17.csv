llama-2-70b-chat,1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Sure! To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Multiply 4 and 3: 4 * 3 = 12
2. Add 2: 12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Sure! Here's how we can evaluate this expression:

4 * 3 = 12

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Sure! Here's how I would solve this problem using the order of operations:

1. Multiply 4 and 3: 4 * 3 = 12
2. Add 2 to 12: 12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.

Explanation:
The order of operations tells us to perform multiplication before addition. So, we first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then, we add 2 to 12 to get 14. That's our final answer!","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

The problem is 4 * 3 + 2.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Sure! Here's how to solve the problem 5+2 * 4:

1. First, we need to follow the order of operations, which is PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and then Addition and Subtraction.
2. In this case, we have a multiplication before the addition, so we need to evaluate the multiplication first.
3. 2 * 4 = 8
4. Now, we add 5 and 8: 5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.

The problem is 5 + 2 * 4.

First, we need to follow the order of operations:

1. Parentheses: None
2. Exponents (none in this case)
3. Multiplication: 2 * 4 = 8
4. Addition: 5 + 8 = 13

Therefore, the answer is 13.

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to explain my solution to this problem!

The first thing we need to do is follow the order of operations. This means we need to do anything that is inside parentheses first, then do any exponents (like squaring or cubing), then do multiplication and division from left to right, and finally do addition and subtraction from left to right.

In this problem, we have parentheses, so we need to do what's inside them first. Inside the parentheses we have 2 * 4, which means we need to multiply 2 and 4.

2 * 4 = 8

Now we have our answer to the stuff inside the parentheses, so we can move on to the next step. We need to do any exponents, but we don't have any in this problem.

Next, we need to do any multiplication and division from left to right. We have 5 + 8, which means we need to add 5 and 8.

5 + 8 = 13

Finally, we have our answer! The answer is 13.

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 13."
