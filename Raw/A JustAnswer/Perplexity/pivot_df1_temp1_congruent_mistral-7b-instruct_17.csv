mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: The answer to this problem is found by applying the distributive property, which states that you can multiply each term in a sum by the same number.

First, we need to follow the order of operations, which includes parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). Since there are no parentheses or exponents in this expression, we start with multiplication.

Here's how it works:

1. Multiply the numbers in the multiplication operation: 2 * 4 = 8
2. Replace the multiplication operation with the result: 5 + 8
3. Perform the addition operation: 5 + 8 = 13

So, the answer is 13.

The answer is 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: The multiplication part of the expression comes first in the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So the given expression becomes: 7 * 2 + 8 * 5

Now we perform the multiplication:

First, we multiply 7 by 2: 14
Then, we multiply 8 by 5: 40

Now, we perform addition as the last step:
14 (from the first multiplication)
+ 40 (from the second multiplication)

mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: The order of operations, also known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), tells us the sequence in which we should perform mathematical operations. Let's apply it step by step to your problem:

1. Parentheses: First we take care of any expressions inside parentheses. In your problem, there is one pair of parentheses: 2 + 5.

2 + 5 = 7

Now our expression looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

2. Exponents (none in this problem): since there are no exponents, we move on to the next step.

3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right): We have two multiplication operations, so we will do them one at a time.

First, let's calculate 2 * 3 = 6

Then, we perform the multiplication operation inside the parentheses: 4 * 7 = 28

Our expression now looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right): We have one addition and one subtraction operation, so we will do them one at a time.

First, let's perform the addition: 28 + 12 = 40

Then, let's perform the subtraction: 40 - 6 = 34

mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: The answer to this problem requires following the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this problem, we do not have any parentheses or exponents, so we begin with multiplication:

3 * 2 = 6

Now we have 5 + 6. 

Addition is the last operation in PEMDAS, so we perform it last:

5 + 6 = 11

So, the answer is:

mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 5 + 2*4, we need to follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). In this problem, we don't have any parentheses or exponents, so let's focus on the order of multiplication and addition.

Firstly, we need to perform the multiplication operation according to the order, which in this case is 2*4. Multiplying 2 and 4 gives us 8.

Now we have 5 + 8.

Adding 5 and 8 together, the final answer is:

The answer is __13__.

But, actually, we made a mistake in our calculation since we should have performed the addition before the multiplication according to the order of operations. Instead, the correct calculation should be:

First, add 5 and 4, giving the result 9.
Then, multiply 2 and 4, the result is 8.
Lastly, multiply the result of the addition (9) and multiplication (8), to give us the final answer which is 72.

The correct answer is:

The answer is __72__.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: The order of operations in mathematics is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). Here's how we apply it to the given problem:

First, we identify any expressions inside parentheses (if there were any), but there are none in the problem 7*2 + 8*5.

Next, we look for any exponents (if there were any), but again, there are none.

Then, we perform any multiplication and division, working from left to right. The problem has two multiplication operations: 7*2 and 8*5. In this case, since there's no clear order to follow given the absence of parentheses or exponents, we follow the multiplication rule ""multiply all the numbers that have exponents equal to 1"" (since 1 and 2 are the exponents in both terms). So before performing the addition, we first multiply 7 and 2 (since they both have an exponent equal to 1):

7*2 = 14

Now we have: 14 + 8*5.

Applying the same rule here, we have:

8*5 = 40

So, the sum of 14 and 40 is:
