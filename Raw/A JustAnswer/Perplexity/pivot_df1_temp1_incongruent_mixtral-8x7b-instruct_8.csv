mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Hello there! I see that you've given me a math problem to solve: 7 * 2 + 8 * 5. As a 6th-grade student, I'm learning about the order of operations, also known as BIDMAS or PEMDAS, which helps us solve math expressions in the correct sequence.

First, we perform any operations inside Parentheses or Brackets, if there are any. Since there are none in this problem, we proceed to the next step.

Next, we deal with Indices (or Exponents) and/or Fractions, if any. In this problem, there are no indices or fractions, so we move on to the next step.

Then, we handle Multiplication and Division, from left to right. In this case, we'll perform the multiplication operations first:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now our equation looks like this: 14 + 40
