mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we perform any multiplications and divisions from left to right. In this case, we have 2 multiplications: 7 * 2 and 8 * 5

7 * 2 = (7 * 1) + (7 * 1) * 2 = 7 + 7 * 2 = 7 + 14 = 21
So, 7 * 2 = 21

8 * 5 = (8 * 1) + (8 * 1) * 5 = 8 + 8 * 5 = 8 + 40 = 48
So, 8 * 5 = 48

Now that we have the results of the multiplications, we move on to addition and subtraction from left to right:

7 * 2 + 8 * 5 = 21 + 48

Finally, we have the sum of two numbers, so we add them:

21 + 48 = 69
