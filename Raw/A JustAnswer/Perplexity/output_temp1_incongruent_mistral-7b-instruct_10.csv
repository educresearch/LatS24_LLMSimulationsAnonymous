2. We have two multiplication operations: 7 * 2 and 8 * 5. Since there's no multiplication inside any other multiplication or division, we can perform them at the same level in parallel. Multiplication distributes over addition, which means you can rewrite a problem as multiple multiplications and additions.

1. Parentheses: Solve the expression inside the parentheses first.
   2 + 5 = 7
   So we have: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

2. Multiplication and Division (from left to right): Perform the multiplication and division operations in order from left to right
   4 * 7 = 28
   2 * 3 = 6
   So we have: 28 + 12 - 6

3. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right): Perform the addition and subtraction operations in order from left to right
   Adding 28 and 12 gives 40
   Subtracting 6 from 40 gives 34

The answer is: The answer is 34."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this problem, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we will start with multiplication and division. We have 3 multiplied by 2. The solution for multiplication is 6.

Now we have addition. We add the results of the multiplication to the number that was originally added: 5 + 6.

The solution for addition is 11.

So, the answer is: The answer is 11."
