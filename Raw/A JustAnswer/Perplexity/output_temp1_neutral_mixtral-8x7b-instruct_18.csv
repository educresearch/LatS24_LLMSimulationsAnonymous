systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this expression, we have neither parentheses nor exponents, so we move on to multiplication. We see the number 3 multiplied by 2.

3 * 2 = 6

So, our expression now looks like this:

5 + 6

We now have addition, so we follow the order of operations and perform the addition.

5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11."
