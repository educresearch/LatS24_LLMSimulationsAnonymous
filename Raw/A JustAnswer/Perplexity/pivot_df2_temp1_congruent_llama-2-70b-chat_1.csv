llama-2-70b-chat,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Sure! Here's how we can solve this problem:

4*(2 + 5) = 4*(7) = 28

12 - 2*3 = 12 - 6 = 6

Now, we add 28 and 6:

28 + 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's how to solve the problem:

First, let's evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:

4*(2 + 5) = 4*7 = 28

Next, let's add 12:

28 + 12 = 40

Finally, let's subtract 2 times 3:

40 - 6 = 34

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's how to solve the problem using the order of operations:

1. First, evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7
2. Next, multiply 4 by 7: 4*7 = 28
3. Then, add 12: 28 + 12 = 40
4. Finally, subtract 2 times 3: 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.

Explanation:
The order of operations tells us to evaluate expressions inside parentheses first, then exponents (if there are any), then multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right. In this problem, we have parentheses, so we start by evaluating the expression inside them. We add 2 and 5 to get 7, then multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. Next, we add 12 to get 40. Finally, we subtract 2 times 3 to get 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations:

1. Parentheses: inside the parentheses we have 2 + 5 = 7
2. Exponents (none in this case)
3. Multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28
4. Addition: 28 + 12 = 40
5. Subtraction: 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."

llama-2-70b-chat,1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Sure! Here's how we can solve this problem:

5 + 3*2 = 5 + 6 = 11

So, the answer is 11.

Explanation:

In this problem, we have a straightforward calculation. We need to add 5 and 3 times 2, which is 6. When we add 5 and 6, we get 11. Therefore, the answer is 11.","GPT Response: Sure! Here's how to solve the problem:

First, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Parentheses: None
2. Exponents (none in this case)
3. Multiplication: 3 \* 2 = 6
4. Addition: 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Sure! Here's how to solve the problem using the order of operations:

1. Multiply 3 and 2: 3*2 = 6
2. Add 5 and 6: 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.

Explanation:

The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS helps us remember the order:

1. Parentheses (if there are any)
2. Exponents (if there are any)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

In the expression 5 + 3*2, we first multiply 3 and 2, then add 5 and 6. Therefore, the final answer is 11.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to explain my solution to this problem!

The first step in solving this problem is to follow the order of operations. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the correct order:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply this order to the given problem:

5 + 3*2

First, we need to Multiply 3 and 2, which gives us 6.

So, the equation becomes:

5 + 6

Next, we need to Add 5 and 6, which gives us 11.

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 11.
