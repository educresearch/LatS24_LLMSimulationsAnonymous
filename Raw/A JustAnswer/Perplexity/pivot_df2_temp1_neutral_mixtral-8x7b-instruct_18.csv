mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, solve the operation inside the parentheses:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, perform multiplication:

28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, do addition and subtraction from left to right:

40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we should follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, according to the order of operations, we need to solve the expression inside the parentheses:

4 * (2 + 5) = 4 * 7 = 28

Now, our expression becomes:

28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we perform multiplication:

2 * 3 = 6

So our expression is now:

28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

Therefore,

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, solve the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7

Now the equation looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, do the multiplication and division from left to right: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6, so the equation becomes: 28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, do addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40 and 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we start with the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5.

2 + 5 = 7

Now our equation looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we move on to Multiplication and Division from left to right. We do the first two operations simultaneously:

4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6, so now our equation becomes:

28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, we do Addition and Subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40 and 40 - 6 = 34
