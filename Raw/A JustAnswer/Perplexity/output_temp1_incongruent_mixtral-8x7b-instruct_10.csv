systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In our problem, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we move on to multiplication and division. We see the number 3 being multiplied by 2. So we perform the multiplication first:

5 + 6

Now, we are left with addition. We add the numbers 5 and 6 together:

11

Therefore, the answer is 11."
