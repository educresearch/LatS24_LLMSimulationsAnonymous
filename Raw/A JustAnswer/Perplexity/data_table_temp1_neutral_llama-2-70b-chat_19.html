      <td>GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's how we can solve this problem using the order of operations:<br><br>Step 1: Parentheses<br>The problem has parentheses in two places: 2+5 and 2*3. When we encounter parentheses, we need to follow the expression inside the parentheses first. So, let's start by adding 2 and 5:<br><br>2+5 = 7<br><br>Now, let's multiply 2 by 3:<br><br>2*3 = 6<br><br>Step 2: Exponents (None in this case)<br>Since there are no exponents in this problem, we can move on to the next step.<br><br>Step 3: Multiplication<br>The next operation is multiplication. We have two multiplication operations: 4*7 and 12. Let's multiply 4 by 7:<br><br>4*7 = 28<br><br>Now, let's multiply 12 by 1 (since there is no number in front of the 12):<br><br>12*1 = 12<br><br>Step 4: Addition and Subtraction<br>Now we have two addition and subtraction operations: 28 + 12 and 28 - 6. Let's add 28 and 12:<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>Now, let's subtract 6 from 40:<br><br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>And that's it! We've solved the problem.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!<br><br>The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:<br><br>1. Parentheses<br>2. Exponents (none in this case)<br>3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)<br>4.
