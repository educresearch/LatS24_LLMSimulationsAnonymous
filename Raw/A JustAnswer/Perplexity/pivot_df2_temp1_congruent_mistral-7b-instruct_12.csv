mistral-7b-instruct,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, we need to follow the order of operations, which is commonly remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Since there are parentheses in the expression, we'll start there:

1. Solve the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.
2. Now replace the parentheses with the number 7: 4*7 + 12 - 2*3

Next, we have multiplication and division:

1. Multiply 4 and 7: 28
2. Multiply 2 and 3: 6

Now, we only have addition and subtraction left:

1. Perform the subtraction: 28 + 12 - 6
2. Perform the addition: 40 - 6 = 34

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this expression, we follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Given expression: 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3

First, we perform the operation inside the parentheses:

4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3
= 4*(7) + 12 - 2*3
