mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Let's solve this expression step by step, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), which means we perform calculations in the following order: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Given expression: 4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3

First, perform the operation inside the parentheses:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, perform multiplication:

28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, do addition and subtraction from left to right:

40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we should follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, solve the expression within the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7

Then, multiply: 4 * 7 = 28

Now, add and subtract from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40, and then 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to do the operations inside the parentheses, which is addition in this case: 2 + 5 equals 7. So, now our equation looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

2. Next, we follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). So, we do the multiplications: 4 * 7 equals 28 and 2 * 3 equals 6. Our equation now looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

3. Finally, we do the additions and subtractions from left to right: 28 + 12 equals 40 and 40 - 6 equals 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure! The Mathematics problem is: 4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3

To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we need to solve the expression in the parentheses, which is 2 + 5.

2 + 5 = 7

So, the problem becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we need to do the multiplication and division from left to right. We have two multiplication operations: 4 * 7 and 2 * 3.

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

So, the problem becomes: 28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, we do addition and subtraction from left to right. We have three operations: 28 + 12, and then subtract 6 from the result.

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

Therefore,
