mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: To solve this expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this case, we have Multiplication (2 * 4) and Addition (5 +), but no Parentheses or Exponents. So we'll do the Multiplication first.

2 * 4 = 8

Now, we do the Addition:

mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: To solve this expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is commonly remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this expression, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we'll start with multiplication and division. There are two multiplication operations here: 7 * 2 and 8 * 5. Since multiplication is commutative, the order of these operations does not matter. However, we still need to decide which one to compute first according to PEMDAS. Since we're dealing with multiplication first and there is no division to consider, we'll compute 8 * 5: 

8 * 5 = 40

Now there is only one remaining multiplication operation: 7 * 2. We'll compute it next:

7 * 2 = 14

At this point, all multiplication and division have been completed. The next step is to do any addition or subtraction, but there is only one addition operation in the expression: 7 * 2 + 8 * 5. We can combine the numbers 7 and 14 from the completed multiplication steps and perform the addition:

14 + 40 = 54

So the answer is:

The answer is 54."

12 + 2

Perform the addition:

14

mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In the given expression, there are no parentheses or exponents. However, there is multiplication and addition. Usually, multiplication is performed before addition; this is known as the distributive property or the ""FOIL"" rule for multiplication. 

However, in this case, there is no need to apply the distributive property because we have a multiplication sign sandwiched between an addition and another multiplication. Instead, we can apply the acronym BIDMAS, which is a variation of PEMDAS especially created for problems involving multiple operations in a single term: Brackets, Indices (Exponents), Division and Fractions, Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction.

According to this order, multiplication is the third operation to be calculated. So, let's compute it:

5 + 3 * 2
= 5 + (3 * 2)

Now, we can perform the multiplication:

= 5 + (6)

Finally, we'll perform the addition:

= 5 + 6
= 11
