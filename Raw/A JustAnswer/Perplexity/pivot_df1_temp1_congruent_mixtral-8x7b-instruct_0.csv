mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you understand how to solve this problem using the order of operations!

The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us the correct order to perform mathematical operations. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Let's apply the order of operations to solve the given problem:

4 *(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3

First, we need to solve the expression inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5. The answer is 7.

So the expression becomes:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2*3

Next, we perform multiplication and division from left to right. We multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. We also multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6.

So the expression becomes:

28 + 12 - 6

Finally, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right. We add 28 and 12, which equals 40. We then subtract 6 from 40.

The answer is 34."
