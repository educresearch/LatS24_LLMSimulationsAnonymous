llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:

1. Parentheses (if there are any)
2. Exponents (if there are any)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply this order to the expression 7 * 2 + 8 * 5:

1. Parentheses: None
2. Exponents: None
3. Multiplication and Division: We have two multiplication operations, 7 * 2 and 8 * 5. We perform them from left to right, so we calculate 7 * 2 first.
7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40
4. Addition and Subtraction: Now, we add the two results we got:
14 + 40 = 54

So, the final answer is 54.

llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's how we can solve this problem using the order of operations:

1. First, we need to follow the rule ""parameters before operations."" In this case, we have a multiplication sign before the addition sign, so we need to evaluate the multiplication first.
2. Multiply 4 and 3: 4 × 3 = 12
3. Now we need to add 2 to 12: 12 + 2 = 14

So, the final answer is 14.

The answer is 38.

Explanation:

* The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS helps us remember the order:
	+ P stands for ""Parentheses"" (if there are any)
	+ E stands for ""Exponents"" (if there are any)
	+ M stands for ""Multiplication""
	+ D stands for ""Division""
	+ A stands for ""Addition""
	+ S stands for ""Subtraction""
* In this problem, we have parentheses, so we follow them first. Inside the parentheses we have 2+5, which equals 7.
* Next, we multiply 4 by 7, which gives us 28.
* Then, we add 12, which brings us to 40.
* Finally, we subtract 2 times 3, which is 6, and we are left with 38.

llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

The problem we're working on is 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3.

The first thing we need to do is follow the order of operations. The order of operations is like a recipe for solving mathematical expressions. It tells us which operations to perform first. The order is:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents (none in this case)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

So, let's start by evaluating the expression inside the parentheses. We have 2+5 = 7.

Now, we multiply 4 by 7 = 28.

Next, we add 12 = 40.

Finally, we subtract 2 times 3 = 6.

Therefore, the final answer is 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34."
