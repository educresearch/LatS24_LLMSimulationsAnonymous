llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Sure! Here's how I would solve the problem using the order of operations:

1. First, multiply 2 and 4: 2*4 = 8
2. Next, add 5 and 8: 5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.

Explanation: The order of operations tells us to perform multiplication before addition. So, we multiply 2 and 4 first, and then add 5 and 8. This gives us the final answer of 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Sure, I can help you with that!

The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:

1. Parentheses (if there are any)
2. Exponents (if there are any)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply this order to the expression 7*2+8*5:

1. Parentheses: None
2. Exponents: None
3. Multiplication and Division: We have two multiplication operations: 7*2 and 8*5. We perform them from left to right, so we multiply 7 and 2 first, then 8 and 5.
7*2 = 14
8*5 = 40
4. Addition and Subtraction: We add 14 and 40.
14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.

Therefore, 7*2+8*5 = 54."

llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

The order of operations tells us to follow these steps:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents (none in this case)
3. Multiplication
4. Addition
5. Subtraction

So, let's start by multiplying 4 and 2+5:
4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28

Next, we add 12:
28 + 12 = 40

Finally, we subtract 2 times 3:
40 - 6 = 34

In this case, there are no parentheses or exponents, so I would start with step 3.

3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)

The problem is 5 + 2 * 4. The multiplication comes before the addition, so I would do the multiplication first.

2 * 4 = 8

Now, I would add 5 and 8.

5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.
