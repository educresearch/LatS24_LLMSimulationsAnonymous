systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: The order of operations in mathematics is represented by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and division (from left to right), Addition and subtraction (from left to right).

In the given expression, there are no parentheses or exponents, but we do have multiplication (3*2) and addition (5+). According to the order of operations, we should first do the multiplication.

So, we multiply 3 and 2 to get 6.

Then, we do the addition.

So, we add 5 and 6 (which is the same as saying, 5 + 3 * 2 or 5 + 6).

The answer is 11."
