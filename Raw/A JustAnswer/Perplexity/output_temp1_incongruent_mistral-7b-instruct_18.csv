systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS or Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this problem, there are no parentheses or exponents. We have multiplication and addition. According to the order of operations, we should do multiplication before addition.

So let's do the multiplication first:
3 * 2 = 6

Now we have 5 + 6

Adding 5 and 6:
5 + 6 = 11

The answer is:

The answer is 11."
