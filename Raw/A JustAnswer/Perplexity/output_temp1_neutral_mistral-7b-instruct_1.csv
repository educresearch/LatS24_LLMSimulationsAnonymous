In the given problem, we do not have any parentheses or exponents, so we move on to the next operation, which is multiplication.

So, we first perform the multiplication operation:
3 * 2 = 6

Now that we have handled the multiplication, we move on to the addition operation:
5 + 6

Performing the addition, we get the final answer:
5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11."
