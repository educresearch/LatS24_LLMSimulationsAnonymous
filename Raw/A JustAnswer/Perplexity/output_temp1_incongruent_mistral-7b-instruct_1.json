So, the problem becomes:\n\n5 + 3 * 2\n\nNow, we have only addition. Furthermore, since we're dealing with single-digit numbers, carrying over never occurs in this case. Therefore, addition follows the regular left-to-right order. However, since our multiplication was done before addition, our 3 * 2 results in 6.\n\nNow, we add 5 and 6:\n\n5 + 6 = 11\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nThe answer is __.\n__ = 11."}]}]
