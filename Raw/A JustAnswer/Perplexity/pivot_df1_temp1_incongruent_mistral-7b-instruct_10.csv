mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we'll take care of the parentheses:

4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3

4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we'll do the operation inside the parentheses:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations which is also known as PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Let's apply it to the problem:

1. There are no parentheses, exponents, or multiplication inside each other in this problem, so we proceed to the next step.

2. We have two multiplication operations: 7 * 2 and 8 * 5. Since there's no multiplication inside any other multiplication or division, we can perform them at the same level in parallel. Multiplication distributes over addition, which means you can rewrite a problem as multiple multiplications and additions. In this case, we can apply the distributive property as: 7 * 2 + 8 * 5 = (7 * 2) + (8 * 5).

3. Now, we have two multiplication operations inside the parentheses: 7 * 2 and 8 * 5. We'll do them one at a time, from left to right according to the order of operations.

   - 7 * 2 = 14
   - 8 * 5 = 40

4. Now, we can add the results of the multiplications: 14 + 40

5. Perform addition from left to right: 14 = initial value
   40 = next value
