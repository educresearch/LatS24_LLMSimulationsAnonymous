systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In our problem, we have neither parentheses nor exponents. So we move on to the next step: Multiplication and Division. We see the number 3 multiplied by 2, so we perform the multiplication first:

5 + 3*2 = 5 + 6

Now we are left with addition. We add 5 and 6:

5 + 6 = 11

So, the answer is 11."
