The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:

1. Parentheses (if there are any)
2. Exponents (if there are any)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply this to the expression 5+2 * 4:

1. Parentheses: None
2. Exponents: None
3. Multiplication and Division: 2 * 4 = 8
4. Addition and Subtraction: 5 + 8 = 13

The problem is 4 * 3 + 2.

First, we need to follow the order of operations, which is PEMDAS:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

In this case, we have parentheses, so we need to evaluate what's inside the parentheses first.

Inside the parentheses we have 4 * 3, which is equal to 12.

Now, we need to add 2 to 12.
