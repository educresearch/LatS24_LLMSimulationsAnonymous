4*(2 + 5) = 4*7 = 28

Add 12: 28 + 12 = 40

Subtract 2*3: 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's how to solve the problem:

First, let's start by evaluating the expression inside the parentheses:

4*(2 + 5) = 4*7 = 28

Next, we add 12:

28 + 12 = 40

Finally, we subtract 2 times 3:

40 - 6 = 34

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure, I can help you with that!

The order of operations tells us to follow these steps:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents (none in this case)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

So, let's follow these steps:

1. Parentheses: inside the parentheses we have 2 + 5 = 7
2. Multiplication and Division: 4 * 7 = 28
3. Addition and Subtraction: 28 + 12 = 40
4. Finally, we subtract 2 * 3 = 6

The answer is 40 - 6 = 34.

So, the final answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure! Here's how I would solve the problem using the order of operations:

1. First, I would evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses:

The order of operations tells us to evaluate expressions inside parentheses first, so we'll start by multiplying 2 and 4:

2*4 = 8

Now, we add 5 and 8:

5 + 8 = 13

So, the final answer is 13.

The problem is 5 + 2*4.

First, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations is:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

In this problem, we have parentheses, so we need to evaluate what's inside the parentheses first. Inside the parentheses we have 2*4.

2*4 = 8

Now we need to add 5 to 8.

5 + 8 = 13

5 + 3*2 = 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.

Explanation:

In this problem, we have a multiplication expression inside the parentheses, which means we need to evaluate that expression first. In this case, 3*2 = 6. Then, we add 5 to 6, which gives us 11. Therefore, the final answer is 11.","GPT Response: Sure! Here's how to solve the problem:

The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply this order to the expression 5 + 3*2:

1. Parentheses: None
2. Exponents: None
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right): 3*2 = 6
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right): 5 + 6 = 11

Therefore, the final answer is 11.

When we have multiplication and addition in the same expression, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us which operations to perform first.

The order of operations is:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply this to the problem 7*2 + 8*5:

1. Parentheses: None
2. Exponents: None
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right):
	* 7*2 = 14
	* 8*5 = 40
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right):
