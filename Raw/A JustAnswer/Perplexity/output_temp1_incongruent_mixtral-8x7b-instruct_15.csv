So the problem becomes: 28 + 12 - 6.

Lastly, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right. We first add 28 and 12, which equals 40.

So the problem becomes: 40 - 6.

Finally, we subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34.

The answer is 34."

In this problem, we have addition and multiplication. According to PEMDAS, we should do the multiplication first:

3 \* 2 = 6

Now we have a new problem: 5 + 6. According to PEMDAS, we should do the addition next:

5 + 6 = 11

So, the answer is:

The answer is 11."
