In this problem, we do not have any parentheses or exponents, so we will focus on the next rule which is to perform multiplication and division from left to right.

Let's apply this rule to the given problem: 

5 + 3 * 2

First, we perform the multiplication: 

5 + 3 * 2
5 + 3 * 2 ≤-- Perform multiplication 
5 + 6

Then, we perform the addition:

5 + 6

The answer is:

__
7. So, the final answer is 7."
