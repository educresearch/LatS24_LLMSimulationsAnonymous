llama-2-70b-chat,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Sure! Here's how we can evaluate this expression:

4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure! Here's how to solve the problem:

1. First, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):
	* Parentheses: inside the parentheses we have 2+5 = 7
2. Next, we multiply 4 by 7: 4 * 7 = 28
3. Then, we add 12: 28 + 12 = 40
4. Finally, we subtract 2 times 3: 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure! Here's how to solve the problem using the order of operations:

1. Parentheses: Inside the parentheses we have 2+5 = 7
2. Exponents (there are none in this case)
3. Multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28
4. Addition: 28 + 12 = 40
5. Subtraction: 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.

Explanation:

The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:

P - Parentheses (evaluate expressions inside parentheses first)
E - Exponents (evaluate any exponents, such as squaring or cubing)
M - Multiplication (evaluate multiplication next)
D - Division (evaluate division next)
A - Addition (evaluate addition next)
S - Subtraction (evaluate subtraction last)

In this problem, we start by evaluating the expression inside the parentheses, which gives us 2+5 = 7. Then we multiply 4 by 7, which gives us 28. Next, we add 12 to 28, which gives us 40. Finally, we subtract 2 times 3 from 40, which gives us 34.

So, the final answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

First, let's follow the order of operations:

1. Parentheses: Inside the parentheses we have 2+5=7
2. Exponents (none in this case)

5. Subtraction: 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

Therefore, the final answer is:

The problem is 5+2 * 4.

First, we need to follow the order of operations, which is PEMDAS:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

In this problem, we have parentheses, so we need to evaluate what's inside the parentheses first. Inside the parentheses, we have 2 * 4.

2 * 4 = 8

Now, we can move on to the next step, which is addition. We have 5 + 8.

5 + 8 = 13

Therefore, the final answer is 13.

The order of operations tells us to follow these steps when solving an expression:

1. Parentheses (if there are any)
2. Exponents (if there are any)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply this to the problem 5+3 * 2:

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in this expression.
