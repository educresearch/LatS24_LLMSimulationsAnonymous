mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: When solving expressions that contain both addition and multiplication, we should follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this case, we have the expression 5 + 2 * 4. According to the order of operations, we should do the multiplication before the addition. So we calculate 2 * 4 first, which equals 8. Then we substitute 8 for 2 * 4 into the original expression, resulting in 5 + 8. Finally, we perform the addition to get 13.

The answer is 13."
