llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Sure, I can help you with that!

The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an equation. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:

1. Parentheses (if there are any)
2. Exponents (if there are any)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply this order to the equation 5 + 2*4:

1. Parentheses: None
2. Exponents: None
3. Multiplication and Division: 2*4 = 8
4. Addition and Subtraction: 5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.

Therefore, the final answer is:
The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help!

The order of operations tells us to follow these steps:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

So let's apply this to the problem:

7*2 + 8*5

First, we multiply 7 and 2:

7*2 = 14

Next, we multiply 8 and 5:

8*5 = 40

Now we add 14 and 40:

14 + 40 = 54

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 54."

Explanation:
When solving mathematical expressions, we follow the order of operations, which is often abbreviated as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction). In this case, we first multiply 4 and 3, which gives us 12. Then, we add 2 to 12, which gives us our final answer of 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's how to solve the problem using the order of operations:

1. First, we need to follow the order of operations, which is:

PEMDAS

a) Parentheses
b) Exponents
c) Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
d) Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)
2. In this problem, we have parentheses, so we need to start by evaluating what's inside the parentheses. Inside the parentheses we have:

2 + 5 = 7

So, the expression inside the parentheses is 7.
3. Next, we need to multiply 4 by 7, which gives us:

4*7 = 28

4. Now we need to add 12 to 28, which gives us:

28 + 12 = 40

5. Finally, we need to subtract 2 times 3 from 40, which gives us:

40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.

So, the final answer is 34."
