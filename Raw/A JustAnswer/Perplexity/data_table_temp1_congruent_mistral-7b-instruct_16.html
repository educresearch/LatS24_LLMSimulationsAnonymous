Multiplication and Division: We don't have any exponents, multiplication or division signs yet, so we can skip this step for now.<br><br>5. Addition and Subtraction: We have an addition sign (+) in the given expression. According to the PEMDAS rule, we perform additions and subtractions from left to right.
