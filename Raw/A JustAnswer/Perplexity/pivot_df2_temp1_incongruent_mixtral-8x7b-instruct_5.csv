mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Let's solve this expression by following the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, solve the operation in the parentheses:  
4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3 
= 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, do the multiplication and division from left to right:  
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3 
= 28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, do the addition and subtraction from left to right:  
28 + 12 - 6 
= 40 - 6 
= 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we evaluate the expression in the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7

Then, we multiply: 4 * 7 = 28

Next, we add: 28 + 12 = 40

Lastly, we multiply: 2 * 3 = 6

And then subtract: 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Let's solve this step by step using the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS:

1. Parentheses: (2 + 5) equals 7.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this problem.
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right): First, do 4 times 7, which equals 28. Then, do 2 times 3, which equals 6.
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right): First, do 28 plus 12, which equals 40. Then, do 40 minus 6, which equals 34.

The answer is 34.

So, when solving the expression 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3, make sure to follow the order of operations, which are parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This will help you get the correct answer.","GPT Response: Sure! To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, let's do the operation inside the parentheses:

2 + 5 = 7

So, the expression now becomes:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we do multiplication and division from left to right:

4 * 7 = 28, so the expression becomes:

28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Then, 2 * 3 = 6, so the expression becomes:

28 + 12 - 6

Finally, we do addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40, so the expression becomes:

40 - 6

And 40 - 6 = 34.

Therefore, The answer is 34."
