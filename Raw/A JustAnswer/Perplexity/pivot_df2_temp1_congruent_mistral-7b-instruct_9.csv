mistral-7b-instruct,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3, follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):

1. Parentheses: Solve expressions in parentheses first. Here, there is only one pair of parentheses, 2 + 5.
   The sum of 2 and 5 is 7.

2. Exponents: None in this expression.

3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right): Here we have two multiplication operations and one division (but none in this expression). Perform the multiplications first.
   Multiply 4 and 7: 28
   Multiply 2 and 3: 6

4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right): Perform the addition and subtraction indicated.
   Add 12 and 6: 18
   Subtract 2 from the result: 16

Putting it all together, we have:

4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3 = 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3
                 = 28 + 12 - 6
