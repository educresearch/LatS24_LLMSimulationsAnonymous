mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Let's solve this expression step by step, following the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This order is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.

The expression given is:

4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3

First, let's handle the parentheses. Add 2 and 5:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, perform multiplication:

28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, do addition and subtraction from left to right:

40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:

4 * (2 + 5) = 4 * 7 = 28

Then, we have:

28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we do the multiplication:

28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Let's solve this step by step using the order of operations, which is also known as BIDMAS or PEMDAS:

Brackets/parentheses: First, solve the operation inside the parentheses.
2 + 5 = 7

Now the equation looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, apply exponents, but since there are no exponents in this equation, we can move on to:

Multiplication and Division (from left to right):
4 * 7 = 28, so the equation becomes: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3
Then, 2 * 3 = 6, so the equation becomes: 28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, perform Addition and Subtraction (from left to right):
28 + 12 = 40, so the equation becomes: 40 - 6

And finally, subtract: 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, let's do the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.

So, the equation now looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, we do multiplication and division from left to right. Multiply 4 by 7 to get 28, and multiply 2 by 3 to get 6.

Now the equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.

Lastly, we do addition and subtraction from left to right. Add 28 and 12 to get 40, then subtract 6 to get 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34."
