Next, we handle Addition and Subtraction from left to right. First, we add 28 and 12, which gives us 40.

So, the problem now looks like this: 40 - 2*3.

Lastly, we handle the remaining Multiplication and Subtraction. So, we multiply 2 and 3, giving us 6.

So, the problem now looks like this: 40 - 6.

And finally, we Subtract 6 from 40, giving us 34.

Therefore, The answer is 34."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

At first glance, it might seem like we should do the addition first because it comes before multiplication in the problem. But according to PEMDAS, we should do the multiplication before the addition.

So, we first multiply 3 and 2 to get 6.
Then, we add 5 to the result of the multiplication to get 11.

Therefore, the answer is 11.

The answer is 11."
