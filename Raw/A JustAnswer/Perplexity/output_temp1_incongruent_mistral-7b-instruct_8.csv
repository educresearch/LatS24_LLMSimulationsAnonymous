systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we have parentheses included in the expression, so we'll calculate what's inside:

2 + 5 = 7

Now, we have 4 multiplied by 7, so we'll do the multiplication:

4 * 7 = 28

After that, we have addition and subtraction. Since we have both addition and subtraction, we'll do the subtraction first, as it comes before addition in PEMDAS:

28 - 2 * 3

Next, we calculate the multiplication inside the parentheses:

2 * 3 = 6

Now, we can do the subtraction:

28 - 6 = 22

So, the final answer to the problem ""4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3"" is:

The answer is 22."

In this case, we do not have any parentheses or exponents, so we'll focus on Multiplication and Division (MD) and Addition and Subtraction (AS).

According to the MD rule, we should perform multiplication and division from left to right. Therefore, we first focus on the 3 * 2 multiplication.

6 = 5 (The first number in the problem)
Multiplication: 6 x 2 = 12

Now, we substitute the result of the multiplication into the addition equation:

Addition: 5 + 12 = 17

So the answer is:

The answer is __.
The answer is 17."
