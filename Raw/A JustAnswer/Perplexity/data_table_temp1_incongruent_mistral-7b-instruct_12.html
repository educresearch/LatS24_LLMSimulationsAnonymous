Perform any addition and subtraction:<br>   Let's do subtraction first:<br>    We have -2 * 3, which equals -6. So now the expression is: 4 * 7 + 12 + (-6)<br><br>4. Finally, perform left-to-right addition and subtraction:<br>    We have: 4 * 7 + 12 + (-6)<br>    The first calculation is: 28 + 12 = 40<br><br>The answer is 40.</td>
