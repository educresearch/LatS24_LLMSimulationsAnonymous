      <td>GPT Response: Let's solve this step by step:<br><br>1. First, we need to do the operations inside the parentheses, which is addition in this case: 2 + 5 equals 7. So now our equation looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br>2. Next, we follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). So, we have to do the multiplications and divisions before the additions and subtractions. 4 times 7 equals 28, and 2 times 3 equals 6. So now our equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6<br>3. Finally, from left to right, we do addition and subtraction. 28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
