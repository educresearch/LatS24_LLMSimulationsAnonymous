When solving mathematical expressions, we need to follow a specific order of operations. This order is often remembered using the acronym PEMDAS:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply this order to the given expression:

4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3

First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7

Now, we can multiply 4 by 7: 4*7 = 28

Next, we add 12: 28 + 12 = 40

Finally, we subtract 2 times 3: 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.

So, the final answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

The problem is 5 + 2*4.

First, we need to follow the order of operations, which is PEMDAS:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

In this case, we have parentheses, so we need to evaluate what's inside the parentheses first.

Inside the parentheses we have 2*4. We multiply 2 and 4 to get 8.

Now, we take the result of the multiplication (8) and add it to 5, which gives us 13.

The answer is 13.

Explanation:
The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:

1. Parentheses (if there are any)
2. Exponents (if there are any)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

In this problem, we first multiply 7 and 2, then multiply 8 and 5. Next, we add 14 and 40 to get our final answer, 54.

It's important to follow the order of operations to ensure we get the correct answer. If we did the addition before the multiplication, for example, we would get a different result.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. This means we need to do the operations inside the parentheses first, then the exponents, and finally the multiplication and addition.

So, let's start by looking at the problem: 7*2 + 8*5

The first thing we need to do is multiply 7 and 2. We can do this by counting up 7 groups of 2, which gives us a product of 14.

Next, we need to multiply 8 and 5. We can do this by counting up 8 groups of 5, which gives us a product of 40.

Now, we need to add 14 and 40. This gives us a total of 54.

So, the final answer is 54.

The answer is 54."
