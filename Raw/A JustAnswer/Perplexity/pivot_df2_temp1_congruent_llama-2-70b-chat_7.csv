The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply this order to the given expression:

4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3

Step 1: Evaluate expressions inside parentheses.
The expression inside parentheses is 2 + 5, which evaluates to 7.

Step 2: Evaluate exponents (none in this case).

Step 3: Evaluate multiplication and division from left to right.
We have 4*7 = 28.

Step 4: Evaluate addition and subtraction from left to right.
We have 28 + 12 = 40.

Step 5: Evaluate the final answer.
The answer is 40.

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 40.","GPT Response: Sure! Here's how I would solve this problem using the order of operations:

1. First, I would evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7
2. Next, I would multiply 4 by 7: 4*7 = 28
3. Then, I would add 12: 28 + 12 = 40
4. Finally, I would subtract 2 times 3: 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."

The problem is 4*3 + 2.

First, we need to follow the order of operations, which is PEMDAS:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

5 + 3*2 = 5 + 6 = 11

So, the answer is 11.","GPT Response: Sure! Here's how to solve the problem:

5 + 3*2 = 5 + 6

The order of operations tells us to follow these steps:

1. Look for any parentheses or other grouping symbols.
2. Evaluate any expressions inside the parentheses or other grouping symbols.
3. Look for any exponents (such as squaring or cubing).
4. Look for any multiplication or division (from left to right).
5. Look for any addition or subtraction (from left to right).

So let's apply this to the problem 5 + 3*2:

1. There are no parentheses or other grouping symbols, so we can move on to step 2.
2. There are no expressions inside parentheses or other grouping symbols, so we can move on to step 3.
3. There are no exponents, so we can move on to step 4.
4. We see that there is a multiplication symbol (the asterisk) between 3 and 2. We need to evaluate this expression first. 3*2 = 6.
5. Now we can move on to the addition symbol (the plus sign). We add 5 and 6, which gives us 11.

So, the final answer is 11.

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help!

The problem is 5 + 3*2.

First, we need to follow the order of operations, which is PEMDAS:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

In this case, we have parentheses, so we need to evaluate what's inside the parentheses first. Inside the parentheses, we have 3*2.

So, we multiply 3 and 2, and we get 6.

Now, we can proceed to the next step, which is addition. We have 5 + 6, and we add them together to get 11.

Therefore, the final answer is 11.

To solve this problem, we can start by multiplying 7 and 2:

7*2 = 14

When we have multiplication and addition in the same expression, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations is PEMDAS:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents (none in this case)
3. Multiplication
4. Addition

1. Multiply 7 and 2: 7*2 = 14
2. Multiply 8 and 5: 8*5 = 40
3. Add 14 and 40: 14 + 40 = 54

So, let's start with the parentheses. We have 7*2 inside parentheses, so we need to evaluate that first.

7*2 = 14

Next, we have 8*5 outside the parentheses. Let's evaluate that next.

8*5 = 40
