In this scenario, there are no parentheses, exponents, or division. We just have multiplication and addition.

Let's first perform the multiplication, which is 4 times 3, giving us an answer of 12.

Now, we have the result of the multiplication, 12, and we add 2 to it. Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 4*3 + 2, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this problem, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we'll go to the next rule: Multiplication and Division. We have 4 multiplied by 3.

So, do the multiplication first:
12 (4 * 3)

Now, there's an addition operation left: 12 + 2

Following the last rule, Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), complete the addition:

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: The order of operations, also known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction), tells us the sequence in which we should perform mathematical operations. In the given problem, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we will follow the rule of BIDMAS or BODMAS, which stands for Brackets/Boses, Indices/Orders, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this given problem (4*3+2), since there are no brackets or indices, the next rule is to perform multiplication and division from left to right. In this case, we have multiplication (4*3).

So, first, we multiply 4 and 3, which equals 12. Now we have 12 and 2 left for the addition operation (since addition is the last rule to follow according to the order of operations).

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 12+2.

But, before you add 12 and 2, recall that no matter how many zeros you add at the end of a number, it doesn't change the value. As a result, you don't need to carry out multi-digit multiplication within a single digit multiplication; instead, you can directly perform the addition.

So, let's perform the addition:

The answer is 12+2 = 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: According to the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS or BODMAS, we should perform multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. In this expression, we have multiplication. So, let's do that first:

2 * 4 = 8

Now, let's substitute this value back into the original expression:

5 + 2 * 4
5 + 2 * 4 = 5 + 8

Finally, add the numbers:

In this problem, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we move on to the next steps. 

Multiplication comes before addition, so we firstmultiply 2 and 4 to get 8.

Then, we add 5 to the result of the multiplication. 

So, the solution is:

5 + 2*4 = 5 + 8 = 13

In this problem, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we move to the next step: Multiplication and Division. Here, we see that there is a multiplication sign (*) between 2 and 4. So, we perform this operation first:

5 + 2 * 4

5 + 8

Now we have addition, so we perform it from left to right:

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 2 * 4, we need to follow the order of operations which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, standing for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we need to identify if there are any parentheses or exponents, but in this case, there are none. So, we move on to the next step.

The next steps are Multiplication and Division, so we look for any multiplication or division signs. We have 2 multiplications, one is 2 * 4 and the other one is implicit because of the way the expression is written - the addition sign + is lower precedence than multiplication. Thus, we need to perform the multiplication before the addition.

So, we calculate 2 * 4 = 8

Now we have 5 + 8. 

Lastly, we perform the addition: 5 + 8 = 13

The answer is __.
