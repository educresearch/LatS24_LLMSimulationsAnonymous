Addition comes before subtraction, so we'll do it from left to right:\n\n28 + 12\n\n40 (result of adding 28 and 12)\n\nNow, we only have subtraction left:\n\n40 - 2 * 3\n\nWe need to follow the order of operations, which is subtraction from left to right as well. However, we're supposed to do multiplication before subtraction. So, we should first perform the multiplication:\n\n6 (since 2 * 3 = 6)\n\nNow we'll subtract 6 from the result of 40 we had before (which was the intermediate step before doing the multiplication):\n\n34 (result of subtracting 6 from 40)\n\nThe answer is: __\n\nThe final answer is 34."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500", "model": "mistral-7b-instruct", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 500, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in grade 6 learning order of operations for the first time.\n                    Explain your solution to this given Mathematics problem, and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "5 + 3*2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nFirst, we have multiplication: 3 * 2 = 6.\n\nNow, we substitute the result back into the original expression: 5 + 6.\n\nNext, we have addition: 5 + 6 = 11.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nThe answer is __.\nThe answer is 11."}]}]
