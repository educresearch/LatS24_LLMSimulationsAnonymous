llama-2-70b-chat,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's how we can work through the problem step by step:

4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28

Now, we add 12:

28 + 12 = 40

Finally, we subtract 2 times 3:

40 - 6 = 34

4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28

Now, let's add 12:

28 + 12 = 40

Finally, let's subtract 2 times 3:

40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure! Here's how I would solve this problem using the order of operations:

1. First, we need to follow the parentheses. Inside the parentheses we have 2+5 = 7
2. Next, we multiply 4 by 7 = 28
3. Then, we add 12 = 40
4. Finally, we subtract 2 times 3 = 38

The answer is 38.

Explanation:

The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS helps us remember the order:

P - parentheses
E - exponents
M - multiplication
D - division
A - addition
S - subtraction

In this problem, we have parentheses, so we start by following what's inside them. Inside the parentheses we have 2+5, which equals 7. Next, we multiply 4 by 7, which gives us 28. Then, we add 12, which makes 40. Finally, we subtract 2 times 3, which gives us 38.

Therefore, the final answer is 38.","GPT Response: Sure! Here's how I would solve the problem using the order of operations:

1. First, we need to follow the parentheses. Inside the parentheses we have 2+5=7.
2. Next, we multiply 4 by 7, which gives us 28.
3. Then, we add 12 to 28, which gives us 40.
4. Finally, we subtract 2 times 3, which is 6, from 40.

The answer is 34.

So, the final answer is 34."

When we encounter an expression like 5+3 * 2, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the correct order:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply PEMDAS to our expression:

1. Parentheses: None
2. Exponents: None
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right): 3 * 2 = 6
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right): 5 + 6 = 11
