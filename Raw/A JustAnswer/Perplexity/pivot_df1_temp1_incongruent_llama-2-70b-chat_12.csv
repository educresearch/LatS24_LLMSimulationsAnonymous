llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Sure! Here's how we can solve this problem using the order of operations:

1. First, we need to follow the rule that says ""Parentheses come first."" In this case, we have parentheses around the expression 2 * 4.
2. Inside the parentheses, we multiply 2 and 4 to get 8.
3. Next, we look for any Exponents (such as squaring or cubing). In this case, there are no exponents.
4. Fourth, we look for any multiplication or division from left to right. In this case, we have a multiplication of 5 and 8.
5. Finally, we add 5 and 8 to get 13.

The answer is 13.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we got our answer:

1. 5 + 2 * 4 = 5 + 8 = 13

llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Sure, I can help you with that!

The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply this order to the given problem:

7 * 2 + 8 * 5

First, we need to multiply 7 and 2:
7 * 2 = 14

Next, we need to multiply 8 and 5:
8 * 5 = 40

Now, we need to add 14 and 40:
14 + 40 = 54

Therefore, the final answer is:

The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:

1. Parentheses (if there are any)
2. Exponents (none in this case)
3. Multiplication (4 * 3)
4. Addition (none in this case)
5. Subtraction (none in this case)

So, first, we multiply 4 and 3, which gives us 12.

Next, we add 2 to 12, which gives us 14.

The answer is 14.

Explanation:

* We start by evaluating the expression inside the parentheses, which gives us 2+5 = 7.
* Next, we multiply 4 by 7, which gives us 28.
* Then, we add 12 to 28, which gives us 40.
* Finally, we subtract 2 times 3 from 40, which gives us 34.
