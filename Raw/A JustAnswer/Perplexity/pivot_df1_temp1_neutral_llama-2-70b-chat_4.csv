llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply this to the expression 4*3+2:

1. Multiplication: 4*3 = 12
2. Addition: 12+2 = 14

The answer is 14.

So, the final answer is 14."
