systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this problem, we have addition and multiplication. According to the order of operations, we should do the multiplication first:

3 \* 2 = 6

Now, our problem looks like this: 5 + 6

Next, we perform the addition:

5 + 6 = 11

So, the answer is 11. The answer is __. Replace __ with 11. So, the answer is 11."
