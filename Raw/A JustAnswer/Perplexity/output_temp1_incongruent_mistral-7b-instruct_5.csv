systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 5 + 3 * 2, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we take care of the multiplication:
3 * 2 = 6

Now, we substitute this value back into the original problem and perform the addition:
5 + 6 = 11

So the answer is:
The answer is 11."
