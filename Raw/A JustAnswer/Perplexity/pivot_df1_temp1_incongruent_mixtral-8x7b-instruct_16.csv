mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: In this expression, multiplication should be done before addition according to the order of operations (also known as BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEDMAS). This rule tells us to perform calculations in the following order: Brackets, Indices/Orders/Exponents, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So, first, we perform the multiplication:

4 * 3 = 12

Now, we're left with:

12 + 2

Finally, perform the addition:

12 + 2 = 14
