Subtraction: 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34<br><br>The answer is 34.<br><br>Explanation:<br><br>The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:<br><br>P - Parentheses (evaluate expressions inside parentheses first)<br>E - Exponents (evaluate any exponents, such as squaring or cubing)<br>M - Multiplication (evaluate multiplication next)<br>D - Division (evaluate division next)<br>A - Addition (evaluate addition next)<br>S - Subtraction (evaluate subtraction last)<br><br>In this problem, we start by evaluating the expression inside the parentheses, which gives us 2+5 = 7. Then we multiply 4 by 7, which gives us 28. Next, we add 12 to 28, which gives us 40. Finally, we subtract 2 times 3 from 40, which gives us 34.<br><br>So, the final answer is 34.</td>
