systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the problem 5 + 3 * 2, we need to follow the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).

Since there are no parentheses or exponents in this problem, we'll start with multiplication and division.

First, we'll do the multiplication: 3 * 2 = 6

Now, we'll do the addition: 5 + 6 = 11

So, the answer is:

The answer is 11."
