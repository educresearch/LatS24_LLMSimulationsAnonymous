mistral-7b-instruct,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this expression, follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS or BODMAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, do the Operation Inside Parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

Now, evaluate the Multiplication and Division:
4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Next, do Addition and Subtraction (from left to right):
4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3
= 4 * 7 + 12 - 6
= 28 + 12 - 6

Combine the Constants:
4 * 7 + 12 - 6 = 28 + 12 - 6 = 42 - 6 = 36
