In this problem, we have neither parentheses nor exponents, so we move on to multiplication and division. We see that we have the number 3 being multiplied by 2. We perform this operation first:

5 + 6

Now, we are left with addition. We add the number 5 to 6:

11

Therefore, the answer is 11. The answer is 11."
