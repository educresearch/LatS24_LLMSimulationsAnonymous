Explanation: The order of operations tells us to perform multiplication before addition. So, we first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12, and then add 2 to get 14.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

When solving mathematical expressions, it's important to follow the Order of Operations. The Order of Operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first. The acronym for the Order of Operations is PEMDAS:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

So, let's apply PEMDAS to the expression 4*3 + 2.

First, we multiply 4 and 3:

4 × 3 = 12

Next, we add 2:

12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.

Therefore, the final answer is: The answer is 14."

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: Sure, I can help you with that!

The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:

1. Parentheses (if any)
2. Exponents (if any)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply this order to the expression 5 + 2*4:

1. Parentheses: None
2. Exponents: None
3. Multiplication and Division: 2*4 = 8
4. Addition and Subtraction: 5 + 8 = 13
