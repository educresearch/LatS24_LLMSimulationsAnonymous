In our problem, we have neither parentheses nor exponents. So, we move to the next step which is Multiplication and Division. We see that we have the number 3 multiplied by 2. According to PEMDAS, we should do the multiplication first.

3 * 2 = 6

Now, our expression looks like this:

5 + 6

Finally, we do addition (from left to right). So, we add 5 and 6.

5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11."
