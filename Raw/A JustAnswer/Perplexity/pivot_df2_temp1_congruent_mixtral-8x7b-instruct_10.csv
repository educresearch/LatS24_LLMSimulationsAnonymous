This order is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.

Given expression: 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3

First, perform the operation inside the parentheses:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2*3

Next, do the multiplication:

28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, do addition and subtraction from left to right:

40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we should follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we do the operation in the parentheses:

4 * (7) + 12 - 2*3

Next, we perform multiplication:

28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, we do addition and subtraction from left to right:

40 - 6 = 34

First, solve the operation in the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7

Then, multiply: 4 * 7 = 28

Now, add 12: 28 + 12 = 40

Lastly, subtract: 40 - 2*3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure! The mathematical expression you've given me is:

4 *(2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3

To solve this, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we tackle the operation in parentheses, which is 2 + 5. Adding those numbers together gives us:

4 *(7) + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we move on to multiplication. There are two multiplication operations in this expression, so we do them from left to right. First, let's do 4*7:

28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Now, let's do the second multiplication, which is 2*3:

28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right. First, add 28 and 12:

40 - 6

And finally, subtract 6 from 40:
