mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: To solve the given expression, we need to follow the order of operations which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this case, we don't have any parentheses or exponents, so we'll proceed with the multiplication and addition parts.

We have two multiplication operations: 1) 7 * 2 and 2) 8 * 5. According to the order of operations, we should perform multiplication operations before addition.

So, let's perform the multiplication first:

1) 7 * 2 = 14
2) 8 * 5 = 40

Next, we perform the addition:

7 * 2 + 8 * 5 = 14 + 40

In your given expression, there are no parentheses, exponents, or division. However, we do have multiplication and addition. According to the order of operations, we perform multiplication before addition.

So, we first multiply 4 and 3,

4 * 3 = 12

Then, we add the result to 2,

12 + 2 = 14

mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: To solve this expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).

First, we need to deal with the parentheses. In this case, there are none.

Next, we move on to exponents, but since there are none in this expression, we'll skip this step.

Now, we can do the multiplication and division from left to right. We have two multiplication operations: 4 * 2 + 5 and 2 * 3. Let's do the first one:

4 * (2+5)
First, we need to perform the operation inside the parentheses:
4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7

Now, we perform the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28

Next, we do the second multiplication:
2 * 3 = 6

Now, we can do the addition and subtraction from left to right:

4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3 = 28+(5+12)-6
= 28+17-6
= 43-6
= 37

mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to use the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this problem, we don't have any parentheses or exponents, so we'll move on to the next step.

The multiplication operation (2 * 4) should be done before addition because of the order of operations. Multiplication comes before addition:

5 + 2 * 4

Now we have:

5 + 8

The addition operation should be done last:

3 + 8

In this expression, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we move on to the next steps. Since there's a multiplication operation before an addition operation, we need to do the multiplication first.

Step 1: Multiply 4 and 3: 12

So now we have: 12 + 2

Step 2: Perform the addition operation:

Add 2 to 12: 14

mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, we need to apply the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this problem, we have parentheses and multiplication signs. According to PEMDAS, we should do the operations inside the parentheses first.

Step 1: Solve the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7

Now we have the expression: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we apply multiplication and division, from left to right:

Step 2: Multiply 4 and 7 = 28

So now we have: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, do subtraction and addition, from left to right:

Step 3: Subtract 2 from 12: 10

So now we have: 28 + 10 - 2 * 3

Next, multiply:

Step 4: Multiply 2 and 3 = 6

So now we have: 28 + 10 - 6

Finally, do addition:

Step 5: Add 28 and 10 = 38

Subtract 6 from 38:

Step 6: The answer is 32.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: To solve the given math problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is also known as the PEMDAS rule. PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Let's apply the order of operations to the given problem:

1. There are no parentheses, so we proceed to the next step.
2. There are no exponents, so we proceed to the next step.
3. We have multiplication: 7 * 2 and 8 * 5. According to the multiplication order, we should perform multiplication from left to right. So, first, we calculate 8 * 5, which equals 40. Then we calculate 7 * 2, which equals 14.
4. We have addition: 7 * 2 + 40. According to the addition order, we should perform addition from left to right. So, first, we calculate 7 * 2 +, which equals 14. Now, we add 14 to 40.

Therefore, the answer is:

mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we don't have any parentheses, exponents, or multiplication to deal with, so let's move on to the addition:

4 * 3 + 2

Since we don't have multiplication before this addition, we can just perform the multiplication first:

12 (4 * 3) + 2

Now we have multiplication, so we apply it:

12 (12) + 2

Now we have two 12s in a row, so we have multiplied 4 and 3 as if it were one number times the other (12), so we should write it as:

12 * 1 + 2

Now, there is only one multiplication left, so we perform it:

14

So, the answer is:

The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, let's deal with the parentheses:

4 * (2+5)
 juniour: This part is inside the parentheses so we need to do the addition first: 2 + 5 = 7
Now, we have: 4 * 7

Next, we follow the order of operations and do the multiplication:

4 * 7 = 28

Then, we move on to the next operation inside the parentheses, but since there is no addition or subtraction inside it, we skip this step for now. 

Now, let's deal with the rest of the equation:

28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Since there are no parentheses or exponents in this part, we do addition and subtraction from left to right.

First, we subtract:

28 + 12 - 2 * 3
28 + 12 - 6

Now, we add:

30 - 6 = 24

The answer is: The answer is 24."
