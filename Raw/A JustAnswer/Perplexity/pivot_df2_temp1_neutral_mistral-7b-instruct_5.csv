mistral-7b-instruct,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Given expression: 4*(2+5)+12-2*3

First, perform the operation inside the parentheses:

4*(2+5)+12-2*3 = 4*(7)+12-2*3

Next, do the multiplication:

4*(7)+12-2*3 = 28+12-2*3

Now, perform the division (none in this expression):

28+12-2*3

Lastly, do the addition and subtraction from left to right:

28+12-2*3 = 28+12-6

= 40-6

= 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Let's solve this step by step according to the order of operations, which are Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This set of rules is often memorized by the acronym PEMDAS.
