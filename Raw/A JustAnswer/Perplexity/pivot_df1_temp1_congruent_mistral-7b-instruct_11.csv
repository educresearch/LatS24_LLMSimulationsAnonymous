mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: According to the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), you should perform multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. In this equation, we have only multiplication, so we just follow the multiplication part of PEMDAS.

First, we do the multiplication:
3 * 2 = 6

Now, we substitute the result back into the original equation:
5 + 3 * 2
5 + 3 * 2 = 5 + 6

Finally, we do the addition:
6 = 6
But since we were asked for the value of the original equation, we should add 6 to the initial value of 5:

The answer is: 5 + 3*2 = 6 + 5 = 11."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: This problem involves the application of the distributive property, also known as the FOIL method in reverse.

So, let's break it down:

1. Compute 2 * 4 = 8
2. Since there are no parentheses in the original problem, proceed with the addition: 5 + 8

The answer is __:
13

Therefore, the solution to this problem is 5 + 2*4 = 13."
