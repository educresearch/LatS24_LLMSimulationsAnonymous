mistral-7b-instruct,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: The expression given is: 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3

Let's solve it step by step using the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):

1. Parentheses: Solve the expression inside the parentheses first.
2 + 5 = 7
So, the expression becomes: 4*(7) + 12 - 2*3

2. Multiplication: Solve the multiplication operations from left to right.
4*7 = 28
So, the expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 2*3

3. Addition and Subtraction: Solve the addition and subtraction operations from left to right, starting with the sign.
12 - 2 = 10
So, the expression becomes: 28 + 10 - 2*3

4. Multiplication: Solve the last multiplication operation.
2*3 = 6
So, the expression becomes: 28 + 10 - 6

5. Addition and Subtraction: Solve the remaining addition and subtraction operations.
28 + 10 = 38
So, the expression becomes: 38 - 6

Therefore, the answer is: 32.

The answer is 32.","GPT Response: To solve the given expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is commonly remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Given expression: 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3

Following the order of operations:

1. Solve the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7

2. Multiply the results of the expression inside the parentheses by 4: 4 * 7 = 28

3. Next, we have two multiplication operations. We perform them from left to right:
   28 * 4 = 112
   12 * 3 = 36

4. Subtract the result of the last multiplication from the first multiplication: 112 - 36 = 76

The answer is: The answer is 76.","GPT Response: The order of operations, also known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), tells us the sequence in which we should perform different types of mathematical operations.

In this given expression- 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3, we need to follow PEMDAS to solve it.

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in this expression, so we'll move to the next step.
2. Exponents: We don't have any exponents, so we continue to the next step.
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right): There are two sets of multiplication and division operations- 4*(2 + 5) and 2*3. We'll perform multiplication before division according to the BIDMAS rule (in reversed order). So, we'll do the multiplication inside the parentheses first.

4 *(2 + 5)
= 4 * (2 + 5)
= 4 * (7)
= 4 * 7
= 28

Now, the expression looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2*3

1. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right): We'll perform addition before subtraction.

+12
-2*3

28 + 12 - 6

1. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right): We'll do the subtraction summand first in this final step since it's a subtraction operation.

28 + 12
-6

28 + 12 - 6
= 30 - 6

The answer is:

__
30

(The calculator or the given expression results should also be 30.)","GPT Response: To solve the given expression, we need to follow the order of operations which is also known as PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we'll deal with the parentheses:

4 * (2 + 5)

Since the parentheses are the only thing that fall under this category in our expression, we can move on to the next step:

4 * (7)

Multiplication comes before addition, so now we'll perform the multiplication:

28 (since 4 * 7 = 28)

Finally, we only have addition and subtraction left. Addition comes before subtraction, so we'll do it from left to right:

28 + 12

40 (result of adding 28 and 12)

Now, we only have subtraction left:

40 - 2 * 3

We need to follow the order of operations, which is subtraction from left to right as well. However, we're supposed to do multiplication before subtraction. So, we should first perform the multiplication:

6 (since 2 * 3 = 6)

Now we'll subtract 6 from the result of 40 we had before (which was the intermediate step before doing the multiplication):

34 (result of subtracting 6 from 40)

The answer is: __

The final answer is 34."
