mistral-7b-instruct,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

1. Solve the expressions inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7

2. Multiply: 4 * 7 = 28

3. Do addition and subtraction from left to right:
  28 + 12 = 40
  Subtract: 40 - 2 * 3

4. Multiply: 2 * 3 = 6

5. Subtract: 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Let's apply it to the given expression:

1. First, we deal with the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7. So the expression becomes 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

2. Next, we perform multiplications and divisions from left to right: 4 * 7 = 28, -2 * 3 = -6. So the expression becomes 28 + 12 - 6.

3. Finally, we perform additions and subtractions from left to right: Add 12 and 28, which equals 40. Subtract 6 from 40, the answer is:

Let's apply it to your problem:

1. First, solve the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7
2. Then, perform multiplication and division from left to right: 4 * 7 = 28; 2 * 3 = 6
3. Finally, perform addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40; 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we have parentheses, but in this problem, there are no parentheses. So, we move on to the next step.

Next, there are no exponents. So, we continue with multiplication and division. In this problem, we have the multiplication of 4 and the result of 2+5, and also the multiplication of 2 and 3. We perform these multiplications from left to right, given that there are no brackets to indicate a different order. So, we have:

4*(2+5) = 4*7 = 28
2*3 = 6

Now we have two smaller numbers, and we need to perform the addition and subtraction. Starting from left to right, we add and subtract:

28+12-6

So, we add 12 and 28, giving us 40. Then, we subtract 6. The final answer is:

The answer is __.
