systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In our problem, we have addition and multiplication. According to PEMDAS, we should do the multiplication first:

3 \* 2 = 6

So, the equation now becomes:

5 + 6

Next, we do the addition:

5 + 6 = 11

Therefore, the answer is 11."
