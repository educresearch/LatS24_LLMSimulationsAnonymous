systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: The order of operations in mathematics is represented by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). In your problem, there are no parentheses or exponents.

However, since there is a multiplication operation (3*2), we follow the third step of PEMDAS, which is:

Multiplication and Division (from left to right):
First, perform the multiplication: 3*2 = 6

Now, we substitute the result back into the original expression and perform the addition:

Addition and Subtraction (from left to right):
5 + 6

So, the answer is:

The answer is 11."
