      <td>GPT Response: Let's solve this step by step using the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction).<br><br>1. First, we do the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.<br>2. Now we have: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br>3. Next, we do multiplication and division from left to right: 4 * 7 equals 28 and 2 * 3 equals 6.<br>4. So now we have: 28 + 12 - 6<br>5.

      <td>GPT Response: Hello! I'd be happy to help you understand how to solve this problem using the order of operations. The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us the correct order to solve a math problem. It's often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>Now, let's apply the order of operations to the problem 5 + 2*4:<br><br>1. First, we look for any Parentheses or Exponents, but there are none in this problem.<br>2. Next, we move on to Multiplication and Division. We see that there is a 2 and a 4 that need to be multiplied together. So, we perform the multiplication first: 2 \* 4 = 8.<br>3. Finally, we move on to Addition and Subtraction. We see that we need to add 5 and 8. So, we perform the addition last: 5 + 8 = 13.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 13. The answer is 13.</td>
