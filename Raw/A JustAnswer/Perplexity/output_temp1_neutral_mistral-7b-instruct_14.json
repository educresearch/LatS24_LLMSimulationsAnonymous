Then we perform the multiplication outside the parentheses:\n\n  = 4 * 7 = 28\n\n5. Now, it's time for the addition and subtraction: We add and subtract from left to right. There is addition inside and outside parentheses. Let's compute it step by step:\n\n  = 28 + 12 = 40\n\n6. At last, we have only one remaining operation, which is subtraction. Let's perform this:\n\n  = 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34\n\nThe answer is 34."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500", "model": "mistral-7b-instruct", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 500, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in grade 6 learning order of operations for the first time.\n                    Explain your solution to this given Mathematics problem, and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "5+3*2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: To solve the problem 5 + 3 * 2, we need to follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nFirst, we need to take care of the multiplication: 3 * 2\nMultiply 3 by 2: 3 x 2 = 6\n\nNow, we add the result of the multiplication to the number outside the parentheses:\n5 + 6\n\nAdd 5 and 6: 11\n\nThe answer is: The answer is 11."}]}]
