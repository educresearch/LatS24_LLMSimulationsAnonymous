      <td>GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's how we can solve the problem step by step:<br><br>1. First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7<br>2. Next, we multiply 4 by the result of step 1: 4*7 = 28<br>3. Then, we add 12 to the result of step 2: 28 + 12 = 40<br>4. Finally, we subtract 2 times 3 from the result of step 3: 40 - 6 = 34<br><br>Therefore, the final answer is:<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's how I would solve the problem using the order of operations:<br><br>1. First, evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7<br>2. Next, multiply 4 by 7: 4*7 = 28<br>3. Then, add 12: 28 + 12 = 40<br>4. Finally, subtract 2 times 3: 40 - 6 = 34<br><br>The answer is 34.<br><br>Explanation:<br><br>The order of operations tells us to evaluate expressions inside parentheses first, so we start by adding 2 and 5 to get 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. Next, we add 12 to get 40. Finally, we subtract 2 times 3 to get 34. That's our final answer!</td>
