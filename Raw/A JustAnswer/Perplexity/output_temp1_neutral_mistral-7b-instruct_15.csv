systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this problem, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we start with multiplication and division. The multiplication comes before the addition in this expression because of the rule ""multiplication and division before addition and subtraction."" So, we will first do the multiplication: 3 multiplied by 2 equals 6. Now we have 5 plus 6.

Addition comes before subtraction in PEMDAS, so next we will add: 5 plus 6 equals 11.

The answer is 11."
