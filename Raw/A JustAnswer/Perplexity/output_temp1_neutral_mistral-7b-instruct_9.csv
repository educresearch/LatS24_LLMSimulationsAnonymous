systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this problem, we don't have any parentheses or exponents, but we do have multiplication (3*2) and addition (5+).

Since multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations, we should do the multiplication first.

So, the calculation becomes: 

5 + 3 * 2

Now, let's do the multiplication: 

5 + 3 * 2

5 + 3 * 2 = 5 + 6

Now we can do the addition:

5 + 6

The answer is: 

The answer is 11."
