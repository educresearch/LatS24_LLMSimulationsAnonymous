Finally, we do the remaining multiplication:

40 - 6

The answer is __.
40 - 6 = 34."

In this problem, we don't have any parentheses or exponents, so we'll move on to the next step.

The multiplication comes before the addition in the order of operations. So, we'll first do the multiplication:

3 * 2 = 6

Now that we've done the multiplication, we'll move on to the addition:

5 + 6

And the solution to this problem is:

The answer is 11."
