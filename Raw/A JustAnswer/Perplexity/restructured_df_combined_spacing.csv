The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply PEMDAS to the given expression:

4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3

1. Parentheses: inside the parentheses we have 2 + 5 = 7
2. Multiplication: 4*7 = 28
3. Addition and Subtraction: 28 + 12 = 40
4. Remaining multiplication: 40 - 2*3 = 40 - 6 = 34

* The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS helps us remember the order:
	+ P stands for ""Parentheses"" (if there are any)
	+ E stands for ""Exponents"" (if there are any)
	+ M stands for ""Multiplication""
	+ D stands for ""Division""
	+ A stands for ""Addition""
	+ S stands for ""Subtraction""
* In this problem, we have parentheses, so we follow them first. Inside the parentheses we have 2+5, which equals 7.
* Next, we multiply 4 by 7, which gives us 28.
* Then, we add 12, which brings us to 40.
* Finally, we subtract 2 times 3, which is 6, and we are left with 38.

1. First, I would evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses. In this case, we have:

4 * (2+5)

Using the order of operations, we know that we need to follow the following steps:

* Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 2+5 = 7
* Multiply 4 by 7: 4 * 7 = 28
2. Next, I would evaluate the rest of the expression outside the parentheses. In this case, we have:

12 - 2 * 3

Using the order of operations, we know that we need to follow the following steps:

* Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 2 * 3 = 6
* Subtract 6 from 12: 12 - 6 = 6
3. Now, I would combine the two expressions I've evaluated so far:

28 + 6

When solving the problem 7*2+8*5, we need to follow the order of operations. This means we need to perform the operations in the following order:

1. Multiply 7 and 2.
2. Multiply 8 and 5.
3. Add the two products.

The answer is: 14.","The order of operations, also known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction), tells us the sequence in which we should perform mathematical operations.

In this given problem (4*3+2), since there are no brackets or indices, the next rule is to perform multiplication and division from left to right. In this case, we have multiplication (4*3).

So, first, we multiply 4 and 3, which equals 12. Now we have 12 and 2 left for the addition operation (since addition is the last rule to follow according to the order of operations).

In this case, we want to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (also from left to right), a rule often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.

Here's how to apply the distributive property step-by-step to solve the expression 5 + 3*2:

1. According to PEMDAS, since there are no parentheses or exponents, we proceed to the next step: Multiplication.

2. Apply the distributive property: 5 + 3*2 = 5 + 3*2 + 0 (add 0 to both sides to get a common term, *2, for the distribution)

3. Now distribute the multiplication term 3 over each addition term: 

   5 + 3*2 = 5 + 3*2 + 0
          = 5 + 3*2 + 0
          = 5 + 3*2 + 0
          = 5 + 3*2 + 0

4. Complete the distribution:

        5 + 3*2 + 0
     = 5 + 3*2
     = 5 + 3*2 + 0
     = 5 + 3*2 + 0
     = 5 + 6*2

So now you have two multiplication terms: 3*2 and 1*2. Multiply each term:

First, we perform any operations inside Parentheses or Brackets, if there are any. Since there are none in this problem, we proceed to the next step.

Next, we deal with Indices (or Exponents) and/or Fractions, if any. In this problem, there are no indices or fractions, so we move on to the next step.
