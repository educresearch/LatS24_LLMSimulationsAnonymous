mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Let's solve this expression by following the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, according to parentheses rule, we calculate the sum inside the parentheses:

4 * (7) + 12 - 2*3

Next, we do multiplication:

28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, we do addition and subtraction from left to right:

39 - 6 = 33
