llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:

1. Parentheses (if there are any)
2. Exponents (if there are any)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply this order to the expression 5+2*4:

1. Parentheses: None
2. Exponents: None
3. Multiplication and Division: 2*4 = 8
4. Addition and Subtraction: 5 + 8 = 13

Therefore, the final answer is 13.

llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Sure! Here's how I would solve the problem using the order of operations:

1. First, follow the parentheses: inside the parentheses we have 2+5 = 7
2. Next, multiply 4 by 7 = 28
3. Then, add 12 = 40
4. Finally, subtract 2 times 3 = 38

The answer is 38.

Explanation:

The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:

P - parentheses (evaluate expressions inside parentheses first)
E - exponents (none in this case)
M - multiplication (evaluate multiplication next)
D - division (none in this case)
A - addition (evaluate addition next)
S - subtraction (evaluate subtraction last)

By following this order, we can ensure that we perform calculations correctly and avoid confusion. In this problem, we first evaluate the expression inside the parentheses (2+5), then multiply 4 by 7, then add 12, and finally subtract 2 times 3."
