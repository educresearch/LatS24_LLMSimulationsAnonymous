So, let's apply this to the given expression:

Given expression: 4*(2+5)+12-2*3

1. Solve the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7
2. Replace it in the given expression: 4*(7) + 12 - 2*3
3. Perform the multiplication: 4*7 = 28, 2*3 = 6
4. Replace the multiplication results in the expression: 28 + 12 - 6
5. Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40, 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is: The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, let's deal with the parentheses:

2 + 5 = 7

Now, we have: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we perform multiplication and division, from left to right:

4 * 7 = 28, and
2 * 3 = 6.

So, we have: 28 + 12 - 6

Now, we perform addition and subtraction, from left to right:

12 + 28 = 40, and
40 - 6 = 34.

Therefore,

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we take care of the parentheses:

4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we do the operation inside the parentheses:

4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3

Then, we perform multiplication and division from left to right:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Now, we do the multiplication:

28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Lastly, we do addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 39 (addition)
39 - 2 * 3 = 39 - 6

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 33.","GPT Response: To solve this mathematics problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction).

First, we will deal with the parentheses, if there were any in the given problem. In this case, there are no parentheses, so we move on to the next step.

Next, we will handle any exponents, if present. Since there are no exponents here, we proceed to the next step.

Now, we focus on the multiplication and division, from left to right. There are two multiplication operations in the problem: 4*(2+5) and 2*3. According to PEMDAS rule, we should perform multiplication and division in the order they appear left to right. So, let's calculate 2*3 first: 2*3 = 6. Now, we will do the multiplication inside the parentheses: 4* (2+5) = 4*7 = 28. Now, we put the result, 28, back in the place of the multiplication and replace it with the product: 4*(2+5) = 28.

Lastly, we will finish the problem by dealing with addition and subtraction, again from left to right. There are two addition and one subtraction in the problem: 28+12-2. Doing the addition first, we get 28+12 = 40. Then, we subtract 2 from 40 to get the final result: 40-2 = 38.

The answer is 38."
