Let's apply PEMDAS to the given problem:

1. Parentheses: We have parentheses in the given expression, which contain the sum of 2 and 5. We will calculate this sum first:
   2 + 5 = 7

2. Multiplication and Division: We don't have any exponents, multiplication or division signs yet, so we can skip this step for now.

3. Addition and Subtraction: We have an addition sign (4*), and a subtraction sign (2*-3), in that order. According to the PEMDAS rule, we perform these operations from left to right. So, we will subtract 2 from the result of the previous step, and then multiply:
   4*(7) = 28
   Then we will subtract 2:
   28 - 2 = 26

4. Multiplication and Division: We don't have any exponents, multiplication or division signs yet, so we can skip this step for now.

5. Addition and Subtraction: We have an addition sign (+) in the given expression. According to the PEMDAS rule, we perform additions and subtractions from left to right. So, we will add the result of the previous step to 12:
