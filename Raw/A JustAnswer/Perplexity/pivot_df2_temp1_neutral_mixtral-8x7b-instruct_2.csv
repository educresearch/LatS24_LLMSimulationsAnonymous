Given expression: 4*(2+5) + 12 - 2*3

First, perform the operation inside the parentheses:

4*(7) + 12 - 2*3

Next, do the multiplication:

28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, do addition and subtraction from left to right:

40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we should follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we do the operation inside the parentheses:

4 * (2 + 5) = 4 * 7 = 28

So the equation becomes:

28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we do multiplication:

2 * 3 = 6, so the equation becomes:

28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, we do addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40, and then 40 - 6 = 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: Let's solve this step by step using the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

1. First, solve the operation in the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7
2. Now, multiply: 4 * 7 = 28
3. Then, add: 28 + 12 = 40
4. Finally, multiply: 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, within the parentheses, we add 2 + 5 to get 7.

So the equation becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we do multiplication and division from left to right. We first multiply 4 * 7 to get 28.

So the equation becomes: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we do addition and subtraction from left to right. We first add 28 + 12 to get 40.

So the equation becomes: 40 - 2 * 3

Next, we do multiplication. We multiply 2 * 3 to get 6.

So the equation becomes: 40 - 6

Finally, we do subtraction. We subtract 6 from 40 to get 34.

So the answer is 34."
