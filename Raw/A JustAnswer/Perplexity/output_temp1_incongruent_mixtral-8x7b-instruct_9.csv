systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this problem, we have:

5 + 3 * 2

First, we do the multiplication, since it comes before addition in the order of operations:

5 + 6

Finally, we do the addition:

11

The answer is 11."
