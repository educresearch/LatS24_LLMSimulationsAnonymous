1. Parentheses: Inside the parentheses, add 2 + 5, which gives you 7.
   So the equation becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this equation.

3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right): Calculate 4 * 7, which gives you 28, and 2 * 3, which gives you 6.
   So the equation becomes: 28 + 12 - 6

4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right): First, add 28 + 12, which gives you 40, then subtract 6 from it.
   So the final answer is: 40 - 6

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure! The mathematical problem is: 4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3

","GPT Response: Hello! I'd be happy to help you understand how to solve the math problem you've given using the order of operations, also known as BIDMAS or PEMDAS. BIDMAS stands for Brackets, Indices (or Exponents), Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Let's take a look at the problem:

7 \* 2 + 8 \* 5

First, we need to identify the operations in the problem. We have two multiplication operations and one addition operation. According to BIDMAS, we should perform the multiplication operations before the addition.

So, let's start by multiplying 7 by 2:

7 \* 2 = 14

Now we have a new expression:

14 + 8 \* 5

Next, we need to multiply 8 by 5:

8 \* 5 = 40

Our expression now looks like this:

14 + 40

Finally, we need to perform the addition:

14 + 40 = 54

Therefore, the answer is:
