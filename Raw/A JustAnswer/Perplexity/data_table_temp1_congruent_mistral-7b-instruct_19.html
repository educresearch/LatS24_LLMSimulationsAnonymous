      <td>GPT Response: To solve this equation, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction. This means that we should first do anything inside parentheses, then any exponentions, after that multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction.<br><br>So, let's apply this to our problem 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3:<br><br>1. Inside the parentheses, we add 2 and 5: 2 + 5 = 7.<br>2. Multiply 4 by the result of the addition: 4 * 7 = 28.<br>3. Now we have to deal with two multiplication operations, so we perform the first one: 28 * 12 = 336.<br>4. Lastly, we subtract 2 * 3 from the result: 336 - (2 * 3) = 330.<br><br>So, the answer is: The answer is 330.</td>
