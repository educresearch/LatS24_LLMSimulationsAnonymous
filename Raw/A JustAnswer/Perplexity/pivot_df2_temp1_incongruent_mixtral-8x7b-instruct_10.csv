mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Let's solve the expression step by step, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), which means solving operations in this order: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

The expression given is:

4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3

First, let's do the operation inside the parentheses:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, perform multiplication:

28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, do addition and subtraction from left to right:

40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we should follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we do the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7

Then, we multiply: 4 * 7 = 28

Next, we add: 28 + 12 = 40

Lastly, we multiply: 2 * 3 = 6, and then subtract that result from the previous sum: 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Let's solve this step by step using the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction).

1. First, solve the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7
2. Now, multiply 4 by the result from step 1: 4 * 7 = 28
3. Next, add 12 to the result from step 2: 28 + 12 = 40
4. Then, multiply 2 by 3: 2 * 3 = 6
5. Finally, subtract the result from step 4 from the result from step 3: 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure! The mathematical expression you've given is: 4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3

To solve this, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, let's do the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.

So the expression becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we do multiplication and division from left to right. Multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. And multiply 2 by 3 to get 6.

So the expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, we do addition and subtraction from left to right. Add 28 and 12 to get 40. Then subtract 6 from 40.

So the answer is: 34."

Given expression: 4 * 3 + 2

First, perform multiplication: 12 + 2

Then, perform addition: 14

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: This mathematics problem follows the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this case, we have the expression 4 * 3 + 2.  Here, we need to follow the order of operations.  First, we perform the multiplication operation:

4 * 3 = 12

So now our expression is 12 + 2.  Finally, we perform the addition operation:

12 + 2 = 14

Therefore, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: When you have a math problem that includes more than one operation, you have to follow the order of operations. This means that you do certain operations before others. The order of operations is:

1. Parentheses (if any)
2. Exponents (if any)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

For the problem 4 * 3 + 2:

* There are no parentheses or exponents, so we can skip those steps.
* We are left with multiplication, addition, and a number. According to the order of operations, we should do the multiplication first. So we calculate 4 * 3 to get 12.
* Now we are left with the result of the multiplication (12) and a number (2), with an addition sign in between. According to the order of operations, we should do the addition last. So we add 12 + 2 to get 14.
