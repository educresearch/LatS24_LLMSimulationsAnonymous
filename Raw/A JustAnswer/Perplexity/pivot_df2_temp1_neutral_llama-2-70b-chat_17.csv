llama-2-70b-chat,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Sure! Here's how we can evaluate this expression:

4*(2+5) = 4*7 = 28

12 - 2*3 = 12 - 6 = 6

Therefore, the final answer is:

28 + 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Parentheses: inside the parentheses we have 2+5 = 7
2. Exponents (none in this case)
3. Multiplication: 4*7 = 28
4. Addition: 28 + 12 = 40
5. Subtraction: 40 - 2*3 = 40 - 6 = 34

Therefore, the answer is 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:

1. Parentheses (if there are any)
2. Exponents (if there are any)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply this order to the given expression:

4*(2+5)+12-2*3

First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 2+5 = 7

Now, we can multiply 4 by 7: 4*7 = 28

Next, we add 12: 28 + 12 = 40

Finally, we subtract 2 times 3: 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

The problem we're working on is 4*(2+5)+12-2*3.

The first step in solving this problem is to follow the order of operations. The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us which operations to perform first. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents (none in this case)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's start by evaluating the expressions inside the parentheses. We have 2+5=7 and 2*3=6.

Now, we can multiply 4 by 7: 4*7=28.

Next, we add 12: 28+12=40.

Finally, we subtract 6: 40-6=34.

The answer is 34.

Explanation:
The order of operations tells us to perform operations inside parentheses first, then exponents (if there are any), then multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right. In this problem, we have two multiplication operations, so we perform them in the order in which they appear from left to right. First, we multiply 7 and 2 to get 14, then we multiply 8 and 5 to get 40. Finally, we add 14 and 40 to get our final answer, 54.","GPT Response: Sure!
