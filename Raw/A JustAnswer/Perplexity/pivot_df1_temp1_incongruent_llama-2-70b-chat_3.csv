llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help!

The order of operations tells us to follow these steps:

1. Parentheses (if there are any)
2. Exponents (none in this case)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

So, let's follow these steps:

1. There are no parentheses, so we skip to step 2.
2. There are no exponents, so we skip to step 3.
3. We multiply 2 and 4, which gives us 8.
4. We add 5 and 8, which gives us 13.

Therefore, the answer is 13.

The answer is 13."

The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply this order to the problem 7 * 2 + 8 * 5:

1. Parentheses: None
2. Exponents: None
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right):
	* 7 * 2 = 14
	* 8 * 5 = 40
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right):
	* 14 + 40 = 54

Therefore, the answer is 54.

Explanation:
The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS (Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally) can help us remember the order:

1. Parentheses (if present)
2. Exponents (none in this case)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

So, in this problem, we first follow the parentheses and calculate 2+5 = 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7 = 28. Next, we add 12 = 40. Finally, we subtract 2 times 3 = 38."

When solving mathematical expressions, it's important to follow the Order of Operations, which is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform in what order. The acronym for the Order of Operations is PEMDAS:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

So, let's apply PEMDAS to the given expression:

4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3

First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 2+5 = 7

Now we can multiply 4 by 7: 4 * 7 = 28

Next, we add 12: 28 + 12 = 40

Finally, we subtract 2 times 3: 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
