mistral-7b-instruct,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3, follow the order of operations which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This rule is commonly known as PEMDAS.

First, we perform the operation inside the parentheses:

4*(2 + 5)  → 4*(7)

Next, we do the multiplication:

28

Lastly, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12  → 40
40 - 2*3 → 40 - 6

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve the given expression, follow the order of operations which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This set of rules is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.

First, we perform the operation inside the parentheses: 
    4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3

Now, we add the numbers inside the parentheses:
    4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we perform multiplication:
    4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Multiply:
    28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Now, we do subtraction from left to right. Since 2 * 3 = 6, we subtract that number from 12:
    28 + 12 - 6

Finally, add the remaining numbers:
    36

The answer is 36.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Let's apply this to your problem:

1. Solve the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7
So the expression becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

2. Perform any multiplication or division, working from left to right: 4 * 7 = 28
  So the expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3

3. Perform any addition or subtraction, working from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40
  So the expression becomes: 40 - 2 * 3

4. Perform the remaining multiplication: 3 * 2 = 6

However, in this case, we have addition and multiplication, not binomials. Let's break it down and apply the same concept.

First, we want to ensure that multiplication is done before addition. According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), multiplication should be performed before addition.

So, instead of adding 5 directly, we need to first find the product of 3 and 2, and then add 5 to that result.

Product of 3 and 2 = 3 * 2 = 6

Now, add that product to 5:
