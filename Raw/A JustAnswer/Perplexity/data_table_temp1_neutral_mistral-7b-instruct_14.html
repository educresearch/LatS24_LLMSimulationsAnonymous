      <td>GPT Response: To solve the given expression, we need to follow the order of operations which is commonly remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>Let's apply PEMDAS to the given expression: <br><br>1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in the expression, so we move on to the next step.<br>2. Exponents: There are no exponents in the expression, so we move on to the next step.<br>3. Multiplication and Division:<br>   First, we perform the multiplication inside the expression: <br>   4 * (2+5)<br>   Since we cannot perform multiplication before addition or subtraction according to the order of operations, we put this step aside for now.<br>   Then we perform the division inside the expression: <br>   12 - 2 * 3<br>   According to the order of operations, we should perform the division before subtraction. So,<br>   12 - 2 * 3  --> 12 - (2 * 3)<br>   12 - 6<br><br>4. Addition and Subtraction:<br>   Now we go back to the previous multiplication and perform it:<br>   4 * (2+5)  --> 4 * 7<br>   28<br>   28 + 12 - 6<br>   28 + 6 - 6<br>   30 - 6<br><br>5.

      <td>GPT Response: The order of operations in mathematics is also known as PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>Let's apply this order of operations to the given problem: 4 *(2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>1. First, we follow the rule for parentheses. In this problem, there are no parentheses, so we move on to the next rule.<br><br>2. The next rule in PEMDAS is exponents. But we don't have any exponents in this problem. The next rule is Multiplication and Division.<br><br>3. Multiplication and Division: We have two multiplication sign, one inside and one outside the addition. We should do the one inside parentheses first because of the rule "Multiplication and Division (from left to right)". Let's compute that first:<br><br>  4 * (2+5) = 4 * (7)<br><br>4. Then we perform the multiplication outside the parentheses:<br><br>  = 4 * 7 = 28<br><br>5. Now, it's time for the addition and subtraction: We add and subtract from left to right. There is addition inside and outside parentheses. Let's compute it step by step:<br><br>  = 28 + 12 = 40<br><br>6. At last, we have only one remaining operation, which is subtraction. Let's perform this:<br><br>  = 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
