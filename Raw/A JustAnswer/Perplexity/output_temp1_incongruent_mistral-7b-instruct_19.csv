systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: The order of operations in mathematics is called PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we need to follow the rule of parentheses. So, we look at the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5. We solve this addition problem: 2 + 5 = 7.

Now, we replace the parentheses with the number 7: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, we perform multiplication and division from left to right. We have two multiplication signs: 4 * 7 and 2 * 3. Let's do 2 * 3 first: 2 * 3 = 6. Then, we perform 4 * 7: 4 * 7 = 28.

Now our expression looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.

Next, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right: First, we add 12 to 28: 28 + 12 = 40. Then, we subtract 6 from 40: 40 - 6 = 34.

So, the answer is:

The answer is __.
The answer is 34."

In this problem, we don't have any parentheses or exponents, so we'll start with multiplication and division.

The multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations, so we need to do that first:

3 * 2 = 6

Now that we have the result of the multiplication, we can add the numbers:

5 + 6

And the final answer is:

The answer is 11."
