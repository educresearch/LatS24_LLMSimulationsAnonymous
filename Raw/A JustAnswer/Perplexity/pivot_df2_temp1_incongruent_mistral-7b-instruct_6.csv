mistral-7b-instruct,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: To solve this expression, follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Step 1: Solve the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7

Step 2: Multiply: 4 * 7 = 28

Step 3: Add and subtract: 28 + 12 = 40, 40 - 2 * 3 = 38

So the calculation is as follows: 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3 = 4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3 = 28 + 12 - 2 * 3 = 38 - 6 = 32

The answer is 32.","GPT Response: To solve this expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is commonly remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Let's apply this to the given expression:

1. First, perform the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7
2. Then, multiply: 4 * 7 = 28
3. Next, subtract: 12 - 2 = 10
4. Last, perform the final multiplication: 28 * 3 = 84

So, the answer is: The answer is 84.","GPT Response: First, we need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In your problem, there are parentheses, so we'll begin with that:

1. Solve the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7

Now that we've replaced the parentheses with 7, our expression looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we have multiplication inside the parentheses, so we'll do that:

2. Perform multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28, 2 * 3 = 6

Now our expression looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

Next, we'll do addition and finally subtraction, following the order from left to right:

3. Addition: 28 + 12 = 40

The answer is 40.","GPT Response: The order of operations in mathematics is called PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So, let's solve the given expression accordingly:

1. First, we have parentheses, which contain the expression 2 + 5. We solve it as follows:

   The sum of 2 and 5 is 7. So, our expression becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

2. Now, we have multiplication (4 * 7) and addition (4 * 7 + 12) inside the expression. according to PEMDAS, we should perform multiplication before addition:

   Multiply 4 and 7: 28.
   So, our expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.

3. We still have multiplication (2 * 3) inside the expression. So, we perform that next:

   Multiply 2 and 3: 6.
   So, our expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 6.

4. Now, we have addition and subtraction inside the expression. According to PEMDAS, we should perform subtraction before addition:

   Subtract 2 from 12: 10.
   So, our expression becomes: 28 + 10 - 6.

5. Finally, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right:

   Add 28 and 10: 38.
   Subract 6 from 38: 32.

The answer is __.32."
