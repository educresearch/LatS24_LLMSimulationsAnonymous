systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: When solving this problem, it is important to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this problem, we have the following expression: 5 + 3 * 2

First, we must do the multiplication:

3 * 2 = 6

So our expression now looks like this: 5 + 6

Finally, we do the addition:

5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11."
