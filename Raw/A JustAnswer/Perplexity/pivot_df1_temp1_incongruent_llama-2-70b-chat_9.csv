The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:

1. Parentheses (if there are any)
2. Exponents (if there are any)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Now, let's apply this order to the expression 5+2 * 4:

1. Parentheses: None
2. Exponents: None
3. Multiplication and Division: 2 * 4 = 8
4. Addition and Subtraction: 5 + 8 = 13

Therefore, the final answer is 13.

The answer is 13."

The answer is 54.

Explanation:
The order of operations tells us to perform multiplication before addition. So, we first multiply 7 and 2, then multiply 8 and 5, and finally add the two products together to get our final answer."

The problem is 5+2 * 4.

First, we need to follow the order of operations, which is PEMDAS:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

In this problem, we have parentheses, so we need to evaluate what's inside the parentheses first. Inside the parentheses, we have 2 * 4.

2 * 4 = 8

Now, we need to add 5 and 8.

5 + 8 = 13

So, the final answer is 13.

The answer is 13."

When we have multiple operations in an expression, we need to follow the Order of Operations to ensure we perform the calculations in the correct order. The acronym for the Order of Operations is PEMDAS:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply PEMDAS to the given expression:

7 * 2 + 8 * 5

Step 1: Parentheses

There are no parentheses in the expression, so we can move on to the next step.

Step 2: Exponents

There are no exponents in the expression, so we can move on to the next step.

Step 3: Multiplication and Division (from left to right)

We have two multiplication operations: 7 * 2 and 8 * 5. We need to perform these operations from left to right.

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Step 4: Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

We have one addition operation: 14 + 40.

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 54."
