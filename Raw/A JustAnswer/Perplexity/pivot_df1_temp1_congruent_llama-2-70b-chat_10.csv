llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

The problem we're given is 5 + 2*4. To solve this, we need to follow the order of operations, which tells us to evaluate expressions inside parentheses first. In this case, we have 2*4 inside parentheses, so we need to evaluate that first.

2*4 = 8

Now, we can proceed to add 5 and 8:

5 + 8 = 13

Therefore, the answer is 13.

llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Sure! Here's how to solve the problem using the order of operations:

1. Multiply 2 and 4: 2*4 = 8
2. Add 5 and 8: 5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.

Explanation:

The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS helps us remember the order:

1. Parentheses (if there are any)
2. Exponents (if there are any)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

In the expression 5 + 2*4, we first multiply 2 and 4, because multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations. Then, we add 5 and 8, because addition comes after multiplication. Finally, we get our result, which is 13."

1. Multiply 4 and 3: 4 Ã— 3 = 12
2. Add 2: 12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.

Explanation:
The order of operations tells us to perform multiplication before addition. So, we multiply 4 and 3 first, which gives us 12. Then, we add 2 to 12, which gives us 14. That's our final answer!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's how we can solve this problem using the order of operations:

1. First, we need to follow the parentheses. In this case, we have 2 + 5 inside parentheses, so we need to evaluate that expression first.
2 + 5 = 7
2. Next, we need to multipylastic number outside the parentheses by the number inside the parentheses. In this case, we have 4 multiplied by 7.
4 * 7 = 28
3. Now, we need to move on to the next operation, which is addition. We have 12 added to 28.
28 + 12 = 40
4. Finally, we have subtraction. We have 40 minus 2 times 3.
40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.

Explanation:

* First, we evaluate the expression inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5 = 7.
* Next, we multiply 4 by 7 = 28.
* Then, we add 12 to 28 = 40.
* Finally, we subtract 2 times 3 from 40 = 34.

Therefore, the final answer is 34."
