systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 5 + 3 * 2, we need to follow the Order of Operations, which is also known as PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this problem, we don't have any parentheses or exponents to deal with first. However, we do have multiplication (3 * 2), which comes before addition in the order of operations. So let's take care of the multiplication first:

3 * 2 = 6

Now we are left with 5 and 6, which we need to add:

5 + 6 = 11

So the final answer is:

The answer is 11."
