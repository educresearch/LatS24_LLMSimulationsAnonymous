mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is commonly remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this case, there are no parentheses or exponents, but we do have multiplication and addition. According to the multiplication-before-addition rule (or the ""BIDMAS""/BODMAS variant), we should perform multiplication before addition.

So, we start by multiplying the numbers within the multiplication sign:

4 * 3 = 12

Now, we add the result of the multiplication to the number inside the addition sign:

12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14."

So in this expression: 4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3

First, calculate the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7

Then, do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28

Now, perform the remaining addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40, and 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: This is an example of the distributive property, also known as the FOIL method in reverse. According to the property, when multiplying a sum by a constant, you need to multiply each term in the sum separately by the constant and then add the results.

Applying the distributive property, we get:

5 + 3 * 2
= 5 + (3 * 2)
= 5 + (3 * 2)
= 5 + (6)
= 5 + 6
= 11

The answer is 11."

In your expression, there are no parentheses or exponents.

In this case, we have two multiplication operations: 7*2 and 8*5. Since both are multiplication operations, we perform them before the addition operation. We'll start by multiplying 7 and 2, which gives us 14. Then, we'll multiply 8 and 5, which gives us 40. Now we have the values 14 and 40, which we'll substitute back into the expression and perform the addition:

7*2 + 8*5 = 14 + 40 = 54

In this case, since there are no parentheses, exponents, or division in the expression, we only need to follow the rule for multiplication and addition. Accordingly, the multiplication operation (4*3) should be done before the addition operation (4*3 + 2).

So, we start by performing the multiplication:

4 * 3 = 12

Now, we substitute the result of the multiplication operation back into the original expression, and perform the addition operation:

12 + 2 = 14

Let's apply this order to the given expression:

1. Parentheses: We have only one pair of parentheses, which contains the expression 2 + 5. We evaluate this expression first: 2 + 5 = 7.

2. Multiplication and Division: None of these operations is present in our expression at the moment.

3. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right):We have two additions (4 * 7 + 12) and one subtraction (-2 * 3) from left to right.

First, we do the multiplication inside the addition: 4 * 7 = 28.

Now we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:

mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: The order of operations in mathematics is known as PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). In the given problem, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we'll advance to the next step.

Since there is a multiplication operation, we need to perform that before the addition according to PEMDAS rule. So, we first calculate 2*4, which equals 8.

Now, we have the value 5 + 8. The addition operation is the last step according to the PEMDAS rule, so we simply add 5 and 8, which equals 13.
