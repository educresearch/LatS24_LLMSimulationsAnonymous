In our problem, we have neither parentheses nor exponents. So we move on to the first step that has multiplication:

1. Multiply 3 and 2 to get 6.

Now our problem looks like this: 5 + 6

Next, we do addition (since there are no multiplication or division operations left to do before it):

2. Add 5 and 6 to get 11.

So,

The answer is 11."
