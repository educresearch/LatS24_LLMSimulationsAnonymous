mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: The order of operations in mathematics is commonly remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Given the expression 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3, the first step is to deal with the parentheses:

1. Solve the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7
2. Replace the parentheses with 7: 4*7 + 12 - 2*3

Next, perform any multiplication or division, from left to right:

1. Multiply the numbers outside the parentheses: 4*7 = 28
2. Multiply 2 and 3: 2*3 = 6
3. Do subtraction if there are any negative signs or if the problem instructs you to: No, so leave it as is for now: 28 + 12 - 6

Finally, do addition and subtraction from left to right:

1. Add 12 and 28: 40
2. Subtract 6: 34

mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: The problem 5 + 2*4 follows the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we focus on the multiplication part of the expression which is 2 * 4. According to the order of operations, we should do the multiplication before addition. So, we calculate 2 * 4 = 8.

Next, we substitute the result of the multiplication in the expression, so it becomes 5 + 8.

Now, we move on to the addition part of the expression. According to the order of operations, we should add from left to right. Here, we have only 2 addends, so we add 5 and 8. Therefore, the sum of 5 and 8 is 13.

To sum up, the solution to the given mathematical problem 5 + 2*4 follows the order of operations PEMDAS, and the final answer is the result of following the rules:

5 + 2 * 4
