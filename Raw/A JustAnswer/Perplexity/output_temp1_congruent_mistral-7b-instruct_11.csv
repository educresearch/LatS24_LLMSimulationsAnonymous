systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this problem, we do not have any parentheses or exponents. But we do have multiplication (3*2) and addition (5 +).

We cannot directly add 5 and the result of the multiplication 3*2 because of the order of operations rule. Instead, we need to perform the multiplication first and then add the results.

Let's calculate the multiplication step:
3*2 = 3 x 2 = 6

Now we have 5 + 6. No more multiplication or addition inside the parentheses, so we just need to add those numbers:

5 + 6 = 11

The answer is:

The answer is 11."
