      <td>GPT Response: Let's solve this step by step:<br><br>1. First, we need to do the operations inside the parentheses, which is addition in this case: 2 + 5 equals 7.

Next, we follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). So, we do the multiplications: 4 * 7 equals 28 and 2 * 3 equals 6. Our equation now looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6<br><br>3. Finally, we do the additions and subtractions from left to right: 28 + 12 equals 40 and 40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
