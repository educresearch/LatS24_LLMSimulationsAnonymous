llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Sure, I can help you with that!

The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS can help us remember the order:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's apply PEMDAS to the expression 5+2 * 4:

1. Parentheses: None
2. Exponents: None
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right): 2 * 4 = 8
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right): 5 + 8 = 13

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

The order of operations tells us to follow these steps:

1. Parentheses (if there are any)
2. Exponents (if there are any)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

So, let's apply this to our problem:

7 * 2 + 8 * 5

Step 1: Multiply 7 and 2
7 * 2 = 14

Step 2: Multiply 8 and 5
8 * 5 = 40

Step 3: Add 14 and 40
14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.

Therefore, the final answer is 54."
