systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this problem, we have neither parentheses nor exponents, so we move to the next step in PEMDAS which is Multiplication and Division. We see the number 3 getting multiplied by 2. So we do that first:

3 * 2 = 6

Now our expression looks like this: 5 + 6

The remaining operations are Addition, so we do that next:

5 + 6 = 11

Therefore, the answer is 11."
