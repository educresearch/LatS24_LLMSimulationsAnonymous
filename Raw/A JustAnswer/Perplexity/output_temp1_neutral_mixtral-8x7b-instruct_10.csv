systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In our problem, we have neither parentheses nor exponents. So, we move on to multiplication and division. We see the number 3 being multiplied by 2. So, we perform that operation first.

3 * 2 = 6

Now, our equation looks like this:

5 + 6

Lastly, we have addition. So, we perform that operation.

5 + 6 = 11

Therefore, the answer is 11."
