mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Let's solve this expression by following the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, solve the operation in the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7

Then, multiply: 4 * 7 = 28

Next, add: 28 + 12 = 40

Finally, subtract: 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

1. First, we need to do the operations inside the parentheses, which is addition in this case: 2 + 5 equals 7. So now our equation looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3
2. Next, we follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). So, we have to do the multiplications and divisions before the additions and subtractions. 4 times 7 equals 28, and 2 times 3 equals 6. So now our equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6
3. Finally, from left to right, we do addition and subtraction. 28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 6 equals 34.

At first glance, it seems like we have two multiplication operations and one addition operation. However, multiplication and addition have the same level of precedence in PEMDAS, so we should solve from left to right.

1. First, we perform the multiplication operation on the left: 7 * 2 = 14.
2. Now our expression becomes: 14 + 8 * 5.
3. Next, we perform the remaining multiplication operation: 8 * 5 = 40.
