llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Sure! Here's how I would solve this problem using the order of operations:

1. Multiply 4 and 3: 4*3 = 12
2. Add 2: 12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.

Explanation:
The order of operations tells us to perform operations inside parentheses first, then exponents, then multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right. In this problem, we have a multiplication and an addition. We simplify the multiplication first, which gives us 12, and then add 2 to get 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Sure! Here's how I would solve this problem using the order of operations:

1. First, I would evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7
2. Next, I would multiply 4 by 7: 4*7 = 28
3. Then, I would add 12: 28 + 12 = 40
4. Finally, I would subtract 2 times 3: 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.

Explanation:

The order of operations is a set of rules that tell us which operations to perform first when we have multiple operations in an expression. The acronym PEMDAS helps us remember the order:

1. Parentheses: Evaluate expressions inside parentheses first.
2. Exponents: None in this case.
3. Multiplication and Division: Evaluate from left to right.
4. Addition and Subtraction: Evaluate from left to right.

By following this order, we can simplify the expression 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3 to get the final answer of 34."
