llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I know how to do the problem. So, we have 5 plus 2 times 4, right?

First, I think we should do the multiplication because it's inside the parentheses, like my teacher says. So, 2 times 4 is 8.

Next, we add 5 and 8, and that gives us 13.

So, the answer is 13!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Hi there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure how to do this problem. Can you help me?

Okay, so I know that when we have multiplication and addition in a problem, we do the multiplication first. That's what my teacher told me.

So, let's do the multiplication part. 7*2 is 14, and 8*5 is 40.

Now, we add 14 and 40, and that gives us... hmm... 54!

The answer is 54! ðŸ˜Š"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll do the multiplication first.
4*3 is 12.

Now, I add 2 to 12, and I get 14.

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?

Okay, so I know that 2 + 5 = 7, and 7 * 4 = 28.

Then, 12 - 2 * 3 = 12 - 6 = 6.

So, the answer is 28 + 6 = 34.

The answer is 34."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Hey, I'm just a grade 6 student, and I'm not really sure about this order of operations thing. But I think we're supposed to follow some rules to make sure we get the right answer. So, let's see...

First, I think we should do the multiplication because it says ""3*2"" before the addition symbol. That means we need to multiply 3 and 2, which gives us 6.

Next, we have the addition symbol, so we add 5 and 6. That gives us 11.

So, the answer is 11.

The answer is 11."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll give it my best shot!

So, 5 + 2*4... hmmm... I think I should start by multiplying 2 and 4 because that's what the multiplication symbol () means, right? So that's 8.

Now, I have 5 + 8... oh wait, I think I need to add 5 and 8! So, 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Oh no! I'm not sure how to do this problem. I know I need to multiply the numbers, but I'm not sure what to do first. I think I'll just do the multiplication in my head and see what happens.

7*2 is 14.
8*5 is 40.

Okay, so now I have 14 and 40. I'm not sure what to do next. I think I'll just add them together.

14 + 40 = 54.

The answer is 54.

I hope that's right! I'm not really sure what I'm doing. Maybe I'll learn how to do this properly in class tomorrow."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?

Okay, I think I know how to do it now. So, we have 4*3 which is 12, right? And then we have 2. If we add them together, we get 14.

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not really sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

Okay, so the first thing I see is 4*2, which is 8. Then there's a plus sign and a 5, so that's 8 + 5, which is 13.

Next, I see a plus sign and a 12. That's easy, 13 + 12 is 25.

Now, there's a minus sign and a 2*3. I'm not sure what to do here. I think I'm supposed to multiply 2 and 3 first, so that's 6. Then I subtract 6 from 25, and that gives me 19.

The answer is 19."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But let's see, we have 5 + 3*2... hmmm... okay, I think I know how to do this!

First, we have 5 + 3, that's easy, it's 8. Then we have 8 * 2, that's also easy, it's 16. So, the answer is 16!

The answer is 16."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this problem...

Okay, I know I have to follow some steps to solve it. I remember my teacher saying something about PEMDAS. I think it means we have to do things in a special order.

First, I see a 5. That's easy, I know what to do with a 5! I'll write it down.

Next, I see a 2. Hmm, what do I do with a 2? Oh yeah, I have to multiply it by something. I see a 4 right after it, so I'll multiply 2 and 4 together. That's 8!

Now, I have 5 and 8. I have to add them together. 5 + 8 is 13!

The answer is 13.

(And that's how I, as an elementary school student who knows nothing about order of operations, would solve the problem 5 + 2*4 using PEMDAS!)"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know I have to do the multiplication first, so I'll start by multiplying 7 and 2. That gives me 14.

Next, I have to multiply 8 and 5, which gives me 40.

Now, I have to add 14 and 40, which gives me 54.

The answer is 54!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Well, I don't know what this PEMDAS thing is, but I can try to solve the problem.

First, I see a multiplication sign, so I know I need to do that first.
4 x 3 = 12

Oh, there's a plus sign too! Let's see... 2 + 12 = 14

So, the answer is 14!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

So, we have 4 groups of something, and each group has 2 + 5 things in it. That means we have 4 groups of 7 things altogether.

Then, we have 12 more things that we need to add to that total.

But wait, there's a minus sign! That means we need to take away something. We need to take away 2 groups of 3 things from the total.

Okay, so let's see... 4 groups of 7 things is 28 things. Then we add 12 more things, that's 40 things. Oops, wait, we need to take away 2 groups of 3 things, that's 6 things.

So, the final answer is 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I think I can help you with that math problem!

So, 5 + 3*2... hmmm... first, let's do the multiplication. 3 times 2 is 6, right?

So, now we have 5 + 6... oh, I know! We have to add 5 and 6! That's 11!

The answer is 11! ðŸ˜Š"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what the * means. Can you help me?

Oh, you're saying that * means multiplication? Okay, so 2*4 means 2 times 4, which is 8.

So, 5 + 8 is 13.

The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Okay, so we have two parts to this problem: 7*2 and 8*5.

First, let's do 7*2. That's easy, it's just 7 groups of 2, so that's 14.

Now, let's do 8*5. That's a little harder, but we can count up 8 groups of 5 and that's 40.

Now, we add 14 and 40 and that's... hmm... 54!

The answer is 54."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Okay, let's see... 4*3 is 12, and then we add 2, so that's 14. The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Okay, let's see...

First, we need to do the addition inside the parentheses. That's 2 + 5, which equals 7.

Next, we multiply 4 by 7, and that gives us 28.

After that, we add 12 to 28, and that gets us 40.

Finally, we subtract 2 times 3, which is 6.

So, the final answer is... 40 - 6 = 34!

The answer is 34."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, but I don't know why. I just know that's the rule. So, I'll do the multiplication first. 3*2 = 6. Now, I add 5 to 6 and get 11. The answer is 11."
