      <td>GPT Response: Sure, I'll do my best to answer this math question as a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about order of operations yet.<br><br>At first glance, this problem looks a bit confusing because it has addition, subtraction, and multiplication all mixed together. But I know that I can do the operations inside the parentheses first. So I'll start by adding 2 + 5, which equals 7.<br><br>Now the problem looks like this: 4 \* 7 + 12 - 2 \* 3.<br><br>Next, I see that there are still some multiplication and addition left to do. I don't know about order of operations yet, so I'll just do the multiplication and addition from left to right.<br><br>First, I'll do 4 \* 7, which equals 28.<br><br>Now the problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2 \* 3.<br><br>Next, I'll do the addition, which gives me 40.<br><br>Now the problem looks like this: 40 - 2 \* 3.<br><br>Finally, I'll do the remaining multiplication, which is 2 \* 3, which equals 6.<br><br>Now the problem looks like this: 40 - 6.<br><br>To finish up, I'll do subtraction, which gives me 34.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>

So I would add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then I would multiply 7 by 4 to get 28. But I've made a mistake because I should have followed the order of operations, which means I should have done the multiplication before the addition. If I follow the correct order, I would first multiply 2 by 4 to get 8, and then add 5 to get 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, as a 6th grade student who doesn't know about order of operations, I would first think of doing the addition and multiplication from left to right. So I would add 5 and 2 to get 7, and then multiply that result by 4. Doing this, I get 28. But I've seen my older brother doing math in a different way, and he said something about "PEMDAS". I think I should follow that rule instead, which means I should do the multiplication before the addition. So I should multiply 2 by 4 to get 8, and then add 5. Doing this, I get 13. The answer I first got was 28, but using order of operations, the answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I don't know about any order of operations rule, so I will just solve this from left to right. First, I will do the addition:<br><br>5 + 2 = 7<br><br>Now, I will multiply 7 by 4:<br><br>7 * 4 = 28<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I don't know much about this order of operations thing, but I can try to solve this problem as best I can. <br><br>First, I see the numbers 5 and 2 with a plus sign, so I think I should add them together. Then, I see the result of that, which is 7, and next to it there's a 2 and a 4 with a times sign. I think I'm supposed to multiply those two numbers together.<br><br>So, if I follow those steps, I get:<br><br>5 + 2*4 = 7 + 8 = 15<br><br>The answer is 15.</td>
