      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so if I was in 6th grade and didn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would probably solve this problem from left to right. But that's not the correct way to do it. Instead, I need to follow the order of operations: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>First, I'll do the operation in the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.<br><br>So, the expression becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Now, I'll do the multiplication and division from left to right: 4 * 7 equals 28 and 2 * 3 equals 6.<br><br>So, the expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Lastly, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 equals 40 and 40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hi! I'm a grade 6 student and I don't know about order of operations (PEMDAS) yet. But, I'll try my best to solve this problem.<br><br>First, I will do the addition inside the first parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.<br>Then, I will multiply 4 by 7, since multiplication is next in line. That gives 28.<br>Next, I will add 12 to 28, which results in 40.<br>Finally, I will multiply 2 by 3 and subtract that result from 40. So, 2 times 3 equals 6, and 40 minus 6 is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: I don't know about any special rules for solving math problems, so I'll just do them in order from left to right, just like reading. <br><br>First, I'll do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.<br><br>So now it's 4 \* 7 + 12 - 2 \* 3.<br><br>Next, I'll multiply: 4 \* 7 = 28 and 2 \* 3 = 6.<br><br>So it's 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Then addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40, and 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm a student in grade 6 and I don't know about the order of operations in Mathematics. But I think to solve this, I can do the multiplication and addition part by part.

But then, I would get a wrong answer.<br><br>So, even without knowing the order of operations rule, I would still follow what seems to make sense and give the same answer as someone who knows the rule.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, as a student in elementary school, I would first solve the multiplication problems separately, since that's what we've learned so far. So, I would multiply 7 times 2 to get 14, and then multiply 8 times 5 to get 40. Then, I would add those two results together because we do addition and subtraction after multiplication and division. So, I would add 14 and 40 to get 54. Therefore, the answer is 54.</td>
