llama-2-70b-chat,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you explain it to me?

Oh, you want me to try and solve it anyway? Okay, let's see...

4 * 7 + 12 - 6... um... that's 28... no, wait, that's not right.

Let me start again.

4 * 7 + 12... that's 28...

Wait, what's the question again?

Oh, okay. 28 - 6 is 22.

The answer is 22.

Is that right?","GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

Okay, so the first thing I see is 4 multiplied by something. That something is 2+5, which is 7. So, 4 times 7 is 28.

Next, there's this thing that says 12 minus 2 times 3. That's easy, 12 minus 6 is 6.

Now, I have 28 and 6. I'm not sure what to do with them, but I think I should add them together. So, 28 + 6 is 34.

The answer is 34.

I hope that's right!","GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know I have to follow some rules to solve this problem, but I'm not sure what they are. I think I have to do the things inside the parentheses first, so I'll start by adding 2 and 5. That's easy, it's 7!

Next, I have to multiply 4 by 7. That's also easy, it's 28!

Then, I have to subtract 2 times 3. That's 6.

Finally, I add 12 and 6, and that gives me... 18!

The answer is 18.","GPT Response: Okay, I'll give it a try!

First, I see some numbers and signs that I know how to work with. Let's start with the addition part inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.

Next, I see the multiplication symbol, which means I need to multiply 4 and 7. That gives me 28.

Now, I see a subtraction sign and the number 2. I know I need to subtract 2 from 28, so that gives me 26.

Finally, I see the last addition sign and the number 12. Adding 12 to 26 gives me 38.

The answer is 38!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?

Okay, let me think...I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I think I should do the multiplication first. So, 4 * 3 is 12.

Now, I have 12 + 2, which is 14.

So, the answer is 14.

Is that right?","GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. I think it has something to do with rules for doing math problems, but I'm not sure what the letters stand for. Can you help me?

Oh, you want me to try and solve it? Well, okay. I think I would do it like this: 4 * 3 = 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what this ""PEMDAS"" thing is, but I'll do my best to solve the problem!

First, I see a multiplication sign, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 3. That gives me 12.

Next, I see a plus sign, so I'll add 2 to 12. That gives me 14.

So, the answer is 14!

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do multiplication before addition, but I don't know why. My teacher just says it's the way it is. So, I'll do the multiplication first.

4 * 3 = 12

Now, I have 12 + 2. Hmm, I know I'm supposed to add 2 to 12, but I don't know why. My teacher just says it's the way it is. So, I'll add 2 to 12.

12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to follow some rules to solve this problem, but I don't know what they are. I think I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, so I'll do that.

2 * 4 = 8

Now, I need to add 5 and 8.

5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it my best shot.

So, the problem is 5+2 * 4, right? I think we should start by adding 5 and 2, that's easy, it's 7.

Now, there's this thing called multiplication, and it looks like we need to multiply 4 by something. I'm not sure what that means, but I think it means we need to add 4 a bunch of times. Like, 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16.

So, if we add 7 and 16, we get 23.

The answer is 23.","GPT Response: Hmm, let me think... Okay, I know that when we add numbers, we do it from left to right. So, first, I'll add 5 and 2, and that gives me 7.

Now, I see that there's a multiplication sign. I'm not sure what it does, but I think it means we have to do something special. I remember my teacher saying something about multiplying numbers together. So, I'll multiply 4 and 2, and that gives me 8.

Now, I have two numbers: 7 and 8. I'm not sure what to do with them. I think I need to add them together. So, I'll add 7 and 8, and that gives me 15.

The answer is 15.","GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem, but I think we have to follow some rules.

First, let's add 5 and 2. That's easy, it's 7.

Now, we have to multiply 4 by something. I think it's 7, because that's what we just got.

So, 7 x 4 = 28.

The answer is 28."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm not really sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it my best shot.

Okay, so we have 5 + 3 * 2. I know that 3 * 2 is 6, so that's easy.

Then, we have 5 + 6, which is 11.

The answer is 11.

I hope that's right! Do I get a cookie now?","GPT Response: Hi there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

So, the problem is 5+3 * 2. I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll start by multiplying 3 and 2. That gives me 6.

Next, I'll add 5 and 6, which gives me 11.

The answer is 11.

I hope that's correct! Can you tell me if I did it right?","GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that when we add numbers, we do it from left to right. So, first, I'll add 5 and 3, and that gives me 8.

Next, I see that there's a multiplication sign. I'm not really sure what that means, but I think it means we have to do the multiplication before we do anything else. So, I'll multiply 8 by 2, and that gives me... (pauses for a moment) ...16!

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Okay! Let's see... 5 + 3 is 8, and 8 * 2 is 16. So, the answer is 16.

The answer is 16."

So, the problem is 7 * 2 + 8 * 5, right? I think I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, so I'll start with the 7 * 2. That's easy, it's just 14.

Next, I have to add 8 * 5. Hmm, that's a bit trickier. I know I need to do the multiplication again, so I'll do 8 * 5 and that gives me 40.

Okay, so now I have 14 + 40, which is... (drumroll please)... 54!

The answer is 54!","GPT Response: Hi there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure how to solve this problem. I know I need to follow some rules, but I don't know what they are. Can you help me?

Okay, I know that when we have addition and multiplication in a problem, we need to do the multiplication first. That's what my teacher said.

So, let's start by multiplying 7 and 2. That gives us 14.

Next, we need to multiply 8 and 5. That gives us 40.

Now, we need to add 14 and 40. That gives us 54.
