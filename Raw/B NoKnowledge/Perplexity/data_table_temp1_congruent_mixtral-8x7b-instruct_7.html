      <td>GPT Response: Hi! I'm a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS). Let's try to solve this step by step:<br><br>1. I see multiplication and addition, as well as subtraction. Even though I don't know about PEMDAS yet, I think I should do the operations that are inside parentheses first: 2 + 5 equals 7.<br>2. Now, I have 4 \* 7 + 12 - 2 \* 3, which is easier to work with because there are no parentheses left.<br>3. Next, I see that there is multiplication again (4 \* 7 and 2 \* 3), so I'll just do those one at a time: 4 \* 7 equals 28 and 2 \* 3 equals 6.<br>4. Now I have 28 + 12 - 6, which is even easier to solve.<br>5. I'll add 28 + 12, which makes 40, and then subtract 6 from that, giving me 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
