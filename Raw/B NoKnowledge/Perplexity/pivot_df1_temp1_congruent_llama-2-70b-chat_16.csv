llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?

Okay, let me think... There's a 5 and a 2 and a 4. If I add 5 and 2, that's 7. Then if I multiply 7 by 4, that's 28.

The answer is 28."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?

Okay, so I know that 7*2 is 14, and 8*5 is 40. Now, I'm not sure what to do next.

Oh, I know! I think I need to add 14 and 40 together. So, 14 + 40 = 54.

The answer is 54."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 3. That gives me 12.

Next, I have 2 left over, so I'll add that to 12.

The answer is 14.

Can you check that for me, teacher?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you explain it to me?

Oh, you want me to try and solve it anyway? Okay, let's see...

I think I should start by adding 2 and 5 because they're close together. That gets me 7.

Next, I should multiply 4 by 7 because it's in parentheses. That gives me 28.

Then, I should add 12 to 28 because it's the next number in the problem. That gives me 40.

Finally, I should subtract 2 times 3 because it's the last thing in the problem. That gets me 38.

The answer is 38.

Is that right? Did I do it correctly? Can you please explain PEMDAS to me now?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Hey there! Let's see... 5 + 3*2... Hmm... I know I have to follow some rules, but I'm not sure what they are. I think I'll just do it in the order that makes sense to me.

Okay, so first, I'll do the multiplication: 3*2 = 6.

Then, I'll add 5 and 6: 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But let's give it a try!

Okay, so we have 5 + 2*4. I know that 2*4 is 8, so I'll write that down.

5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm supposed to solve this math problem, huh? Okay, let's see...

First, I notice that there are lots of numbers and symbols in the problem. I'm not really sure what to do with all those stars and plus signs, but I think I'm supposed to follow some rules or something.

I see that there are two numbers that are multiplied together, 7 and 2. I know how to do that! I can just multiply them together and get 14.

But then there's this other number, 8, and it's multiplied by 5. That's a bit tricky, but I think I can handle it. I multiply 8 and 5 and get 40.

Now, I'm not sure what to do next. Do I add 14 and 40? Or do I do something else? Hmm...

Oh, wait! I remember something my teacher said. She said that when you have lots of operations in a problem, you're supposed to follow a special order. It's like a secret code or something.

Okay, so I think the order goes like this: first, you do the multiplication, then you do the addition. Or is it the other way around? Hmm...

Well, I'll just try it both ways and see what happens.

So, if I do the multiplication first, that means I multiply 7 and 2, and then I multiply 8 and 5. That gives me 14 and 40.

Then, if I add 14 and 40, that gives me 54.

But wait, what if I do the addition first? That means I add 7 and 2, and then I add 8 and 5. That gives me 9 and 13.

Hmm... that doesn't seem right. I think I did something wrong.

Oh, I know! I'll just ask my teacher for help. She'll know what to do.

Teacher! Teacher! Help me out here!

Okay, my teacher just told me that I need to follow the order of operations. That means I need to do the multiplication first, then the addition.

llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm trying to solve this math problem, and I'm not sure what to do. It says 4*3 + 2. I know what the multiplication symbol means, so I think I'm supposed to multiply 4 and 3. That gives me 12. But then there's this plus sign, and I'm not sure what to do with it. I know it means add, but I don't know what to add. There's only one number left, which is 2. So, I think I'll just add 12 and 2, and that gives me... 14! The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?

Wait, I think I know! We have to do the multiplication first, right? So 4 times 2 plus 5 is 4 times 7 which is 28.

Then we add 12, so that's 40.

Lastly, we subtract 2 times 3 which is 6.

The answer is 34."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. I think it has something to do with following a certain order when doing math problems, but I'm not sure what that order is.

I think I'll just try to do the problem the way that makes the most sense to me. So, I'll start by adding 5 and 3, which gives me 8. Then, I'll multiply 8 by 2, which gives me 16.

So, the answer is 16.

I hope that's correct! If not, maybe someone can help me understand what I did wrong and how to do it correctly using PEMDAS."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think... Ok, I know I have to follow some rules to solve this problem. I remember my teacher said something about doing things in a special order.

First, I see a 5, and that's easy. It's just 5. Then, I see a 2 and a 4. My teacher said to do things inside the parentheses first, so I'll do 2 times 4, which is 8.

Now, I have 5 and 8. My teacher also said to do addition before multiplication, so I'll add 5 and 8, which is 13.

The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Okay, so we have two parts to this problem: 7*2 and 8*5.

First, let's do 7*2. That's easy, it's just 7 times 2, which is 14.

Now, let's do 8*5. That's also easy, it's just 8 times 5, which is 40.

4*3 = 12

Now, I have 12 + 2 = 14.

llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Oh, wow! This question looks a bit tricky! Let me see...

First, I think we should follow the rule of doing things inside the parentheses first. So, we need to find out what 2 + 5 is. Hmm... 2 + 5 equals 7!

Next, we have 4 times 7, which is 28.

Then, we have 12.

After that, we have to find out what 2 times 3 is. That's 6.

Lastly, we subtract 6 from 28, and that gives us... 22!

The answer is 22!"

First, I think I'm supposed to do the multiplication part. So, 3 times 2 is... *thinks for a moment* 6!

Next, I think I'm supposed to do the addition part. So, 5 plus 6 is... *thinks for a moment* 11!

llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Okay! So, let's see... 

First, I know that when you have parentheses, you do what's inside them first. So, I'll start by adding 2 and 5. That gives me 7! 

Next, I multiply 4 by 7, and that gives me 28.

llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do some math problem, but I don't really know how. I mean, I know my numbers and stuff, but this thing with the symbols and stuff is a bit confusing. Like, what's the difference between + and *? And why do we have to do them in a certain order? It just seems like a bunch of random rules.

But whatever, I guess I'll try my best. So, the problem is 5 + 3*2, right? Okay, so first I'll do the multiplication, because that's what I was taught to do. So, 3*2 is 6. Now, I have to add 5 and 6, which is 11.
