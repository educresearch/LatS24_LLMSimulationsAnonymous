      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll give it my best shot!<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 and the multiplication sign. I know that means I have to multiply 4 and the stuff inside the parentheses. The stuff inside the parentheses is 2 + 5. I know I have to add 2 and 5 first, so that's 7. Then, I multiply 4 and 7 and get 28.<br><br>Next, I see the addition sign and the 12. I add 28 and 12 and get 40.<br><br>Lastly, I see the subtraction sign and the 2 times 3. I multiply 2 and 3 and get 6. Then, I subtract 6 from 40 and get 34.<br><br>The answer is 34!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm just a grade 6 student, and I'm not really sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But, I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is 4 times 2 plus 5. That's easy! It's 8 plus 5, which is 13.<br><br>Next, I see 12. That's a pretty easy number to work with.<br><br>Then, there's minus 2 times 3. That's -6.<br><br>So, if I add up all these numbers, I get 13 + 12 - 6, which is... (drumroll please)... 19!<br><br>The answer is 19.<br><br>How did I do? Did I get it right? Do I get extra credit? üòÅ</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this problem...<br><br>Okay, I know that when we have parentheses, we need to do what's inside them first. So, I'll start by adding 2 and 5 inside the parentheses. That gives me 7.<br><br>Next, I have 4 times 7, which is 28.<br><br>Then, I have 12 - 2 times 3, which is 12 - 6, which is 6.<br><br>So, if I add 28 and 6, I get 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, let's see...<br><br>First, I know that when you have numbers being multiplied together, you have to do that first. So, let's start by multiplying 4 and (2 + 5).<br><br>4 &times; (2 + 5) = 4 &times; 7 = 28<br><br>Next, I know that when you have addition and subtraction in an equation, you have to do addition first. So, let's add 12 to 28.<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>Finally, I know that when you have multiplication and division in an equation, you have to do multiplication first. So, let's multiply 2 by 3.<br><br>2 &times; 3 = 6<br><br>Now, we need to subtract 6 from 40.<br><br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let's see... I know I have to follow some rules to solve this problem, but I'm not sure what they are. I think I've heard of something called PEMDAS, but I don't really know what it means.<br><br>Okay, let me try my best. I'll start by multiplying 4 and 3, so that's 12. Then, I'll add 2 to 12, so that's 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.<br><br>I hope that's correct! If not, could someone please explain to me what PEMDAS means and how it works? I really want to learn!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm trying to solve this math problem, and I'm not sure how to do it. It says 4*3 + 2. I know what the multiplication sign means, so I think I should multiply 4 and 3 first. That gives me 12. Then, I'm supposed to add 2 to that? So, 12 + 2 = 14. The answer is 14. Is that right?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...<br><br>Okay, so we have 4*3, that's like, 4 groups of 3, right? That's 12.<br><br>And then we have 2, that's like, 2 more things.<br><br>So, if we have 12 apples, and we add 2 more apples, we have 14 apples!<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do some stuff with numbers, but I don't really know what that means. Um, let's see... 4 times 3 is 12, and then there's a plus sign, and then there's a 2. So... I think I'm supposed to add 12 and 2 together? Is that right? Uh, okay, so 12 + 2 = 14. The answer is 14! Is that correct?</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this...<br><br>Okay, I know that when we have addition and multiplication in a problem, we have to do the multiplication first. That's because multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations.<br><br>So, let's start by multiplying 2 and 4. That gives us 8.<br><br>Now, we have 5 + 8.

      <td>GPT Response: Hi there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure how to solve this problem. Let me think about it for a moment...<br><br>Okay, I know that the multiplication symbol (*) means we have to do the multiplication first. So, I'll start by multiplying 2 and 4, which gives me 8.<br><br>Next, I have to add 5 and 8, which gives me 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>Okay, so I see a 5 and a 2, and then some weird symbol that looks like a multiplication sign. I'm pretty sure that means we have to multiply the 2 and the 4. So, 2 times 4 is equal to 8.<br><br>Now, I see a plus sign, which means we have to add something. In this case, it's the 5 and the 8. So, 5 + 8 is equal to... ummm... 13!<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, but I don't know why. It just says to do it that way. So, I'll do the multiplication and then add the numbers.<br><br>2*4 = 8<br><br>Now, I add 5 and 8:<br><br>5 + 8 = 13<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication before the addition, but I don't know why. Can someone please explain it to me like I'm five?<br><br>Okay, so imagine you have five toy cars, and each toy car has three wheels. If you want to know how many wheels all the toy cars have in total, you need to multiply the number of toy cars by the number of wheels each toy car has. That's why we do the multiplication first!<br><br>So, in this problem, we have 3 * 2 = 6. Now, we add 5 to 6, and we get 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
