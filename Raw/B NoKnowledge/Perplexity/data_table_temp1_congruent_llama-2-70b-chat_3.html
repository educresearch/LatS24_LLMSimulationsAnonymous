      <td>GPT Response: Okay, I'll give it a try!<br><br>First, I see some parentheses, so I need to do what's inside them first. Inside the parentheses, I see 2 + 5. I know how to add, so I'll do that first. 2 + 5 = 7.<br><br>Next, I see 4 multiplied by something. I don't know what PEMDAS is, but I know that multiplication comes before addition and subtraction. So, I'll do 4 times 7, which is 28.<br><br>After that, I see 12. I don't know what to do with 12 yet, so I'll just leave it alone for now.<br><br>Finally, I see -2 times 3. I know how to multiply, so I'll do that last. -2 times 3 is -6.<br><br>Now, I need to add up all the numbers I have. 28 + 12 - 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Sure, I'll give it a try!<br><br>So, the first thing I see is the 4 inside the parentheses. I know that means I have to do whatever is inside the parentheses first. Inside the parentheses is 2 + 5, so I add those two numbers together and get 7.<br><br>Next, I see the multiplication sign, which means I have to multiply 4 by 7. That gives me 28.<br><br>After that, I see the addition sign, which means I have to add 12 to 28. That gives me 40.<br><br>Finally, I see the subtraction sign, which means I have to subtract 2 times 3 from 40. That gives me 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I can try to solve the problem.<br><br>First, I see a bunch of numbers and symbols. Let's start with the biggest number, which is 12. I'll just add that to the end of the problem for now.<br><br>Next, I see 4 and 2 + 5. I don't know what the '+' means, but I think it's like adding. So, I'll add 4 and 2 + 5 together. That's like, um... 4 + 2 + 5... hmm... 11!<br><br>Oh, there's a minus sign! That means subtract, right? So, I'll subtract 2 times 3 from 11. That's... um... 11 - 6... which is... 5!<br><br>And finally, I have 5 + 12. That's easy! It's... um... 17!<br><br>The answer is 17.<br><br>(Note: This solution is not correct, as it does not follow the order of operations. The correct answer is 14, which can be obtained by following PEMDAS: first, compute 2 + 5 = 7, then 4*7 = 28, then 28 + 12 = 40, and finally 40 - 2*3 = 14.)</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, let's see...<br><br>First, we have 2 + 5, and that equals 7.<br><br>Next, we have 4 times 7, and that equals 28.<br><br>After that, we have 12.<br><br>Last, we have 2 times 3, and that equals 6.<br><br>Now, we subtract 6 from 28, and that gives us 22.<br><br>The answer is 22.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...<br><br>Okay, I know that when we multiply numbers, we do it from left to right. So, 4*3 means we multiply 4 and 3 first.<br><br>4*3 = 12<br><br>Now, we add 2 to 12.<br><br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>The answer is 14.<br><br>I hope that's right!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?<br><br>Oh, you want me to try? Well, I guess I can try. Let me see... 4 times 3 is 12, and then plus 2 is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.<br><br>I hope that's correct!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I think I can help you with the question!<br><br>So, the first thing I would do is multiply 4 and 3, because that's what the multiplication symbol tells me to do. That gives me 12.<br><br>Then, I see a plus sign, and I know that means I have to add something. In this case, it's 2. So, I add 2 to 12, and that gives me 14.<br><br>So, the answer is 14!<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! Let's see... 4 times 3 is 12, and then we add 2, so that's 12 + 2, which is 14. The answer is 14!</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hi there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what PEMDAS means. Can you help me with that?<br><br>Okay, so the problem is 5 + 2*4. Let's see... 2*4 is 8, right? So, the problem is 5 + 8. That's 13!<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, I'm going to try my best to solve this problem!<br><br>First, I see a 5 and a 2. I know that 5 is bigger than 2, so I'm going to add 5 and 2 together. That gives me 7.<br><br>Next, I see some multiplication! I know that multiplication comes after addition, so I'm going to do the multiplication part next. I see a 4 and a 2, so I'm going to multiply 4 and 2 together. That gives me 8.<br><br>Now, I have 7 and 8. I'm not sure what to do next, but I think I need to add 7 and 8 together.

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication before the addition, but I don't know why. Can someone please explain it to me?<br><br>Okay, fine. So, 2 times 4 is 8. Now, I have to add 5 and 8. That's 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I've seen those letters before, PEMDAS, but I'm not really sure what they mean or how to use them. I think it's like a special way to do math problems or something.<br><br>Okay, so the problem is 5 + 3*2. I know what the plus sign means, it means to add stuff together. The 5 is easy, that's just 5. The 3*2 is a little trickier. I think the star means to multiply, so that's 3 times 2, which is 6.<br><br>So, if I'm supposed to follow this PEMDAS thing, I think I'm supposed to do the multiplication first. That means I do 3*2, which is 6. Then, I add 5 to 6, and that's 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.<br><br>Wait, did I do that right? I hope so!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, I'm thinking...<br><br>First, I know that 3*2 is 6, so I can write that down.<br><br>5 + 6 = 11<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think... Okay, I know that the multiplication sign looks like a letter "x"! So, I think we should do the multiplication first. That means we need to multiply 3 and 2, which gives us 6. Then, we add 5 and 6, which gives us 11. The answer is 11!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! So, I've got this problem here that says 5 + 3*2. Now, I know that the * means we have to multiply, so let's do that first. 3*2 is equal to 6. Okay, cool! Now, we have 5 + 6. Hmm... I know I've learned something about adding numbers, let me think... Ah yeah, I remember! We add 5 and 6, and that gives us 11! Woohoo! The answer is 11! ðŸ˜„</td>

But, I'll give it my best shot.<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is the 7 and the 2. That looks like a multiplication problem, so I'll do that first. 7*2 = 14.<br><br>Next, I see the 8 and the 5. That's another multiplication problem! 8*5 = 40.<br><br>Now, I'm not sure what to do. I don't see any parentheses or exponents or anything like that. I guess I'll just add 14 and 40 together. 14 + 40 = 54.<br><br>The answer is 54!<br><br>I hope that's right! Do you think I did it correctly?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do multiplication before addition, but I don't know why. Can someone explain it to me like I'm 10?<br><br>Okay, sure! Imagine you have a bunch of cookies, and you want to know how many you have in total. You have 7 rows of cookies, and each row has 2 cookies. That means you have 7 x 2 = 14 cookies in total, right?<br><br>Now, let's say you have another batch of cookies, and you want to add them to the total number of cookies you have. You have 8 rows of cookies, and each row has 5 cookies. That means you have 8 x 5 = 40 cookies in total.<br><br>So, if you want to find out how many cookies you have in total, you need to add the number of cookies in each batch together. In this case, you have 14 cookies from the first batch and 40 cookies from the second batch, so you have a total of 14 + 40 = 54 cookies!<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmmm, let me think... Okay, I know that when we have addition and multiplication in a problem, we do the multiplication first! So, I'll do the multiplication parts: 7*2 = 14 and 8*5 = 40. Then, I'll add them together: 14 + 40 = 54. The answer is 54!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hi! I'm a student in elementary school and I'm not sure how to solve this problem. Can you help me?<br><br>Okay, so I know that when we multiply numbers, we need to do it in a special order. First, we multiply the numbers that are close together, and then we add them up.<br><br>So, in this problem, I think we should multiply 7 and 2 first, because they are next to each other. That gives us 14.<br><br>Then, we need to multiply 8 and 5. That gives us 40.<br><br>Now, we add 14 and 40 together, and we get 54.<br><br>The answer is 54!</td>
