mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: I don't know about any special rules like PEMDAS, so I'll just do the operations from left to right and see what happens.

First, I'll do the multiplication: 4 \* 2 equals 8, and 2 \* 3 equals 6. So the problem becomes: 8 + (5+12) + 12 - 6.

Next, I'll do the additions inside the parentheses: 5 + 12 equals 17. So the problem becomes: 8 + 17 + 12 - 6.

Then, I'll do the remaining additions: 8 + 17 equals 25, so the problem becomes: 25 + 12 - 6.

Finally, I'll do the remaining subtraction: 25 - 12 equals 13, and 13 - 6 equals 7.

The answer is 7.","GPT Response: Hi! I'm a 6th grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS). But, I can still solve this math problem step by step.
First, I'll do the operations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.
Then, I'll multiply: 4 \* 7 = 28.
Now, I'll add and subtract from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40 and 40 - 2 \* 3 = 40 - 6 = 34.
The answer is 34.","GPT Response: I would start by doing the operations that are inside the parentheses first, because in my classroom we always do the operation inside the parentheses first. So I would add 2 + 5 to get 7.

Then the expression would look like this: 4 \* 7 + 12 - 2 \* 3

Next, I would do the multiplication and division from left to right. So I would first multiply 4 by 7 to get 28, and 2 by 3 to get 6.

Then the expression would look like this: 28 + 12 - 6

Finally, I would do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So I would add 28 + 12 to get 40, and then subtract 6 to get 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Well, I don't know much about order of operations, but I remember my teacher saying something about ""parentheses first."" So let's start with the part in the parentheses, which is 2 + 5. When we add those together, we get 7.

Now our equation looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, my teacher also mentioned that multiplication should come before addition and subtraction. So let's do the multiplication steps next. We have two multiplication operations: 4 * 7 and 2 * 3. 

First, let's do 4 * 7, which equals 28.
Then, let's do 2 * 3, which equals 6.

Now our equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

Finally, we just have addition and subtraction left. Let's do the addition first: 28 + 12 equals 40.

Then, we subtract 6 from 40, which gives us 34.

The answer is 34."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: I would first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then, I would add 2 to 12 to get 14. This is because I think it's important to do multiplication and division before addition and subtraction, but I don't know there's a specific rule called PEMDAS or order of operations yet.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a sixth-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will just solve this step by step according to how I was probably taught at this grade level.

First, I'll do the multiplication because that's what I see first:

4 * 3 = 12

Then, I'll do the addition:

12 + 2 = 14

So, the answer is:

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: I would follow the numbers and symbols in the order they are given and use the first operation I see. So I would first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12, then add 2 to get 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations, I would first guess that the answer is 14 because I might do the multiplication and addition at the same time. However, I remember my teacher mentioning something called ""order of operations"" but I'm not sure what it means. So, I will ask my teacher for help.

My teacher explained that there is a specific order to follow when solving math expressions: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), also known as PEMDAS.

In the expression 4 * 3 + 2, we should first do the multiplication:

4 * 3 = 12

Then, add the result to 2:

12 + 2 = 14

So, with the order of operations, the answer is 14.
