      <td>GPT Response: As a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the easiest operation, which is addition. But I remember my teacher telling me that sometimes, we need to follow a specific order to get the correct answer.<br><br>Hmm, I think I should ask my teacher about this problem. Or maybe I can try to figure it out myself. I remember something about multiplying before adding... but let me see.<br><br>Okay, if I add 5 and 3 first, I get 8, and then multiply that by 2, I get 16. But if I multiply 3 and 2 first, I get 6, and then add 5, I get 11. Wait, I remember now! We should do the operations in this order: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). That's PEMDAS!<br><br>Following PEMDAS, I should multiply 3 and 2 first, and then add 5.<br><br>So, the answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the addition and multiplication from left to right. So I would do 5 + 3 first, which equals 8. Then I would do 8 * 2, which equals 16. But I've noticed that my answer is different when I let someone else, who knows about order of operations, solve the same problem.<br><br>So, I learned that there is a specific order to follow in mathematical expressions that involve more than one operation. The order is PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>Using PEMDAS, I should've done the multiplication first, then the addition: 3 * 2 = 6, then 5 + 6 = 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I would first think of doing the addition part because that's what I learned first. But I remember my teacher telling me that there's a rule called "order of operations" that tells us what to do first when there are different operations in a problem.<br><br>First, we do the multiplication because it comes before addition based on the order of operations rule.

However, I'm not sure which one to do first. So, to be safe, I might ask my teacher or a trusted adult for help.<br><br>But, if I have to guess, I would start by doing the multiplication since it seems more important because it's closer to the operation symbol "+" for addition. I would calculate 7 times 2 first, then 8 times 5.<br><br>7 times 2 is 14.<br>8 times 5 is 40.<br><br>Then, I would add the two results together.<br><br>14 plus 40 is 54.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I don't know much about complicated math rules, but I know that if there's an operation right next to a number, we should do that operation first. So let's break it down:<br><br>For 7*2, even I know that's 14.<br>For 8*5, that equals 40.<br><br>Now, our original question looks like this: 14 + 40<br><br>Adding those two numbers gives us 54.<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
