      <td>GPT Response: Hi there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this question is asking me to do. I see a bunch of numbers and symbols, but I don't know what to do with them. Can you help me out?<br><br>Oh, you want me to follow some rules called PEMDAS? Okay, I think I can do that. Let me see...<br><br>First, I need to do the stuff inside the parentheses. There's a 2 and a 5 in there, so I need to add them together. That gives me 7.<br><br>Next, I need to multiply the 4 by the 7. That gives me 28.<br><br>Then, I need to add 12 to that. That gives me 40.<br><br>Finally, I need to subtract 2 times 3 from 40. That gives me 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.<br><br>I hope that's right! I'm not sure if I did everything correctly, but I tried my best. Can you please check my work for me?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>Okay, first I see a bunch of numbers and symbols, but I know I need to follow some rules to get the right answer. So, I'll start by multiplying 4 and 2, which gives me 8. Then, I see a plus sign, so I'll add 5 to 8, which makes 13. Next, I see another plus sign, so I'll add 12 to 13, which gives me 25. Finally, I see a minus sign and 2 times 3, which is 6. So, I'll subtract 6 from 25, which gives me 19.<br><br>The answer is 19.<br><br>I hope that's right! Can someone please tell me what this PEMDAS thing is and why it's important?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so we have this big problem with lots of numbers and symbols. Let's break it down step by step!<br><br>First, we have 4 times something. The something is 2 plus 5, so that's 7. So, 4 times 7 is 28.<br><br>Next, we have 12. That's easy! 12 is just 12.<br><br>Now, we have 2 times 3. That's 6.<br><br>Finally, we subtract 6 from 28, and that gives us... drumroll please... 22!<br><br>The answer is 22.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! Let's see...<br><br>First, we need to do the stuff inside the parentheses. That's 2+5, which is 7.<br><br>So, the problem becomes 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, we multiply 4 and 7, which gives us 28.<br><br>Then, we add 12, which makes it 40.<br><br>Lastly, we subtract 2 times 3, which is 6.<br><br>The answer is 34!</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! So, we've got this math problem that looks like this: 4 * 3 + 2. Now, I know we're supposed to follow some rules called PEMDAS, but I don't really know what that means. So, let's just do what makes sense, okay?<br><br>First, we've got this big number 4. That's a pretty big number, so we should do something with it. Let's multiply it by 3. That gives us 12. Whoa, that's even bigger!<br><br>Next, we've got this little number 2. It's not as big as 12, so we should do something with it. Let's add it to 12. That gives us 14.<br><br>So, the answer is 14. That's right, folks! The answer is 14.<br><br>But wait, there's more! My teacher says we're supposed to follow these rules called PEMDAS. So, let's see... PEMDAS stands for "Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction." Hmm, there aren't any parentheses or exponents in our problem, so we can skip those. But we did multiply 4 and 3, so that's good. And then we added 2 to 12, so that's good too.<br><br>So, the answer is still 14! Woohoo, I'm a math genius! Just kidding, but at least I tried my best, right?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll do my best to solve this problem.<br><br>So, the problem is 4 * 3 + 2. I know that when you multiply a number by 4, it's like adding that number four times. So, 4 * 3 is like 3 + 3 + 3 + 3, which is 12.<br><br>Now, we have 12 + 2, which is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.<br><br>I hope that's correct! Can you tell me if I did it right?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmmm... let me think about this one...<br><br>Okay, so we have four groups of three things, and then we add two more things. That sounds like a lot of stuff!<br><br>So, first, let's multiply the four groups of three things: 4 x 3 = 12.<br><br>Next, we add the two things: 12 + 2 = 14.<br><br>The answer is 14!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do multiplication before addition, but I don't know why. It just sounds like a rule my teacher made up. But okay, I'll follow the rule.<br><br>So, first I'll do the multiplication: 4 * 3 = 12.<br><br>Now, I have to add 2 to that: 12 + 2 = 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

Hmm... that's a bit tricky, but I think we can do it. Let's see, 7 times 2 is 14, and 7 times 3 is 21, so 7 times 4 must be... 28!<br><br>The answer is 28!</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so we have a big number, 5, and then a little number, 2. The little number goes first, so we do 2 * 4, and that gives us 8. Then, we add the big number, 5, to the little number, 8, and that gives us 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
