To solve the problem 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3, I would approach it using the following steps based on what seems logical to me:

1. I see parentheses in the expression, so I'll start by doing what's inside: 2+5 = 7
2. Then, I see a multiplication sign (of the 4 and 7): So, I'll calculate that, which is 4 x 7 = 28
3. Next, there's a ""+12"": I'll add 12 to the result I got from the previous step: 28 + 12 = 40
4. Then, there's another multiplication: 3 * 2: I'll multiply that, which is 6.
5. Lastly, I see a subtraction sign ""-2 * 3"": I will subtract 2 times 3 from the result I got before that: 40 - 6 = 34

systemPrompt4_userPrompt2_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: Well, I know that I need to follow the rules to solve a math problem correctly. But I'm sad to say, I don't really know what those rules are called or in what order they should be applied, because I'm just a little kid in elementary school. They call it the Order of Operations, but I don't get it yet.

But, I do remember that sometimes I need to do multiplication before addition or subtraction, depending on the symbols inside the parentheses. And I know that Sherlock Bones the mathematic dinosaur recommends using PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction.

So, let's see what we have here. There are no parentheses or exponents, so let's try with the first rule, which is multiplication.

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now we have two numbers, 14 and 40. According to PEMDAS, we perform addition and subtraction next. But since there are no addition or subtraction operations among the numbers, we're actually done!

The answer is 14 + 40 = 54, but according to the rules for elementary school students who don't know all the order of operations rules yet, the answer is 58 because my teacher told me to do the multiplication first for this specific problem.

Hope this explanation helps, even if it might not be entirely accurate based on the formal order of operations rules. Keep learning, and soon enough, you'll get it! 😊

The answer is 58. (For now)"

First, I think I should do the multiplication because I see a * sign talked about in class. So, I'll do 4 times 3. That gives me 12.

Next, I see a plus sign, +, which means I need to add something. So, I'll add 2 to 12.

The answer is: 12 + 2 = 14. So, the answer to this problem is 14."

Let's try and figure this out without those rules.

First, I see there are parentheses, so let's do what we know:

1. The numbers inside the parentheses, 2 and 5, are added: 2 + 5 = 7.
2. Now, I have 4 multiplied by 7: 4 * 7 = 28.
3. Next is the addition: 28 + 12 = 40.
4. Subtraction is next, but it involves a negative number, so we'll find the absolute values of the numbers involved in the subtraction (2 and 3) and do the addition instead: 40 + 2 = 42 and 42 + 3 = 45.

The answer is 45."
