      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But let's try to solve this math problem together!<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is a big 4. That's a bunch of apples, right? And then there's this weird symbol called a parentheses. I think it means we should do the stuff inside the parentheses first.<br><br>Inside the parentheses, there's a 2 and a 5. Let's add them together! 2 + 5 = 7.<br><br>Now, back to the big 4. We should multiply it by the 7 we just got. 4 x 7 = 28.<br><br>Oh, there's more! There's a 12 hiding over there. We should add it to the 28. 28 + 12 = 40.<br><br>But wait, there's a 3 and a 2 hanging out together. They want to be multiplied too! 3 x 2 = 6.<br><br>And finally, we subtract the 6 from the 40. 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34!<br><br>I hope that's right! Do you think I did a good job for a grade 6 student who doesn't know what PEMDAS means? ðŸ˜…</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is 4 and then some stuff in parentheses. I think I'm supposed to do what's inside the parentheses first, so let's see... 2 + 5 = 7. Cool!<br><br>Now, I multiply 4 by 7 and get 28.<br><br>Next, I see plus 12. That's easy, 28 + 12 = 40.<br><br>After that, I see minus 2 times 3. I'm not sure what that means, but I think I'm supposed to do 2 - 3, which is minus 1.<br><br>So, my final answer is 40 - 1, which is 39.<br><br>The answer is 39!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this problem...<br><br>Okay, I know I have to follow some rules to solve it, but I'm not sure what they are. I think I'll just do what makes sense to me.<br><br>First, I'll multiply 4 and 2 + 5, because that's what the problem says to do. That gives me 4*7 = 28.<br><br>Next, I'll add 12 to 28, because the problem says to do that too. That gives me 40.<br><br>Finally, I'll subtract 2 times 3 from 40, because that's what the problem says to do. That gives me 37.<br><br>The answer is 37.<br><br>I hope that's right! Do you think that's correct, teacher?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! Let's see...<br><br>First, I know that when you have multiplication, you have to do it before you do anything else. So, I'll start by multiplying 4 and 2 + 5. That's 4 * 7 = 28.<br><br>Next, I have to add 12 to 28. That's easy! 28 + 12 = 40.<br><br>Last, I have to subtract 2 times 3 from 40. That's 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>So, the answer is 34!</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm not sure what this question is asking, but I'll give it my best shot.<br><br>So, the first thing I see is the 4 and the 3. I know that when you multiply numbers, you have to do it in a certain order. My teacher told me it's like following a recipe. You have to do one thing at a time, or it won't turn out right.<br><br>So, I think I need to multiply the 4 and 3 first. That gives me 12.<br><br>Next, I see the + sign. My teacher said that when you see a + sign, it means you have to add something to what you already have. In this case, it's 2. So, I add 2 to 12, and that gives me 14.<br><br>The answer is 14!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do multiplication before addition, but I don't know why. Can someone explain it to me like I'm 10?<br><br>Okay, so imagine you have 4 groups of 3 things, like 4 groups of 3 apples. That's 12 apples in total, right? Now, if you add 2 more apples to each group, you'll have 14 apples in total.<br><br>So, 4*3 means 4 groups of 3 things, which is 12, and then adding 2 more things makes it 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I know that when we have addition and multiplication in a problem, we do the multiplication first. So, I'll do the multiplication and then add.<br><br>4*3 = 12<br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

Can someone help me out?<br><br>Oh, you want me to give it a try? Okay, I'll do my best. So, the problem is 5 + 2*4, right?<br><br>I know I need to multiply 2 and 4 first, so that's 8. Then, I need to add 5 and 8, and that's... hmm... 13!<br><br>The answer is 13.<br><br>Did I do that right?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think... Okay, I know that the * means multiplication, and we do multiplication before addition. So, I'll do the multiplication first. 2 times 4 is 8. Then, I'll add 5 and 8, which is 13. The answer is 13.</td>

So, we have to do 2*4 before we do anything else.<br><br>2*4 is equal to 8.<br><br>Now, we have 5 + 8.<br><br>My teacher also says that when we have numbers after the operation sign (like + or -), we have to do those last.
