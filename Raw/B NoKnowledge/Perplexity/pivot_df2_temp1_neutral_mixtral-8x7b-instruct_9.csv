mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Okay, so I don't know about this order of operations thing, but I'll just do the calculations in a way that makes sense to me. I'll add and subtract numbers in brackets first, then multiply and divide, and finally add or subtract any remaining numbers.

Let's break it down:

1. Inside the first parentheses, I'll add 2 and 5 to get 7.
2. So, the expression becomes: 4 \* 7 + 12 - 2 \* 3
3. Now, I'll follow the same rule: first multiply and divide. I'll start with the 4 and 7: 4 \* 7 = 28
4. So, the expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 2 \* 3
5. Next, I'll multiply: 2 \* 3 = 6
6. So, the expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 6
7. Lastly, I'll add and subtract from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40, 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Okay, so I don't know about this order of operations rule, but I'll just do the math from left to right.

First, I'll do the addition inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5, that equals 7.

Next, I'll multiply 4 by 7, which gives me 28.

Then, I'll add 12 to 28, which becomes 40.

After that, I'll multiply 2 by 3, which is 6.

Finally, I'll subtract 6 from 40, and that leaves me with 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: I would start by doing the operations inside the parentheses first, that's the ""P"" in PEMDAS. So I would add 2 + 5 to get 7.

Then I would move to the next step, which is multiplying and dividing. There are two of those operations, so I would do them from left to right. First, I would multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. Then, I would multiply 2 by 3 to get 6.

Next, I would add the result of the first multiplication (28) to the number 12. That gives me 40.

Finally, I would subtract the result of the second multiplication (6) from the result of the addition (40). That gives me 34.

So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: I don't know much about order of operations, but I remember my teacher saying something about a rule called PEMDAS. I think it means you should do Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Let's follow this rule:

1. Parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.
2. Multiplication: 4 \* 7 equals 28, and -2 \* 3 equals -6.
3. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right): 28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - -6 equals 46.

The answer is 46."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: I would first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then I would add 2 to 12 to get 14. So the answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a 6th grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will solve this problem step by step.

First, I will multiply 4 and 3 because that is what I see first. 4 times 3 equals 12.

Now my equation looks like this: 12 + 2

Next, I will do addition because that's the operation left in my equation. 12 plus 2 equals 14.

So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: Hmm, this looks like a fun math problem! I'm not sure about any order of operations, so I'll just solve it from left to right.

First, I'll multiply 4 and 3, which gives me 12. Now, I have 12 + 2. I know how to do addition, so I'll add 12 and 2 together to get 14.

So I would add 5 and 3 to get 8, then multiply that result by 2. Doing this, I get 16. However, I recently learned that there's a rule called PEMDAS which means we should do any operations inside parentheses first, then exponents, followed by multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally addition and subtraction (from left to right).
