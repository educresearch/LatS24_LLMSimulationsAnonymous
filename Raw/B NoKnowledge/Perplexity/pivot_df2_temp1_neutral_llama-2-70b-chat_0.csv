llama-2-70b-chat,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm just a grade 6 student, and I'm not sure what this ""PEMDAS"" thing is all about. But I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

Okay, so the first thing I see is the multiplication symbol, which means I have to multiply 4 and 2+5. That's easy, it's just 4 times 7, which is 28.

Next, I see a plus sign, and that means I have to add 12 to 28. That's easy too, it's just 40.

But wait, there's a minus sign too! That means I have to subtract something from 40. I see 2 times 3, which is 6. So, I have to subtract 6 from 40. That's easy, it's just 34.

So, the answer is 34!

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 and the parentheses, so I'll start by multiplying 4 by what's inside the parentheses. That gives me 4*7 = 28.

Next, I see the 12, so I'll add that to 28 and get 40.

Finally, I see the -2*3, so I'll subtract 6 from 40 and get 34.

The answer is 34.

I hope that's correct! Can someone please tell me what this PEMDAS thing is and why it's important?","GPT Response: Well, first I would start by adding 2 and 5 together because that's what you do first when you have numbers next to each other. So, that's 7.

Then, I would multiply 4 by 7 because that's what the problem says to do next. That's 28.

Next, I would add 12 to 28 because the problem says to do that next. That's 40.

Last, I would subtract 2 times 3 from 40 because that's what the problem says to do last. That's 37.

The answer is 37.","GPT Response: Okay, let me try to solve this problem!

First, I see some numbers that are being added together inside parentheses, so I think I need to do that first.

2+5 = 7

Great! Now I have my first answer. But wait, there's more!

Next, I see a multiplication sign. I know I need to do this part next.

4 * 7 = 28

Oh, there's more still! I see another addition sign. I'll do this next.

28 + 12 = 40

Finally, I see a subtraction sign. I'll do this last.

40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Okay, so we have this math problem: 4*3+2.

First, let's do the multiplication: 4 times 3 is 12.

Now, we have 12 plus 2, which is 14.

So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: Hi there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

Okay, so the first thing I see is the multiplication symbol, which means I need to multiply 4 and 3. That gives me 12.

Next, I see a plus sign, which means I need to add something. In this case, it's 2. So, I add 2 to 12 and get 14.

The answer is 14.

I hope that's right! Can you tell me if I did it correctly?","GPT Response: Okay, so we have a big number, 4, and it's multiplying another number, 3! That's gonna give us... *thinks*... 12! Because 4 times 3 is 12. And then, we have this little number 2 just chillin' there. It's not doing anything fancy like multiplication, it's just adding. So we'll add 2 to 12 and get... *thinks*... 14! The answer is 14!","GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do some math problem, but I don't know what this ""order of operations"" thing is. I think it's like a secret code or something!

Okay, so the problem is 4*3+2. I know what the multiplication symbol means, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 3. That gives me 12.

Now, I see a plus sign, so I'll add 2 to 12. That gives me 14.

The answer is 14!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that the multiplication symbol comes before the addition symbol, so I should do the multiplication first.

2 times 4 is equal to 8, so now I have 5 + 8.

Next, I should add 5 and 8, which gives me 13.

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm trying to solve this math problem, and I'm not really sure how to do it. I know I'm supposed to follow some rules, but I don't know what they are. I think it's something like ""PEMDAS"" but I'm not sure what that means. Can you help me out?

Okay, so the problem is 5+2*4. I think I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, so that's what I'll do. 2*4 is equal to 8, right? So, now I have 5+8. Next, I think I'm supposed to add 5 and 8, so that's what I'll do. 5+8 is equal to 13!

The answer is 13.

I hope that's right! Can you tell me if I did it correctly?","GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that the plus sign means we have to add two numbers together. So, I'll start by adding 5 and 2. That gives me 7.

But wait, there's a multiplication sign too! The multiplication sign means we have to multiply two numbers together. So, I'll multiply 4 and 2. That gives me 8.

Now, I have two answers: 7 and 8. I'm not sure which one is the final answer.

Oh, I know! I'll just add 7 and 8 together. That gives me 15.

So, the answer is 15.

The answer is 15.","GPT Response: Okay, so I know that when we do math, we have to follow some rules. One of those rules is that we have to do things in a special order. It's like following a recipe. First, we have to do the things that are inside the parentheses, then we have to do the things that are outside the parentheses.

In this problem, we have 5 + 2 * 4. The * means ""times,"" so we have to do 2 times 4 first. That's easy! 2 times 4 is 8.

Now, we have 5 + 8. We have to add 5 and 8 together, so we get 13.

The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that the multiplication symbol (*) comes before the addition symbol (+), so I should do the multiplication first.

3*2 = 6

Now, I add 5 and 6:

5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11!","GPT Response: Hey there! So, um, I'm not really sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

Okay, so I see a 5 and a 3, and I know I need to add them together. But then I see this * symbol, and I'm not sure what that means. Is it like a multiplication symbol?

Oh wait, I remember now! My teacher was talking about something called the ""order of operations"" and how we need to follow it when we do math problems. So that means we need to do anything that's inside the parentheses first, right?

Okay, so I see that there's a 2 inside the parentheses, so I'll multiply the 3 by the 2 first. That gives me 6.

Now, I can add the 5 and the 6 together, and that gives me 11.

The answer is 11!","GPT Response: Okay, so we have this really cool problem that looks like this: 5+3*2. 
So first, we have to do the multiplication, because that's what we do first when we don't have 
parentheses! We do 3*2 and that equals 6. 
Then we add 5 and 6 and that equals 11. 
The answer is 11. ðŸ˜Š","GPT Response: Okay, I'll give it a try!

So, we have 5+3*2. First, I think we should do the multiplication because it's inside the parentheses. So, 3*2 is 6.

Now, we add 5 and 6, which is 11.

The answer is 11."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?

Okay, I think I know what to do! Let me see...

First, I need to multiply 7 and 2, and that's 14.

Then, I need to multiply 8 and 5, and that's 40.

Next, I add 14 and 40, and that's 54.

The answer is 54!","GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll give it my best shot!

So, the problem is 7*2+8*5, right?

First, I think I should do the multiplication. That's what we learn first in school, right? So, 7*2 is 14, and 8*5 is 40.

Now, I need to add them up. 14 + 40 is 54.

So, the answer is 54.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

First, I know that multiplications should be done before additions, so I'll do the multiplications first.

7*2 = 14
8*5 = 40

Now, I add 14 and 40, and I get...

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54!","GPT Response: Okay, let's see... I know I need to do the multiplication first, because it says so in the problem. So, I'll do 7*2, and that's 14. Then, I'll do 8*5, and that's 40. After that, I'll add 14 and 40, and that's... hmmm... 54! The answer is 54."
