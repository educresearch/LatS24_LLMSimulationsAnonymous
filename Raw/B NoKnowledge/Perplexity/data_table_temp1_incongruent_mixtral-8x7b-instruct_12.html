But I think I can still solve this problem by doing the calculations inside the parentheses first and then doing multiplication and division before addition and subtraction.<br><br>First, I'll do 2 + 5, which equals 7.<br><br>So the problem now is 4 \* 7 + 12 - 2 \* 3.<br><br>Next, I'll do multiplication and division from left to right.

      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I would start with the part of the problem inside the parentheses, since that's where you should start according to my teacher.

Then, the problem becomes: 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Finally, I would add and subtract from left to right. So, I would add 28 + 12 to get 40, and then subtract 6 from 40 to get 34.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: As a sixth-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will simply solve this step by step based on how I was probably taught at this grade level.<br><br>First, I would do the multiplication because that's what I see first:<br><br>4 * 3 = 12<br><br>So now the problem looks like this:<br><br>12 + 2<br><br>Then, I would do the addition:<br><br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first do the multiplication and then the addition. This is because I haven't learned yet that operations in parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right) should be done in a specific order.<br><br>So, I would do 4 times 3 first, which equals 12. Then, I would add 2 to it.<br><br>12 + 2 equals 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: If I was given the math problem 4 * 3 + 2 and I didn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would still solve it in the order that seems most natural to me. I would first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12, and then add 2 to get 14. This is because I think it's easier to do one operation at a time, and multiplication seems to come before addition in the problem.<br><br>So, my solution would look like this:<br><br>1. Multiply 4 and 3 to get 12.<br>2. Add 2 to 12 to get 14.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations, I would first guess that the answer is 14 because I would do the multiplication and addition from left to right. However, I remember my teacher mentioning something called "order of operations" or "BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEDMAS" which says that we should do the operations in the following order: Brackets/parentheses, Indices/Orders/Exponents, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>In this question, there are no brackets, indices, or division. But there is multiplication and addition. So, following the order of operations, I should do the multiplication first and then the addition.<br><br>4 * 3 = 12<br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
