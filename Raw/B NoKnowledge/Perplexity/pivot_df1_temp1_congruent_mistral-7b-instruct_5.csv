mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure what to do with this equation because I've never heard of anything called PEMDAS or order of operations. But I see some numbers and some symbols, so I think I'll just follow the rules I know. I'll do addition before multiplication because that's what I've learned so far. So I'll do the multiplication part first: 2 multiplied by 4 is 8. Now I'll do the addition: 5 plus 8. The answer is 13. Therefore, The answer is 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: I'm not sure what the ""PEMDAS"" rule is, but I've heard that in math, we follow a specific order to solve an expression. Let's try to solve this step by step.

First, we need to find the results of the multiplications since they are executed before addition and subtraction.

1. Multiply 7 by 2: 7 * 2 = 14
2. Multiply 8 by 5: 8 * 5 = 40

Now, we add the results from step one to the result from step two: 14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I haven't learned about the order of operations yet. But I can still try to solve this problem by doing the multiplication first and then adding. So, I'll do 4 times 3 which equals 12, and then add 2 to it.

So, 12 + 2 equals 14.

The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not very familiar with the rules for solving mathematical expressions, but my teacher told me that we should follow some specific order when solving an expression. Apparently, it's called PEMDAS or Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). So, let's apply these rules step by step to the given expression:

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in this expression, so we move on to the next rule.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents either, so let's proceed to multiplication and division.
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right): We see two multiplication signs, so we will perform both multiplication operations. The first one is 4*(2 + 5). We'll do the expression inside the parentheses first: 2 + 5 = 7, so 4*7 = 28. Now we have the result of the multiplication, which is 28, and we'll use it to solve the next multiplication operation: 28 * 12 = 336.
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right): Now we have just one remaining operation: 336 + (-2*3). We know that when we do subtraction inside an addition or subtraction, we should convert it to a negative multiplication. So, -2*3 = -6. Adding these numbers, the answer is 336 + (-6) = 330.

So, the answer is: The answer is 330."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure about this ""PEMDAS"" rule you mentioned. But I think the numbers inside the parentheses should be done first, if there are any. And fingers help me remember: Multiplication and Division before Addition and Subtraction.

Let's see if we have any parentheses in our problem. No, let's check again. Nope. Okay, no parentheses then.

Since the multiplication symbol is present, I'll do that first - 3 multiplied by 2 equals 6.

Now, I have 5 and the number 6. I believe addition is next according to what I understood about the steps. So, I'll add 5 and 6.

The answer is __.
The answer is 11."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Well, I'm a 6th grader and I've never heard of PEMDAS or anything like that. But I do know that when doing math, sometimes you need to follow certain rules to get the right answer. For instance, when you have an addition sign and a multiplication sign in the same expression, you usually do the multiplication first. So in this case, I'd do 2 times 4 first, which gives me 8. And then I'd add 5 to that, so the final answer would be:

The answer is 8 + 5 = 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Well, I'm in grade 6 and I haven't learned about the order of operations yet. But let me try to do this sum without it:

I think I should do the multiplication first, because I've learned that you do that before addition. So, I'll do 7 times 2, which equals 14. Then, I'll do 8 times 5, which equals 40. Now, I'll add those two results together.

So, 14 (from 7*2) + 40 (from 8*5) equals 54.

The answer is 54."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: As a sixth grade student, I haven't learned about the order of operations yet. But I can still solve this problem by doing one operation at a time. Let's start with the multiplication:

4 * 3 = 12

Now I have:

12 + 2

Next, I'll do the addition:

12 + 2 = 14

So the answer is:

The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I don't know aboutorder of operations yet, so I'll just do the calculations in the order that I see them from left to right.

First, I'll do the operation inside the parentheses:

2 + 5 = 7

Now, I'll do the multiplication:

4 * 7 = 28

Lastly, I'll do the subtraction:

28 + 12 = 40

40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

So, I'm not sure if this is the correct answer, but according to my simple calculation, The answer is 34."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: I'm not sure what to do first here, I think I should follow the rules I've heard my teacher mention once but I'm not really sure what they mean. Let me see if I can remember... There was something about parentheses first, then exponents, then multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction, right? Although I'm not entirely sure what exponents are. But let's give it a try with this problem:

3*2 comes before 5 + because of the rule I mentioned, so we should doing the multiplication first. Multiplying 3 and 2 gives 6. So our problem now looks like this:

5 + 6

Now, I remember that addition should come last, so we add the 6 to the 5:

The answer is 11."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I might not be familiar with the order of operations (PEMDAS) in mathematics yet. In this case, I would follow a simple rule: I would perform multiplication before addition.

So, I would first do the multiplication: 2*4 = 8, and then add the numbers: 5 + 8.

The final answer is:

The answer is 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: I'm just a little elementary student, so I don't know much about the special rules for doing math in a certain order. But I can tell you what I see in this problem: I see some numbers being multiplied and some numbers being added. I think I should do the multiplication first because that's what I usually do when I see numbers with asterisks (*) between them. So I'll do 7 times 2 and 8 times 5 first:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now I have 14 and 40. Next I see numbers with a plus sign (+) between them, so I think I should add those together:

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is: The answer is 54."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I have not learned about the order of operations yet. So, I would do the multiplication first because that's what looks easier to me, and then I would do the addition.

First, I will do the operations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.
Next, I will do multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28.
After that, I will do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40.
Lastly, I will do the last multiplication: 40 - 2 * 3. I don't know the rule for this one, but I see that I should probably do the multiplication first because of the equals sign between the subtraction and the multiplication. So, 2 * 3 = 6. Then, 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm just a little kid in elementary school, so I don't know much about those fancy rules for math yet like order of operations or PEMDAS. But I've heard that you might want to do the multiplication before addition in this kind of problem. So let's give it a try!

First, we have the multiplication: 3 * 2 = 6.

Then, we add the numbers that were not part of the multiplication: 5 + 6.

So, that makes it: 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Well, I'm just a kid in elementary school and I don't know what ""order of operations"" means. But I guess I should do the mathematics problem step by step, right? So, let's start with the star (*) since my teacher always tells me to do it first when she sees that symbol. That means I should do the 2 times 4, which gives me 8. Then, I add the 5 to that number.

So, it goes like this:

First, 2 * 4 = 8,
Then, 5 + 8.

Now, I just need to add the two numbers together:

8 + 5 = 13

Now, I have 14 and I need to add 8 times 5. Let's see, I can do multiplication first, so:

8 * 5 = 40

And now I add 14 to 40:

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: I see numbers and symbols on this paper that I'm supposed to work with. The first things I notice are the numbers 4, 3, and 2. And there are two symbols, a star (*) and a plus sign (+). I think maybe I need to do something with the star first because it's usually done before the plus sign, but I'm not sure. Let me try this, and if it looks wrong, I'll ask for help.

I'll do the multiplication first:

4 * 3 = 12

Now, I have 12, and I'm supposed to add 2 to it. So, I'll do that next:

12 + 2 = 14
