systemPrompt4_userPrompt2_modelllama-2-70b-chat_temp1_maxtoken500,llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: Okay! So, I know that when we do math, we have to follow some rules. One of those rules is called the ""order of operations."" It helps us figure out which operations to do first.

The order of operations is like a recipe. We have to follow the steps in the recipe to make sure our math is correct. The steps are:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents (like squaring or cubing)
3. Multiplication and Division (we do these in the order they appear from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (we do these in the order they appear from left to right)

Now, let's look at the problem: 7 * 2 + 8 * 5.

First, we need to do the multiplication. We have two multiplication problems: 7 * 2 and 8 * 5. We do these in the order they appear from left to right.

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Next, we need to add 14 and 40. We add 14 + 40 = 54.

So, the final answer is 54.

The answer is 54."

First, I see a bunch of numbers and signs, so I'll just follow the rules I've learned in class.

I'll start by multiplying 4 and 2+5, which gives me 4 * 7 = 28.

Next, I see a minus sign, so I'll subtract 2 * 3 from 28, which gives me 28 - 6 = 22.

Finally, I see a plus sign and a number, so I'll add 12 to 22, which gives me 34.

The answer is 34."
