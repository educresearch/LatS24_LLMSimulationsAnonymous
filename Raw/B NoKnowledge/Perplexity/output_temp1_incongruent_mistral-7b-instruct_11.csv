1) 7 * 2 = 14
2) 8 * 5 = 40

Now, I have two numbers that I got from the multiplication: 14 and 40. I'm not sure what to do next. Maybe we can add them together? Let me try that:

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54."

The problem is 4 * 3 + 2. So first, let's do the multiplication: 4 * 3 = 12. Now, we have 12 and we need to add 2. So we do that: 12 + 2 = 14.

First, let's do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.

Now we have 4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, we do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28.

So now it's 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Let's do the subtraction inside the parentheses: 2 - 3 = -1.

Now it's 28 + 12 + (-1).

Lastly, do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40, 40 + (-1) = 39.

The answer is 39."
