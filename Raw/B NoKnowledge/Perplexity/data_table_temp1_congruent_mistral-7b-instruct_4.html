      <td>GPT Response: As a 6th grade student, I haven't learned about order of operations yet, but I'll do my best to solve this problem by guessing the order. Here's my attempt:<br><br>1. I see multiplication and addition, so I'll try doing the multiplication first.<br>2. Next, I see the parentheses (2 + 5), so I assume they come before the multiplication, because they look important. So, I'll do the addition inside the parentheses first.<br>3. Now, I have 4*(2 + 5). Since I think the parentheses come before multiplication, I'll do the addition inside the parentheses: 4*(7).<br>4. Finally, I have multiplication and addition left: 4*7 + 12 - 2*3. Now, I just need to do these in order from left to right, according to what seems most logical to me.<br><br>The answer is __.<br><br>Let me check: 4*7 = 28, 28 + 12 = 40, 40 - 2*3 = 38<br><br>The answer is 38.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: As a beginner elementary school student, I would follow the simple arithmetic rule I have learned: Perform calculations inside parentheses first, then multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction.<br><br>Following this rule, I would first solve the expression inside the parentheses:<br><br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Then, I would perform the multiplication:<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br><br>Next, I would do the division (but since there is no division in this problem, I would skip that step):<br><br>---<br><br>At the end, I would complete the remaining calculation:<br><br>28 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Then, I would add:<br><br>30<br><br>So, the final answer is:<br><br>The answer is 30.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't know about order of operations yet. I will do the calculation step by step, following the way I think is logical.<br><br>1. First, I will add 2 and 5: 2 + 5 = 7<br>2. Then, I will multiply 4 with the sum I got: 4 * 7 = 28<br>3. After that, I will do the subtraction: 12 - 2 = 10<br>4. Finally, I will multiply 2 and 3: 2 * 3 = 6<br>5. Lastly, I will add the result from the previous step to the result I got before: 28 + 6 = 34<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, this looks like a math problem to me, but I'm just a grade 6 student and I don't really know anything about the order of operations, which is that weird acronym PEMDAS everyone keeps telling me about. But I'll give it a shot!<br><br>Let's see, there are some numbers and some symbols. I'll start with the ones that look like multiplication because they have little x's in between them. So that's 4 times 3. That makes 12.<br><br>Next, it looks like there's addition, so I'll add the numbers that are being added together. So that's 12 and 2. That makes 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a 6th grade student, I have not learned about the order of operations yet. I usually do math calculations from left to right, bottom to top. So, I will do the multiplication first and then the addition.<br><br>4*3 = 12<br><br>Now, let me add 2 to the result.<br><br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>So, the answer is:<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I would not be familiar with the order of operations rule in mathematics yet. So, I would follow a simple set of rules that I have learned so far to solve the problem.<br><br>First, I would do any multiplication inside the parentheses because that's what I've learned to do whenever I see multiplication signs. So, the problem becomes:<br><br>12 (4*3) + 2<br><br>Now, I would do any addition or subtraction outside the parentheses, from left to right:<br><br>12 + (4*3) + 2<br><br>After doing the multiplication inside the parentheses:<br><br>12 + 12 + 2<br><br>Then, I would combine the numbers inside the first addition sign:<br><br>14 + 2<br><br>Finally, I would do the last addition:<br><br>The answer is 16.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I see numbers and symbols on this piece of paper, but I'm not sure what they mean yet. Let's try this out. First, I'll do the multiplication because I think we should do that before addition, but I'm not surewhy. So, I'll do 4 multiplied by 3, which gives me 12. Now I have 12, and there's an addition sign and 2. I'll do that next, so I'll add 12 to 2. Therefore, the answer is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I haven't learned about PEMDAS rule yet, so let's just solve this step by step, doing whatever looks logical to me. I'll do multiplication before addition because the multiplication symbol (*) is closer to the number I'm supposed to multiply with (2), indicating that it should be done first. So, I'll calculate 2 * 4 = 8. Now I'll add 5 to the result I got: 8 + 5 = 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I don't really know about this order of operations thing, but my teacher told me to do the multiplication before addition. So, I'll do that first.<br><br>Two times four equals eight. So the problem becomes:<br><br>Five plus eight.<br><br>Five plus eight equals thirteen.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I see some numbers and some symbols. Let's try to figure this out. I think I remember seeing something called "multiplication" and "addition" signs. It looks like we're supposed to do the multiplication first and then add the results to the number next to it. So, let's do 2 times 4 and then add 5.<br><br>First, 2 multiplied by 4 equals 8.<br><br>Now, let's add 5 to the number we got before, 8.<br><br>So, 8 (from the multiplication) plus 5 equals 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.<br><br>Therefore, 5 + 2*4 equals 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure about this, but I think we have to do the multiplication before the addition, right? Because, I've heard people talking about something called PEMDAS or BIDMAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from what I remember), and Addition and Subtraction. So, according to that, Ishould do the multiplication first. So, it would be 3 times 2, which equals 6. And then I add 5 to that, so the answer is, uh, 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I've heard adults talking about this rule called PEMDAS when doing math problems. According to them, we should follow a specific order for different types of operations. Let's see what that means for this problem: 5 + 3*2<br><br>First, there's this thing called multiplication. So, I need to do the 3 multiplied by 2 (which is the same as saying, "3 times 2"): 3*2 = 6.<br><br>Now that we have the result of the multiplication, I can move on to the addition part of the problem: 5 + 6.<br><br>To add these two numbers, I simply put the numbers together and then carry over any carriers: 5 + 6 = 11<br><br>So, the solution to the problem 5 + 3*2 is 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I have not learned about the order of operations yet. So, I would suggest doing the multiplication first, then the addition.<br><br>Here's how I would approach the problem:<br><br>Since there is a multiplication sign (*), I will do that first. So, I have:<br><br>3 * 2<br><br>Now, I'll do the multiplication:<br><br>3 * 2 = 6<br><br>Next, I have the addition sign (+), so I will do that with the number I recently got, 6, and the number I started with, 5.<br><br>5 + 6<br><br>Now, I'll do the addition:<br><br>5 + 6 = 11<br><br>So, the answer is:<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I see some numbers and some symbols on this paper. I think the plus sign means to add, and the asterisk means to multiply. But I'm not sure which operation to do first, since in my elementary school we haven't learned about order of operations yet. Let me try it both ways and see which one makes more sense, then I'll choose that one.<br><br>First, I'll do the multiplication: 3 multiplied by 2 equals 6.<br>Next, I'll do the addition: 5 plus 6 equals 11.<br><br>So, my answer is: The answer is 11.<br><br>Or I could have also done it the other way around:<br>First, I'll do the addition: 5 plus 2 equals 7.<br>Next, I'll do the multiplication: 7 multiplied by 3 equals 21.<br><br>But somehow, doing it the first way, with the multiplication before the addition, feels more natural. So I'll stick with that answer: The answer is 11.</td>
