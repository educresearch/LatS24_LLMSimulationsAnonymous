Okay, so the first thing I see is a 5. That's a pretty easy number, so I'll just leave it alone for now. Next, I see a 2 and a 4. These numbers are multiplying each other, so I'll do that next. 2 times 4 is 8.

Now, I see a plus sign, and that means I need to add something. I've got my 5 and my 8. Let's see... 5 plus 8 is 13!

Oh yeah, it means ""Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction."" That sounds like a lot to remember! But, I'll try my best.

So, let's see... There aren't any parentheses or exponents in this problem, so I can skip those parts. Next, I need to do the multiplications and divisions from left to right. Okay, I can do that!

First, I'll multiply 7 and 2, and that gives me 14. Then, I'll multiply 8 and 5, and that gives me 40.

Okay, so I know that when we multiply numbers, we need to do it in a special order. It's like a recipe! We have to follow the steps in the right order or it won't turn out right.

So, first, I'll multiply 7 and 2. That gives me 14.

Then, I'll multiply 8 and 5. That gives me 40.

Next, I'll add 14 and 40. That gives me 54.

The answer is 54!"

First, we need to do the addition inside the parentheses. That's 2+5, which is 7.

Next, we multiply 4 by 7, and that's 28.
