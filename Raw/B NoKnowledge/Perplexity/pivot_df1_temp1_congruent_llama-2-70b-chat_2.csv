Okay, I know that when you have addition and multiplication in a problem, you have to do the multiplication first. So, I'll start by multiplying 2 and 4, which gives me 8.

Then, I'll add 5 and 8, which gives me 13.

The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know I have to follow some rules, but I'm not sure what they are. I think I have to do the multiplication first? So, I'll start by multiplying 7 and 2, that's 14.

Next, I have to multiply 8 and 5, that's 40.

Now, I have to add 14 and 40, that's 54.

So, the answer is 54!

The answer is 54."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I know we're learning about this cool thing called order of operations in math class, and I'm still getting the hang of it. Can you help me out with this question?

Okay, so it says 4*3 + 2. I know I need to do the multiplication first, so that's 4 times 3, which is 12. Then, I add 2 to that, so it's 12 + 2, which is 14.

The answer is 14.

I hope that's right! I'm still pretty new to this stuff, but I'm trying my best to understand it. Can you give me a thumbs up or a high-five if I got it right? Thanks for listening!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm not really sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it my best shot.

Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 and the parentheses, so I think I need to do that first. Inside the parentheses, there's a 2 and a 5, so I'll add those together to get 7.

Next, I see the 12, so I'll add that to the 7 to get 19.

Then, there's the minus sign and the 2 times 3, so I'll do that next. 2 times 3 is 6, so I'll subtract that from 19 to get 13.

And that's my final answer! The answer is 13.

I hope that's right, even though I'm not really sure what PEMDAS means..."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that the number 5 is just sitting there by itself, so we can start by adding 3 and 2. That gives us 3 + 2 = 5.

But wait, there's a multiplication symbol! That means we have to multiply 3 and 2 together. So, 3 Ã— 2 = 6.

Now, we add 5 and 6 together, and that gives us 11.

So, the answer is 11.

The answer is 11."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Hi there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

Okay, so the first thing I see is the 5. That's easy, it's just 5. Then I see the 2 and the 4. I know that 2 times 4 is 8, so I'll write that down.

Now, I have 5 and 8. I'm not sure what to do next. I see the multiplication symbol (*) and I know that means I have to multiply the 2 and the 4. So, I'll do that.

2 times 4 is 8.

So, the final answer is... 5 + 8 = 13!

The answer is 13."

I know I need to follow some rules, but I don't know what they are. I think I need to do some stuff in a certain order, but I don't know what that order is.

Okay, so the problem is 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3. I think I need to start by adding 2 and 5 together. That's easy, it's 7! So, now I have 4*7. Hmm, I'm not sure what to do next. I think I need to multiply 4 and 7, but I'm not sure. Oh well, I'll give it a try. So, 4*7 is... ummm... 28!

Okay, so now I have 28+12. That's easy, it's 40! But wait, there's more! I have to subtract 2 times 3. That's 6. So, 40 - 6 is... ummm... 34!

The answer is 34.

I hope that's right! I'm not really sure if I did it correctly, but that's my best guess. Maybe someone can help me learn the right way to do it?"

llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that when we add numbers, we do it from left to right. So, first, I'll add 5 and 2, which gives me 7.

Now, I see that there's a multiplication sign, and I know that multiplication comes before addition. So, I'll multiply 2 and 4, which gives me 8.

llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this problem for a bit.

First, I see a lot of numbers and symbols, but I don't know what to do with them yet.

Oh, I know! I remember my teacher saying something about following a special order when we do math problems.

It's like a recipe for cookies. We have to follow the steps in the right order or they won't turn out right.

So, let's see... what's the first thing I need to do?

Oh yeah, I need to do the things inside the parentheses first. That's like the batter for the cookies.

Okay, so I need to add 2 and 5. That's easy! 2 + 5 = 7.

Next, I need to multiply 4 by 7. That's like putting the batter in the pan.

4 x 7 = 28.

Now, I need to add 12. That's like adding the chocolate chips to the cookies.

28 + 12 = 40.

Lastly, I need to subtract 2 times 3. That's like taking out the cookies from the oven.

40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34! Yay, I did it!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it my best shot.

So, the problem is 5 + 3*2, right?

First, I think we should do the multiplication. That's what the * means, right?

So, 3*2 = 6

Now, we add 5 to 6, and that gives us 11.

The answer is 11.

I hope that's right!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication before the addition, but I don't know why. Can someone explain it to me?

Okay, so if I have 5 apples and my friend gives me 2 more apples for every apple I have, how many apples do I have now? Well, I have 5 apples, and my friend gives me 2 more apples for each of those 5 apples, so that's 2 x 5 = 10 apples. Now, I have 5 + 10 = 15 apples!

The answer is 15."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Okay! Let's see...

First, I know that when we have multiplication, we do it first. So, I'll do the multiplication parts:

7*2 = 14
8*5 = 40

Now, I need to add them together:

14 + 40 = 54

I think I'm supposed to follow some kind of special order or something. Let's see... I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, so I'll do that.

3*2 = 6

Okay, now I have my answer from the multiplication. But I still have this addition sign here. I think I'm supposed to do the addition next.

5 + 6 = 11
