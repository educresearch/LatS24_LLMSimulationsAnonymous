llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?

Okay, I think I know how to do this problem now. First, I need to add 5 and 2, which is 7. Then, I need to multiply 7 by 4, which is 28.

The answer is 28."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think... Okay, I know that when we have lots of numbers and operations in a question, we need to follow a special order to make sure we do the right calculations first. I remember my teacher saying something about PEMDAS.

So, let's see... PEMDAS stands for ""Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction."" That means we need to do any calculations inside parentheses first, then look for any exponents (like squaring or cubing), then do any multiplication and division from left to right, and finally do any addition and subtraction from left to right.

Let's apply that to this question:

7 * 2 + 8 * 5

First, we need to do the multiplication: 7 * 2 = 14 and 8 * 5 = 40.

Next, we add 14 and 40, which gives us 54.

Therefore, the answer is 54.

The answer is 54."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it my best shot. So, we have 4 * 3, which is 12, right? And then we have 2, which is 2. So, if we add 2 to 12, we get... 14! The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll try my best to solve this math problem.

Okay, so I see a bunch of numbers and operations in this problem. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I see 4 * 2 + 5. I know that 2 + 5 is 7, so I'll write that down.

Next, I see 12 - 2 * 3. I know that 2 * 3 is 6, so I'll subtract 6 from 12.

Now, I have 4 * 7 + 6. I'm not sure what to do next. I know that 4 * 7 is 28, but I don't know how to add 6 to that.

I think I need to add 6 to 28, so I'll do that.

The answer is 34.

I hope that's right! Can someone please tell me if I did it correctly?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it my best shot. So, we have 5+3 * 2, right?

First, I'll add 5 and 3, that's easy. It's 8.

Next, I'll multiply 8 by 2. That's 16.

So, the answer is 16!

The answer is 16."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Hey, I'm just a grade 6 student, I don't know anything about this fancy ""order of operations"" stuff. But, I do know how to do basic math!

So, let's see... 5 + 2 is equal to 7, and then we multiply 7 by 4, which gives us 28.

The answer is 28."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Hi there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

First, I'll multiply 7 and 2, which gives me 14.

Now, I'll add 14 and 40, which gives me 54.

So, the answer is 54.

I hope that's correct! Can you tell me if I did it right?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not really sure about this order of operations thingy. But I'll give it a try!

So, the first thing I see is the multiplication sign, which means I have to multiply 4 and 3. That gives me 12.

Next, I see the addition sign, which means I have to add 2 to 12. That gives me 14.

So, the answer is 14!

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

Okay, so the problem is 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3. Let's start by multiplying 4 by 7 (because 2+5 is 7). That gives us 28.

Next, we add 12 to 28, which makes 40.

Finally, we subtract 2 times 3, which is 6.

So, the answer is 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I've got this math problem here, and I'm supposed to find the answer. It looks like this: 5+3 * 2. Now, I know I've got to follow some rules to get the right answer, but I don't really know what they are. I think I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, so I'll start by multiplying 3 and 2. That gives me 6. Next, I'll add 5 and 6, and that gives me 11. The answer is 11!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Well, I know that you always do addition before multiplication, so first I would add 5 and 2, which gives me 7. Then, I would multiply 4 by 7, which gives me 28. The answer is 28."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it my best shot.

So, we have 7 * 2, which is 14. Then we have 8 * 5, which is 40.

Now, I'm not sure what to do next. I know we have to add 14 and 40, but which one should we add first?

Oh wait, I remember something my teacher said about adding numbers in a certain order. Let me see...

We should add the smaller number first, which is 14. So, 14 + 40 = 54.

The answer is 54!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm not sure what this ""order of operations"" thing is, but I'll give it a try.

So, we have 4 * 3, that's 12, right? And then we have +2, that's 14.

The answer is 14.

I hope that's correct! Can you tell me if I got it right?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm just a simple elementary school student, and I'm not sure what this ""order of operations"" thing is all about. But I'll do my best to solve this problem.

Okay, so I see a bunch of numbers and symbols here. Let's start with the multiplication. I know that 4 times 2 is 8, and 4 times 5 is 20. So, 4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28.

Next, I see a plus sign. That means I need to add something. There's a 12 hiding over there, so I'll add that to my 28. That gives me 40.

Oh, wait! There's a minus sign too! I need to subtract something. I see a 3 over there, so I'll subtract 3 from my 40. That gives me 37.

The answer is 37.

I hope that's right! Do I get a sticker or something? ðŸ˜„"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Okay, so we have this problem: 5+3 * 2.

First, we need to do the multiplication, right? That's what I learned in school. So, 3 * 2 is 6.

Now, we need to add 5 and 6. That's easy! 5 + 6 is 11.

So, the answer is 11.

The answer is 11."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do the operations in a special order, but I'm not really sure what that order is. I think it's like, do the multiplication first, then the addition? Or is it the other way around? Hmm, let me see...

Okay, so I have 5 + 2 * 4. I think I'll do the multiplication first, since that's what I think I'm supposed to do. So, 2 * 4 is... um... carrots? Wait, no, that's not right. It's 8! Yeah, that's right, 2 times 4 is 8.

Okay, so now I have 5 + 8. Hmm, that's a pretty easy one. 5 + 8 is... um... 13! Yeah, that's right, 5 plus 8 is 13.

So, the answer is 13.

The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Okay, let's see...

First, we have 7 * 2, which is 14.

Then, we have 8 * 5, which is 40.

So, if we add 14 and 40 together, we get 54.

The answer is 54."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Okay, let's see... 4 times 3 is 12, and then we have +2, so that's 12 + 2, which is... (thinking) 14! The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what the order of operations is. I think I need to follow some steps to figure it out.

First, I see some parentheses, so I need to do what's inside them first. Inside the parentheses is 2+5, which equals 7.

Next, I see a multiplication sign, so I need to do that next. 4 times 7 is 28.

Then, I see another multiplication sign and a subtraction sign. I'm not sure which one to do first, but I think I should do the multiplication first. 2 times 3 is 6.

Now, I see a subtraction sign. I need to subtract 6 from 28. 28 - 6 is 22.

Finally, I see a plus sign and a number, 12. I add 12 to 22, which gives me 34.

The answer is 34."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Ok, I'm thinking...

So, we have 5 and 3, and we need to add them together. That's easy, it's like counting apples in my lunch bag! 5 + 3 = 8.

But wait, there's more! It says ""*"" which means we have to do something called multiplication. I think that's like when my mom makes cookies and she has to multiply the ingredients to make enough for everyone.

So, 3 * 2 is like 3 groups of 2 cookies, that's 6 cookies!

Now, we add 8 and 6 and get... 14!

The answer is 14."
