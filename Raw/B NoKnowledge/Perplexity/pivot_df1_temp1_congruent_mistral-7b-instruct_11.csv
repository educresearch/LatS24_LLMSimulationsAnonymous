mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Well, I'm just a 6th grade student and I have no idea about this ""PEMDAS"" thing you mentioned. But, I remember my teacher saying that when we have an addition sign and a multiplication sign in the same expression, we should do the multiplication first, and then the addition. So, let's try that with our given problem:

First, we do the multiplication: 2*4 = 8

Now, we do the addition: 5 + 8

So, the answer is: The answer is 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure what this ""PEMDAS"" thing is, but my teacher once mentioned something about certain rules when doing math problems. I think it's something like this: you should do any operations inside parentheses first, then exponents, then multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right.

So, let's apply these rules to the problem at hand:

1. There are no parentheses, so we skip that step.
2. There are no exponents, so we move on to...
3. Multiplication: we have 7*2 and 8*5. According to what my teacher said, I should do the multiplication from left to right. So, I'll do 8*5 first: 8*5 = 40. Now I'll do 7*2: 7*2 = 14.
4. Addition: I have 14 (from the multiplication) and 40. Again, I should do addition from left to right. So, I'll add 14 to 40: 14 + 40 = 54.

The answer is: 54."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations (PEMDAS) in mathematics. But I can still try to solve the problem step by step, following what seems logical to me. I'll do the multiplication first, then the addition.

Here's how I would approach it:

1. Multiply 4 and 3: __________
2. The result of the multiplication is 12.
3. Add 2 to the result: ________
4. The sum of 12 and 2 is 14.

The answer is: The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: As a 6th grade student, I'm not familiar with the order of operations rule, PEMDAS. I'd approach this problem adding numbers inside the parentheses first, then multiplying, and finally adding or subtracting. So, I'd do:

1. Solve the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7
2. Multiply: 4 * 7 = 28
3. Add: 28 + 12 = 40
4. Subtract: 40 - 2 * 3 = 38
5. Since 2 * 3 = 6, the final answer is: The answer is 38 - 6 = 32.

Keep in mind, I'm just following what I believe is a logical sequence. If this is not the correct way, my teacher might want to help me understand the order of operations rule."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I've never learned about the order of operations in mathematics yet. So, I will simply do the calculation based on what I see from left to right.

First, I will do the multiplication: 3*2 = 6.

Next, I will do the addition: 5 + 6.

So, the answer is:

The answer is 11."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: As a 6th grade student, I haven't learned about the order of operations yet. So, I'll just do this problem by following the simple rule: ""Whatever operation sign is encountered first, do it first.""

Let's see what we have: 5 + 2*4

First, we have the addition sign (+), but we also have multiplication sign (*) later. Since multiplication is usually done before addition following the PEMDAS rule, however, I'm not aware of that right now. So, let's stick with my simple rule and do the addition first:

5 + _________

Now, we have to figure out what number should go in the blank for the addition. We have 5 on one side and 2*4 on the other. In my opinion, it seems fair to find out what 2*4 is first because the multiplication sign is there before the addition sign. But without the order of operations rule, I don't know for sure. So, let's calculate 2*4 to find out:

5 + _________
5 + 8

Now that we have the result of the multiplication (which should have been done first according to PEMDAS), we can do the addition:

5 + 8
__________
13

The answer is 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Well, I've got this math problem here: 7 * 2 + 8 * 5. I've never heard of this thing called PEMDAS before, so I don't know how to apply that to the problem. But since the problem has multiplication and addition, I'll try to do it step by step, as simple as I can.

First, let's do the multiplication:
7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now, I have 14 and 40. The ""+ "" sign is there, so I guess that means I add those two numbers together.

So, 14 + 40 = 54

The answer is: The answer is 54."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm a grade 6 student and we haven't learned about the order of operations yet. But I see there are multiplication and addition signs in the equation. I think maybe we should do the multiplication first, then the addition? Let's see:

First, I'll do the multiplication: 4 * 3 = 12

Now, I have 12 and need to add 2. So, let me do that:

12 + 2 = 14

So, the answer is: The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: As a sixth-grade student, I don't know about the order of operations yet, so I'll just do the arithmetic from left to right, following the natural sequence of operations. Let's start:

First, I'll solve the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

Now, I'll do the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28

Next, subtraction:
28 + 12 = 40

Lastly, I'll do the remaining multiplication:
40 - 2 * 3

Since the multiplication symbol ""*"" comes after the subtraction symbol ""-"" in the normal sequence of operations, I need to do the multiplication first. So,

2 * 3 = 6

Now, I can finally subtract:
40 - 6 = 34

The answer is __.
The answer is 34."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm just a grade 6 student, and I've never heard of the order of operations before. But, my teacher told us that sometimes we need to follow a specific rule for solving mathematical expressions. Let's try to figure this out together, step by step:

1. I'll start with the multiplication first, because according to what my teacher said, we should do that before addition.
2. The multiplication is 3 times 2, that equals 6.
3. Now, let's do the addition: 5 plus what we got from the multiplication, which is 6.
4. Five added to six makes eleven.

So, the answer is:

The answer is __11__."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about order of operations, I would likely try to do the addition first because that's what I see at the beginning of the equation. But then, I might notice the multiplication sign (x) in between and think, ""Hmm, what do I do with that?"" I might ask a teacher or a friend for help. They would explain that multiplication should be done before addition, according to the rules of order of operations (which I don't know by heart yet). So, the correct way to do this problem is:

1. Do the multiplication: 2 * 4 = 8
2. Replace the multiplication with the result (8) above the addition sign.
3. Do the addition: 5 + 8

The answer is: 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Well, I don't really understand this thing called order of operations yet. But my teacher said I should do the multiplication before addition. So, let's do the multiplication first:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now, I'll do the addition:

14 + 40 = 54

So, the answer is:

The answer is 54."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure what those strange symbols mean or the rules for solving them, but I'll try to give it a shot. Let's start with the multiplication since I've heard that's supposed to come before addition. So, I'll do 4 times 3, which is 12. Then I look at the addition part, which is 12 plus 2. That makes 14. So, the answer is...

The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I would follow the order of operations that I have learned, which is to do the operations inside the parentheses first, then any exponent, followed by multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right. So, for the given expression 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3:

1) First, I would do the operations inside the parentheses: 4* (2 + 5) = 4* (7)
2) Then, I would do the multiplication: 4*7 = 28
3) Next, I would do the subtraction: 28 + 12 - 2*3 = 28 + 12 - 6
4) Finally, I would do the addition: 34 - 6 = 28

The answer is 28."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: I'm not sure about the rules for doing math problems in this order. Let me try to do the problem by doing the multiplication first, then the addition. So, I'll do 3 * 2 which equals 6. Then I'll do the addition 5 + 6.

The answer is 11."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: I'm just a little elementary student and I've never heard about this ""order of operations"" business. But I can tell you this much: when it comes to adding and multiplying numbers, I've been taught to do the multiplication first, and then add. So let's give that a try!

First, we do the multiplication: 2 * 4 = 8
Then we add the numbers: 5 + 8 = 13

mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: I'm just a little student and we haven't learned about the order of operations in mathematics yet. But I can still try to do this sum by following the simple rule: I'll do the multiplication first, then the addition.

So let's do the multiplication:
7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now, I'll do the addition:
14 + 40 = 54

mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Hmm, this looks like a fun equation! I see some numbers and some symbols. I think we need to follow some rules to find the answer. Let's do this step by step.

First, I see the multiplication symbol (the star) between 4 and 3. I remember that we do multiplication before addition or subtraction. So, I'll do 4 times 3 first:

4 * 3 = 12

Now, I have 12 and the addition symbol (+) and the number 2. I remember that we do addition aftermultiplication. So, I'll add 2 to 12:

12 + 2 = 14

mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: As a fourth grader, I'd solve this math problem by following these steps: 

1. First, I'd do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.
2. Then, I'd perform the multiplication: 4 times 7 equals 28.
3. After that, I'd do another multiplication: 2 times 3 equals 6.
4. Finally, I'd subtract the smaller number, which is 2, from the larger number, which is 12. So, the difference is 10.
5. Lastly, I'd add the results from steps 2 and 4: 28 + 10 equals 38.

The answer is 38."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know about something called ""order of operations"" yet. But I'll try to be smart and figure it out! Let's do the multiplication first because I see a asterisk (*) which means ""multiplication"" right? So, that's 3 multiplied by 2 which gives me 6.
