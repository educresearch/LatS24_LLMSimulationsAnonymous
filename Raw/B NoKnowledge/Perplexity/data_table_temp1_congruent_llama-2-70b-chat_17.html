      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm glad you asked me for help with this math problem. It looks a bit tricky, but I'll do my best to solve it.<br><br>First, let's start by following the order of operations. We have parentheses, so we need to solve what's inside them first. It looks like we have 2 + 5 inside the parentheses. If we add those numbers together, we get 7.<br><br>Next, we have the multiplication sign. We have 4 multiplied by 7, which is 28.<br><br>Now, we move on to the addition and subtraction parts of the problem. We have 12 + 28, which is 40.<br><br>Finally, we have the last part of the problem, which is 2 times 3. That's 6.<br><br>Now, let's work out the final answer. We have 40 - 6, which is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a 6th grader and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is 4 times 2 plus 5. That's easy, it's 8 + 5 = 13.<br><br>Next, I see 12. That's a big number! I like big numbers.<br><br>Then, I see minus 2 times 3. That's easy too, it's 2 x 3 = 6.<br><br>Now, I have 13 + 12 - 6. Let's see... 13 + 12 is 25, and then minus 6 is 19.<br><br>The answer is 19!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I don't know what PEMDAS means, but I can try to solve the problem.<br><br>First, I would multiply 4 and 2 + 5.<br>4*2 = 8<br>4*5 = 20<br>8 + 20 = 28<br><br>Next, I would add 12.<br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>Lastly, I would subtract 2 times 3.<br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem, but I'll try my best!<br><br>First, I see a bunch of numbers and symbols, but I don't know what they mean. I know I need to follow some rules to find the answer.<br><br>I see a multiplication sign, so I know I need to multiply 4 and 2 + 5. I'm not sure what the answer is, but I think it's 20.<br><br>Next, I see a plus sign, so I add 12 to 20. That gives me 32.<br><br>Finally, I see a minus sign and 2 times 3. I'm not sure what that means, but I think it's 6. So, I subtract 6 from 32, and that gives me 26.<br><br>The answer is 26.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm not sure what this "PEMDAS" thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>Okay, so I see a bunch of numbers and symbols here. Let's start with the multiplication symbol, which looks like a cross. We have 4 and 3 inside the cross, so that means we need to multiply them together.<br><br>I know that 4 is bigger than 3, so I'll multiply 4 by 3 and get 12.<br><br>Now, there's a plus sign followed by the number 2. I'm not sure what that means, but I think it means we need to add 2 to the number we just got, which is 12.<br><br>So, 12 + 2 = 14.<br><br>The answer is 14!</td>

The problem is 5 + 2*4. I think I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, so I'll do 2*4. That's 8. Then, I'll add 5 and 8, which is 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! So, I know I'm in 6th grade and we're learning about this cool thing called order of operations. It's like a secret code that helps us figure out the right way to do math problems. I'm still getting the hang of it, but I think I've got it down pretty well.<br><br>Okay, so let's take a look at this problem: 5 + 3*2. The first thing I do is parentheses. I see that there are no parentheses in this problem, so that's good. Then, I look for exponents. I don't see any exponents either. Next, I check for multiplication and division. I see that there is a multiplication symbol (the *), so I do that next.<br><br>I multiply 3 and 2, and I get 6. Now, I add 5 and 6, and I get 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.<br><br>I hope that's right! I'm still pretty new at this, so if I did something wrong, please let me know. But I think I followed the order of operations correctly, and I got the right answer. Yay!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hi there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure how to solve this problem. Can you help me?<br><br>Okay, so I know that 3*2 is equal to 6.<br><br>Then, there's the number 5. I'm not sure what to do with it. Do I add it to 6?<br><br>Oh, wait! I think I know! We have to follow some sort of rule, right? Like, do the multiplication first and then add the other number.<br><br>So, I'll do 3*2 first, and that's 6. Then, I'll add 5 to 6 and that's... 11!<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, let me think... 5 + 3*2... Hmm... 3*2 is 6, right? So, 5 + 6 is 11! The answer is 11. üòÅ</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know nothing about order of operations, but I do know that multiplication comes before addition! <br><br>So, first, I'll multiply 3 and 2, that's 6. <br><br>Then, I'll add 5 and 6, that's 11. <br><br>The answer is 11!</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! So, I know we've been learning about this thing called order of operations in math class, but I'm not really sure how it works. I think it's like a secret code or something! But, I'll give it my best shot.<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see in this problem is the multiplication symbol, which looks like a big X. I know that means we have to multiply the numbers together. The first number is 7, and the second number is 2, so I'll multiply them together and get... (drumroll please) 14!<br><br>But wait, there's more! The problem also has a plus sign (+) and another multiplication symbol. Oh man, this is getting complicated! The second multiplication symbol means we have to multiply again, this time with the numbers 8 and 5. Let me see... 8 times 5 is... (thinking really hard) 40!<br><br>Now, I'm not sure what to do next. I know I have to add something, but I'm not sure what. I think I need to add 14 and 40 together. Is that right? (finger crossed) Yeah, that's right! So, if I add 14 and 40 together, I get... (drumroll again) 54!<br><br>The answer is 54. Woohoo! I did it! (super happy face)</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, let me think...<br><br>So, we have two numbers being multiplied together, 7 and 2, and then we have another two numbers being multiplied together, 8 and 5.<br><br>I know that when we multiply numbers together, we have to do it in a special order, like this:<br><br>First, we multiply the two numbers that are closest to each other, which are 7 and 2. That gives us 14.<br><br>Then, we multiply the other two numbers, 8 and 5. That gives us 40.<br><br>Finally, we add the two numbers we got from multiplying, 14 and 40, together. That gives us 54.<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this problem. Okay, I know that when we have addition and multiplication in a problem, we do the multiplication first.

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so we have two parts to this problem: 7*2 and 8*5.<br><br>First, let's do 7*2. That's easy, it's just 7 times 2, which is 14.<br><br>Now, let's do 8*5. That's also easy, it's just 8 times 5, which is 40.<br><br>Now, we need to add 14 and 40 together. That's a little harder, but we can do it! 14 + 40 is equal to 54.<br><br>So, the answer is 54.</td>
