      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm not really sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it my best shot.<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 and the parentheses, so I think I need to do that first. Inside the parentheses, there's a 2 and a 5, so I'll add those together to get 7.<br><br>Next, I see the 12, so I'll add that to the 7 to get 19.<br><br>Then, there's the minus sign and the 2 times 3, so I'll do that next. 2 times 3 is 6, so I'll subtract that from 19 to get 13.<br><br>And that's my final answer! The answer is 13.<br><br>I hope that's right, even though I'm not really sure what PEMDAS means...</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm trying to solve this math problem, and I'm not really sure how to do it. I know I need to follow some rules, but I don't know what they are. I think I need to do some stuff in a certain order, but I don't know what that order is.<br><br>Okay, so the problem is 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3. I think I need to start by adding 2 and 5 together. That's easy, it's 7! So, now I have 4*7. Hmm, I'm not sure what to do next. I think I need to multiply 4 and 7, but I'm not sure. Oh well, I'll give it a try. So, 4*7 is... ummm... 28!<br><br>Okay, so now I have 28+12. That's easy, it's 40! But wait, there's more! I have to subtract 2 times 3. That's 6. So, 40 - 6 is... ummm... 34!<br><br>The answer is 34.<br><br>I hope that's right! I'm not really sure if I did it correctly, but that's my best guess. Maybe someone can help me learn the right way to do it?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this problem for a bit.<br><br>First, I see a lot of numbers and symbols, but I don't know what to do with them yet.<br><br>Oh, I know! I remember my teacher saying something about following a special order when we do math problems.<br><br>It's like a recipe for cookies. We have to follow the steps in the right order or they won't turn out right.<br><br>So, let's see... what's the first thing I need to do?<br><br>Oh yeah, I need to do the things inside the parentheses first. That's like the batter for the cookies.<br><br>Okay, so I need to add 2 and 5. That's easy! 2 + 5 = 7.<br><br>Next, I need to multiply 4 by 7. That's like putting the batter in the pan.<br><br>4 x 7 = 28.<br><br>Now, I need to add 12. That's like adding the chocolate chips to the cookies.<br><br>28 + 12 = 40.<br><br>Lastly, I need to subtract 2 times 3. That's like taking out the cookies from the oven.<br><br>40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34! Yay, I did it!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to follow some rules when doing math, but I'm not really sure what they are. I think I'm supposed to do the things inside the parentheses first, so I'll start by adding 2 and 5. That gives me 7.<br><br>Next, I need to multiply 4 by 7, which gives me 28.<br><br>Then, I need to add 12 to that, which gives me 40.<br><br>Finally, I need to subtract 2 times 3, which is 6.<br><br>So, the answer is 40 - 6, which is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! So, I know we're learning about this cool thing called order of operations in math class, and I'm still getting the hang of it. Can you help me out with this question?<br><br>Okay, so it says 4*3 + 2. I know I need to do the multiplication first, so that's 4 times 3, which is 12. Then, I add 2 to that, so it's 12 + 2, which is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.<br><br>I hope that's right! I'm still pretty new to this stuff, but I'm trying my best to understand it. Can you give me a thumbs up or a high-five if I got it right? Thanks for listening!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do multiplication before addition, but I don't know why. Can someone just tell me what to do?<br><br>Okay, so I have 4*3, that's 12, right? And then I have 2, so I just add 2 to 12 and get 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what this "PEMDAS" thing is, but I do know that when we have multiplication and addition in a problem, we do the multiplication first! So, let's do 4*3, that's 12. Then we add 2, so the answer is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do multiplication before addition, but I don't know why. It's just a rule my teacher told me.<br><br>So, let's see... 4 times 3 is 12. Then, plus 2 is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

So, I'll multiply 2 and 4, which gives me 8.<br><br>Now, I have 7 and 8, and I need to add them together. So, 7 + 8 is 15.<br><br>The answer is 15.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication before the addition, but I don't know why. Can someone explain it to me?<br><br>Okay, so if I have 5 apples and my friend gives me 2 more apples for every apple I have, how many apples do I have now? Well, I have 5 apples, and my friend gives me 2 more apples for each of those 5 apples, so that's 2 x 5 = 10 apples. Now, I have 5 + 10 = 15 apples!<br><br>The answer is 15.</td>
