mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: As a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think about doing the operation that's the easiest and most natural to do. In this case, I see addition and multiplication, and I know multiplication is taught before addition, so I will do the multiplication first:

2 * 4 = 8

Now, I'm left with the expression:

5 + 8

Finally, I'll do the addition:

5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: As a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the multiplication and addition from left to right. 

So, I would first multiply 7 and 2, which gives me 14. Then, I would multiply 8 and 5, which gives me 40. After that, I would add these two results together.

Therefore, the answer is 14 + 40, which is 54.

The answer is 54."

So I would first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12, and then add 2 to it.

12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: I would first add the numbers inside the parentheses, since I remember my teacher saying that we should do calculations inside parentheses first. So I would add 2 + 5 to get 7.

Then the equation would look like this: 4 \* 7 + 12 - 2 \* 3

Next, I would do the multiplication, since that comes before addition and subtraction in the order of operations. So I would multiply 4 \* 7 to get 28 and multiply 2 \* 3 to get 6.

Then the equation would look like this: 28 + 12 - 6

Finally, I would do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So I would add 28 + 12 to get 40 and then subtract 6 from 40 to get 34.

The answer is 34."

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about order of operations (PEMDAS), I will try to solve this problem: 5 + 2*4.

I will first do the addition because that's what I see first. So, I will add 5 and 2 to get 7.

Then, I will multiply the result by 4. So, 7*4 equals 28.

The answer is 28."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Well, I don't know about any special rules for doing math, so I'll just do this problem from left to right. It's like when I read words, I start from the left and move to the right. 

First, I'll do 7 times 2, which equals 14. 

Then, I'll add 8 times 5 to the result. Before I add, I need to do 8 times 5, which equals 40.

Finally, I'll add 40 to 14, and get 54.

The answer is 54."

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: I don't know about any order of operations, so I would just do the math from left to right. First, I would add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then, I would multiply 7 by 4 to get 28. But I heard that there is a rule called PEMDAS that says you should do multiplication before addition. If I follow that rule, I would first multiply 2 and 4 to get 8, and then add 5 to get 13. So, the answer is 13."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: I don't know about any order of operations, but I know that I can do the multiplication parts first. So I'll calculate 7 times 2 and 8 times 5.

7*2 = 14 and 8*5 = 40

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I would follow these steps:

1. First, I would do the operations inside the parentheses, which are addition and subtraction. So, 2 + 5 equals 7.
2. Next, I would multiply and divide from left to right. So, 4 times 7 equals 28, and 2 times 3 equals 6.
3. Then, I would add and subtract from left to right. So, 28 plus 12 equals 40, and 40 minus 6 equals 34.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: I don't know much about order of operations, but I know that my teacher said we should do multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. So for the problem 5 + 2*4, I would first multiply 2 and 4 to get 8. Then, I would add 5 to get 13.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Well, I don't know much about complicated math rules, but I remember my teacher saying something about doing calculations in a certain order. I think it's called ""order of operations."" According to this rule, we should first do any calculations inside parentheses, then exponents, then multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally addition and subtraction (from left to right).

For this problem, 7*2 + 8*5, I see there are no parentheses or exponents, so I should start with the multiplication parts. There are two multiplication operations: 7*2 and 8*5. I'll do those first.

7*2 = 14
8*5 = 40

Now I have two new numbers: 14 and 40. The problem says to add them together after the multiplication, so that's what I'll do next.

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54."

First, I'll do the addition inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5, that equals 7.

Then, I'll multiply 4 by 7, which gives me 28.

Next, I'll do the subtraction, which is 12 - 6, because I see that 2 times 3 equals 6. That gives me 16.

Finally, I'll add 28 to 16, which results in 44.

The answer is 44."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I would first think about doing addition before multiplication. But let me try it both ways to see what happens.

If I do the addition first, I get 8 + 3*2, which equals 11 * 2 = 22.

If I do the multiplication first, I get 5 + 6, which equals 11.

Hmm, those answers are different! Since I don't know about the order of operations, I'm not sure which one is right. I would ask my teacher to help me understand how to do this problem correctly.

The answer is 11 or 22, depending on the order of operations."
