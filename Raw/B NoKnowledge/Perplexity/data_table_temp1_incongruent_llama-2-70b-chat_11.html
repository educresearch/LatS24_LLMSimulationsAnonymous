      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>Okay, so I see a bunch of numbers and symbols here. Let's start with the easy stuff. I know that 2+5 is 7, so I'll write that down.<br><br>Next, I see 4 times 7, which is 28.<br><br>Then there's this weird symbol called a parentheses, and inside it, there's 12. I don't know what that means, but I'll just write it down.<br><br>After that, there's a minus sign and 2 times 3, which is 6.<br><br>So, let's see... 28 minus 6 is 22.<br><br>The answer is 22!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 multiplication symbol, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 2+5. That gives me 4 x 7 = 28.<br><br>Next, I see the addition symbol, so I'll add 12 to 28, which gives me 40.<br><br>Finally, I see the subtraction symbol, so I'll subtract 2 times 3 from 40, which gives me 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.<br><br>I hope that's right! Can you tell me if I did it correctly?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm not sure what this question is asking, but I'll give it my best shot.<br><br>First, I see a bunch of numbers and signs that don't make sense to me. But I remember my teacher saying something about following a certain order when we do math problems.<br><br>So, I think I'll start by adding 2 and 5 together. That gets me 7.<br><br>Next, I see a multiplication sign, so I'll multiply 4 by 7. That gives me 28.<br><br>After that, there's a plus sign, so I'll add 12 to 28. That gets me 40.<br><br>Finally, there's a minus sign and a multiplication sign. I'm not sure what to do here, but I think I'll multiply 2 by 3 and then subtract it from 40. That gives me 38.<br><br>The answer is 38! Did I do it right?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm just a elementary school student, and I'm not sure what this "order of operations" thing is all about. But I'll give it my best shot!<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 multiplied by something. That something is 2+5, right? So, I need to add 2 and 5 first. That's easy, it's 7!<br><br>Now, I multiply 4 by 7, and that's... um... 28!<br><br>But wait, there's more! There's a 12 in there too. I think I need to add that to 28. So, 28 + 12 is... hmm... 40!<br><br>Oh, and there's a -2 times 3 thingy too. That's easy, it's just 6.<br><br>So, 40 - 6 is... uh... 34!<br><br>The answer is 34!</td>

I think it's like a secret code or something.<br><br>So, let's see... 4 * 3 is 12, right? And then there's this plus sign, so I guess that means I have to add something. Oh, yeah! There's a 2 after the plus sign! So, 12 + 2 is... um... 14!<br><br>The answer is 14.<br><br>(I hope that's right! If not, I guess I need to work on my secret code-breaking skills. :P)</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so we have this really cool problem that looks like this: 4 * 3 + 2.<br><br>First, let's start with the multiplication part. We have 4 groups of 3 things, so if we multiply them together, we get 12.<br><br>Now, let's add 2 to 12, and we get 14!<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
