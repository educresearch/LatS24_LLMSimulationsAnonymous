mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I have not learned about the order of operations rule (PEMDAS) yet. So, I would try to do the multiplication first and then addition. Here's how I would approach this problem:

First, I would do the multiplication: 7*2 and 8*5

So, the calculations would look like this:
7*2 = 14
8*5 = 40

Now, I would do the addition of the results of the multiplication:
14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I don't know about order of operations (PEMDAS) yet. But I can try to do the problem by guessing which one to do first. Let's see, multiplication and addition have different symbols, so maybe I should do the multiplication first? 

So, I'll do 4 * 3 first: that's 12. Then I have 12 + 2. That's an easy addition problem: the answer is 14.

The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: I'm not sure about the special rules for doing math problems. I'd suggest we do the operations inside the parentheses first, then anything with exponents, followed by multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction.

Let's apply that to the problem:

1. Inside the parentheses, add 2 and 5 -> 7
2. Multiply 4 by the result from the previous step -> 28
3. Add 12 -> 30
4. Subtract 2*3 -> subtract 6 -> 24

The answer is _____.
The answer is 24."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I've never learned about the order of operations in mathematics yet. So, let me try to solve the problem without it. I will do the multiplication first because I see the multiplication symbol (*) before the addition sign (+). So, I will calculate 3 multiplied by 2:

3 * 2 = 6

Now, I have 5 and the result I got, which is 6. So, I'll add them together:

5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Well, I'm a 6th grade student and we haven't learned about the order of operations yet. But let me try to solve this problem with a logical approach:

I see there's an addition sign and a multiplication sign. Usually, we do multiplication before addition in our day-to-day life, so let me try that here:

First, I'll do the multiplication: 2*4 = 8

Now, I'll add the numbers: 5 + 8

So, here's what I got: 

8 + 5 = 13

The answer is 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Well, I've heard that when doing mathematics, there's an important rule to follow so that the solution is correct. It's called order of operations. But honestly, I have no idea what it's called or what it means! However, I've been told that when there are two or more operations in one expression, we must perform them in a certain order. I think it goes something like this:

1. Parentheses/Brackets
2. Exponents (powers)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Alright, based on that brief description, let's try to solve our problem, 7*2 + 8*5:

1. We don't have any parentheses or exponents in our problem, so we move on to the next steps.
2. We have multiplication, so we'll do that:
   - First, we do the multiplication on the left side: 7 * 2 = 14
   - Then, we do the multiplication on the right side: 8 * 5 = 40
3. Now, we have addition, so we'll do that:
   - We start with the first addition term: 14
   - Add the result of the other multiplication: 14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm a sixth grader and we haven't learned about order of operations yet. But let's try to solve this problem step by step. First, we do the multiplication: 4 times 3 equals 12. Then, we do the addition: 12 plus 2 equals 14. So, the answer is 14.

The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: As a 6th grade student, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations (PEMDAS) in Mathematics. However, let me try to solve the problem mentally with what I know so far:

1. First, I see that we have parentheses, so I will do what's inside it first: 2 + 5 equals 7.
2. Then, I see that I'm asked to multiply two numbers, so I will do that next: 4 multiplied by 7 equals 28.
3. Afterward, I see that another multiplication operation is present: 2 multiplied by 3 equals 6.
4. Surprisingly, there's also an addition problem and a subtraction problem left, so I assume these should be done last: I add 12 to 28, so the sum is 40. Then, I subtract 2 from 40, so the final answer is 38.

The answer is 38."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I have not learned about order of operations yet. So, I will try to solve the problem by doing the multiplication first, then the addition, which is not the correct way according to PEMDAS.

I see that there is multiplication (3*2), so I will do that first:

3*2 = 6

Now I have 5 and 6. I think I should add them together because there is a ""+"" sign, so:

5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.

(Note: As a side note, this is not the correct way to do it according to the order of operations (PEMDAS), but this is how I would tackle the problem given my current level of mathematical understanding.)"
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I'm not yet familiar with order of operations in math. I would suggest doing the multiplication first since the asterisk (*) represents multiplication, but I'm not completely sure about it. So, I'd calculate 2 multiplied by 4, which equals 8. Then, I'd add 5 to the result.

The answer is: 5 + 2*4 = 5 + 8 = 13. (But I'd realize that this is not the correct answer later, once I learn about order of operations)"
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Well, I'm just an elementary school student and I don't really know about the order of operations in mathematics yet. But, let me try to solve this problem based on what I think makes sense. I'll do the multiplication first since the numbers are smaller, and then add the results together. That's what I think I would do. Here's how it goes:

First, I'll do the multiplication:
7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Then, I'll add those two numbers together:
14 + 40 = 54

So, that's my answer. I hope it's correct!

The answer is: 14 + 8*5 = 54. (But I'm not absolutely sure that this is the right answer!)"
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: As a elementary school student who does not know about the order of operations, I would follow these steps to solve the problem 4*3 + 2:

1. First, I would do the multiplication because I see the numbers 4 and 3, which makes a pair for multiplication. So, I'd calculate 4*3 = 12.
2. Then, I would do the addition because I see the plus sign (+) that tells me to add the numbers. So, I'd add the result, 12, to the number 2.
3. Therefore, the answer is 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who knows nothing about order of operations, I would approach this problem from left to right and top to bottom on each line. So, I would first add 2 and 5, which gives 7. Then I would multiply 7 by 4, which gives 28. After that, I would subtract 2 from 12, which leaves me with 10. Finally, I would multiply 3 by 2, which gives 6. Then I would add the result, 28, to the previous result, 10, and subtract the final result, 6. The answer is 22.

The answer is 22."

But I think I can still do the problem. I'll just do the multiplication first, then the addition. So it would be like this:

3 * 2 = 6
Then, add 5:

5 + 6

mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Well, I'm just an elementary student and we haven't learned about the order of operations yet. But let's try to solve this problem in a way that makes sense to me. I think I should do the multiplication first because if I add 5 and then multiply 2 by 4, I might get a different answer than if I first multiply 2 and 4 and then add 5. So, lets do 2*4 which equals 8. Then I add 5 to 8, which gives me the final answer. The answer is __.

So, the final answer is: 5 + 2*4 = 13. (But since I don't actually know about the order of operations, I might have made a mistake. I'll have to ask my teacher to make sure!)"
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: I'm not sure what to do first, but I think we should do the multiplication before the addition because I've heard that's the rule in Mathematics.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Well, when I see this equation, I see an addition sign and two numbers, and then I see a multiplication sign and two numbers. I'm not sure what to do first, so I'll ask my teacher.

My teacher tells me that we need to follow a certain rule when doing math. It's called the order of operations, or PEMDAS for short. That stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this case, we have multiplication, so we should do that before the addition. So, let's calculate 3 multiplied by 2, which equals 6.

Now, we have addition, so we should do that. Let's add 5 and 6.

The answer is __.
