      <td>GPT Response: If I was given the mathematics problem "4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3" and I didn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would probably solve it from left to right. However, this can lead to incorrect results, as the order of operations is a rule that ensures consistent and proper calculation.<br><br>Using the order of operations, we first perform the operation inside the parentheses, then any exponents, followed by multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally addition and subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>So, for this problem, we would first solve (2+5) to get 7, then do the multiplication, then the addition, and finally the subtraction.<br><br>Here's the step-by-step solution:<br><br>1. Calculate the expression in the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7<br>2. Multiply: 4 * 7 = 28<br>3. Add: 28 + 12 = 40<br>4. Multiply: 2 * 3 = 6<br>5.

So, let's solve this step by step.<br><br>First, I see numbers with parentheses, so I'll do the operation inside them first: 2 + 5 equals 7.<br><br>Now the equation looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, there are more parentheses, but they only have one number each, so I'll do those multiplications: 4 times 7 is 28, and 2 times 3 is 6.<br><br>The equation now looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Now, I see addition and subtraction, and since there's no order for those, I'll do them from left to right: 28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 6 is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: If I were given the math problem 7 x 2 + 8 x 5 and I didn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would still solve it step by step. I would first multiply 7 and 2 to get 14, and then multiply 8 and 5 to get 40. Then, I would add the two results together to get 54. So, the answer is 54. But, since I now know about the order of operations, I would perform the multiplication before the addition. This would mean multiplying 7 x 2 and 8 x 5 first and then adding them together. This would also give me the same answer of 54, but it is important to follow the correct order of operations to ensure accurate results.<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I don't know much about this stuff, but I can give it a try! So, there are these rules called BIDMAS or PEMDAS which tell you what to calculate first, second and so on. They stand for Brackets/parentheses, Indices/Exponents, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>In our problem, there aren't any brackets or indices, so we look for multiplication and addition signs. Let's start from left to right:<br><br>1. Multiply 7 by 2, which gives us 14.<br>2. Then, move on to the next operation, which is multiplying 8 by 5, giving us 40.<br>3. Finally, add the two results together: 14 + 40.<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
