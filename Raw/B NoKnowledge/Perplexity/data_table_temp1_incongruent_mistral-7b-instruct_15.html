      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations in mathematics, also known as PEMDAS. However, I've heard that certain operations should be done in a certain sequence to get the correct answer. Let's try to solve this problem step by step:<br><br>1. When I see an addition sign (+) and a multiplication sign (*) in the same expression, I've been told that multiplication should be done before addition, but I'm not entirely sure why. So, let's do the multiplication first.<br><br>2. Multiply 4 by 3: 4 * 3 = 12<br><br>3. Now I have 12 and 2. I've heard that addition should be done last, but again, I'm not completely sure. So, let's do the addition:<br><br>4.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I see numbers and some symbols, but I'm not sure what they mean yet. Let's try to figure it out step by step:<br><br>First, I see the multiplication sign "*" between 4 and 3. I think it means to do a "four threes" kind of thing, so I'll do that:<br><br>4 * 3 = 12 (Four times three equals twelve)<br><br>Now I have 12 and the addition sign "+" and a 2. Adding two to twelve:<br><br>12 + 2 = 14 (Twelve plus two equals fourteen)<br><br>So, with what I know now, I'd say the answer is fourteen.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't know about the order of operations yet.

      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I haven't learned about the order of operations in mathematics yet. But, I think I can try to guess how to do it based on the symbols and numbers. So, I would first do the multiplication because there is a symbol (*) for multiplication, and then I would do the addition because there are two numbers (5 and 3) and a symbol (+) for addition.

      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I haven't learned about order of operations yet. But I can try to solve this problem by doing the multiplication first, then the addition.

But I don't know what order I should do them in. I think I should try the multiplication first because that's what I usually do when I see it, but I'm not sure that's the right thing to do. Maybe I should ask my teacher about it tomorrow.<br><br>So, let's try doing the multiplication first: 3 * 2 = 6<br><br>Now, I have 5 + 6. This looks easier.

      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS, but I can try to solve the problem using some logic. Let's break down the problem into smaller parts:<br><br>1. Solve the multiplication problems inside the parentheses (if there were any), but since there are none in this problem, we move on to step 2.<br>2. Do any exponents, but again, there are none in this problem, so we move on to step 3.<br>3. Multiply any numerals that are next to each other, such as 8 * 5. The result is 40.<br>4. Perform any addition or subtraction from left to right. Here, we have an addition (7 * 2 + 8 * 5). Let's first calculate 7 * 2, which equals 14. Now we have 14 + 8 * 5. Next, calculate 8 * 5, which equals 40. Finally, add these two results: 14 + 40. The answer is 54.<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
