I remember my teacher saying something about "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally" or something like that.<br><br>So, I'll start by multiplying 4 and 2+5, that's 4*7 = 28.<br><br>Next, I'll add 12 to 28, that's 40.<br><br>Now, I have to subtract 2 times 3, that's 2*3 = 6.<br><br>So, 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm trying to solve this math problem, and I'm not really sure what to do. I see all these numbers and symbols, but I don't know how to make sense of them.<br><br>Okay, so I know that when you multiply numbers, you have to do it in a certain order. I think it's called PEMDAS or something like that. So, I'll start by multiplying 4 and 2+5, which gives me 4*7 = 28.<br><br>Then, I see this symbol called a parentheses, and I know that means I have to do whatever is inside the parentheses first. So, I'll multiply 2*3 = 6.<br><br>Now, I'm not sure what to do next. I see a plus sign and a minus sign, but I don't know which one to do first. I think I'll try adding 12 and 6, which gives me 18.<br><br>Finally, I see a minus sign, and I know that means I have to subtract something. So, I'll subtract 18-6 = 12.<br><br>The answer is 12.<br><br>I hope that's right! I'm really not sure if I did it correctly, but I tried my best. Can someone please help me understand what I did wrong?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, first I would start by doing the multiplication. 4 times 2 is 8, and 4 times 5 is 20. So, that's 8 + 20 = 28.<br><br>Next, I would do the addition. 28 + 12 = 40.<br><br>Lastly, I would do the subtraction. 40 - 2 times 3 is 40 - 6, which is 34.<br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! Let's see...<br><br>First, we need to do the addition inside the parentheses. That's 2+5, which is 7.<br><br>So, now we have 4*7. That's 28.<br><br>Next, we have 12.<br><br>Finally, we have 2*3, which is 6.<br><br>So, we subtract 6 from 28, and that gives us...<br><br>The answer is 22!</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...<br><br>Okay, I know that when we do math, we have to follow some rules. Like, we have to do the things that are inside the parentheses first. In this case, we have 2*4 inside the parentheses.<br><br>So, let me see... 2 times 4 is equal to 8.<br><br>Now, we have 5 plus 8. That's easy! 5 plus 8 is equal to 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this problem...<br><br>Okay, I know that when we add numbers, we have to do it in a special order. We have to add the numbers that are close together first. Like, if we have 3 + 4, we have to add 3 and 4 together first, and then we get 7.<br><br>So, in this problem, 5 + 2*4, we have to add 5 and 2 together first. That's easy! 5 + 2 is 7.<br><br>Now, we have to multiply 7 by 4. That's a little harder, but I know that when we multiply, we have to do it in a special order too. We have to multiply the numbers that are close together first. Like, if we have 3 * 4, we have to multiply 3 and 4 together first, and then we get 12.<br><br>So, in this problem, 7 * 4, we have to multiply 7 and 4 together. That's easy! 7 * 4 is 28.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 28.<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>

I know what addition and multiplication are, so I'll just do them in the order they come in the problem. <br>So, first, I'll add 5 and 2. That's easy! 5 + 2 = 7. <br>Oh, but there's more! Now I see that there's a 4 next to the multiplication sign. <br>I know what that means! I have to multiply 2 by 4. That's also easy! 2 x 4 = 8. <br>Wait, what do I do now? I see that there's a plus sign next to the 5 and the 8. <br>I think I'm supposed to add them together. Okay, 5 + 8 = 13. <br>The answer is 13.!</td>
