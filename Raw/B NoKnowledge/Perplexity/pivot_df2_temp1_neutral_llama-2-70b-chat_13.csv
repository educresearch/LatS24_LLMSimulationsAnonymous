llama-2-70b-chat,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

So, we have some numbers and operations here. I know I need to follow some rules to get the right answer. I remember my teacher saying something about doing things in a special order.

Okay, first I see some parentheses. That means I need to do what's inside the parentheses first. There's a 2 and a 5 inside the parentheses, so I need to add those together. That gives me 7.

Next, I see a multiplication sign. My teacher said to do multiplication before addition and subtraction. So, I need to multiply the 4 by the 7 I got earlier. That gives me 28.

Now, I see a plus sign. My teacher said to do addition and subtraction from left to right. So, I need to add 12 to 28. That gives me 40.

Finally, I see a minus sign. My teacher said to do subtraction before addition. So, I need to subtract 2 times 3 from 40. That gives me 38.

The answer is 38.

I hope that's right! Can you check it for me, teacher?","GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it my best shot.

Okay, so the problem is 4*(2+5)+12-2*3. Let's see...

First, I'll multiply 4 by 2+5. That's 4*7, which is 28.

Next, I'll add 12 to 28. That's 40.

Finally, I'll subtract 2 times 3 from 40. That's 40 - 6, which is 34.

The answer is 34.

I hope that's right! Can someone please tell me what PEMDAS means?","GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this problem...

Okay, I know I have to follow some steps to solve this problem, but I'm not really sure what they are. I think I have to do the multiplication first, so I'll start by multiplying 4 by 2+5. That gives me 4*7, which is 28.

Next, I have to add 12 to that, so now I have 28+12, which is 40.

Lastly, I have to subtract 2 times 3, which is 6. So, my final answer is 40-6, which is 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem, but I can try my best!

First, I see a multiplication sign, so I know I need to multiply 4 and 2+5.
2+5 is 7, so I multiply 4 and 7, which is 28.

Next, I see a plus sign, so I add 12 to 28, which is 40.

Finally, I see a minus sign, so I subtract 2 times 3 from 40.
2 times 3 is 6, so I subtract 6 from 40, which is 34.

The answer is 34."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 3. That gives me 12.

Then, I have 2 left over, so I'll add that to 12.

The answer is 14.

Can you help me check if that's right?","GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. I think it might be some sort of secret code that my teacher uses. Can you please help me?

Okay, so I think I know what the problem is asking me to do. It's asking me to multiply 4 and 3, and then add 2. That sounds pretty easy!

So, if I multiply 4 and 3, I get 12. Then, if I add 2, I get 14.

The answer is 14.

Can you please tell me if I did that right? I'm still not sure what PEMDAS means, but I hope I got the answer right!","GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to follow some rules when doing math problems, but I don't really know what they are. I think I'm supposed to do things in a special order or something. Um, let's see... I think I'm supposed to do the multiplication first. So, 4 times 3 is... (pauses to think) ...12! Yeah, that's right. Okay, so now I have 12. Um, what's next? Oh yeah, there's a plus sign. That means I have to add something. There's a 2 there, so I'll add 2 to 12. (pauses to think) That's... (counts on fingers) ...14! Yeah, that's right. So, the answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Okay! So, we have this problem: 4*3+2.

First, let's do the multiplication: 4*3 = 12.

Now, we add 2 to 12: 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, so we have 5 plus 2 times 4.

First, I think we should do the multiplication. 2 times 4 is 8.

Now, we have 5 plus 8, which is 13.

So, the answer is 13.

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: Hey, I'm just a grade 6 student, I don't know anything about this fancy ""PEMDAS"" stuff. But let's see...

Okay, so we have 5 + 2 * 4. I know that 2 * 4 is 8, so...

5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.

I don't know if that's right, but that's my best guess!","GPT Response: Hey, I'm just a students in elementary school, and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll give it my best shot!

So, the problem is 5+2*4, right? I think we should start by adding 5 and 2, because that's what the problem says. So, 5 + 2 = 7.

Now, we have 7 * 4. I'm not sure what the * means, but I think it means we have to multiply 7 and 4 together. So, 7 * 4 = 28.

So, the answer is 28. I hope that's right!

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do addition and multiplication in a special order, but I don't really know what that order is. I think it's just like reading a sentence, so I'll do the multiplication first.

2*4 = 8

Now, I'll do the addition:

5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think... OK, I know I have to follow some rules to solve this problem. I think I should do the multiplication first because it's like a special kind of addition. So, 3 times 2 is 6. Now, I have 5 plus 6, which is 11. The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that parentheses are important in Math, so I'll start by multiplying 3 and 2 inside the parentheses. That gives me 6.

Next, I'll add 5 and 6, which gives me 11.

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that the plus sign means add, and the times sign means multiply. So, I think I should add 5 and 3 first, and then multiply 3 by 2. That gives me... (pauses to calculate) 8 + 6 = 14!

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Okay, so I know we're supposed to do addition and multiplication in a special order, but I'm not really sure what that order is. I think we're supposed to do multiplication first, so I'll start by multiplying 3 and 2. That gives me 6. Then, I'll add 5 and 6, which gives me 11. The answer is 11!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

First, I know that when we have multiplication and addition in a problem, we need to do the multiplication first. So, I'll start by multiplying 7 and 2, which gives me 14.

Next, I'll multiply 8 and 5, which gives me 40.

Now, I need to add 14 and 40, which gives me 54.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Hi there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

Okay, so I see a bunch of numbers and symbols here. Let me try to break it down.

First, I see a 7 and a 2. I know that 7 times 2 is 14, so I'll write that down.

Next, I see an 8 and a 5. I know that 8 times 5 is 40, so I'll write that down too.

Now, I see a plus sign (+) and a minus sign (-) in the problem. I'm not sure what to do with those, so I'll just ignore them for now.

Lastly, I see a parenthesis with a 2 inside it. I'm not sure what that means either, but I'll just leave it alone.

So, based on what I know, the answer to the problem is 14 + 40 = 54.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, so we have two numbers being multiplied, 7 and 2, and then we have a plus sign and another number being multiplied, 8 and 5.

I think we should do the multiplication first, so 7*2 is 14, and then 8*5 is 40.

Then, we add 14 and 40, which is 54.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do something with these numbers, but I'm not sure what. I think I'm supposed to multiply the first two numbers together, so that's what I'll do.

7 x 2 = 14

Now, I think I'm supposed to multiply the other two numbers together.

8 x 5 = 40

I'm not sure what to do next. I think I'm supposed to add the two numbers I just multiplied together, so that's what I'll do.

14 + 40 = 54

So, the answer is 54.

The answer is 54."
