mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: As a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think about doing the addition and multiplication from left to right.

5 + 2 × 4

I would add 5 and 2, which gives me 7, and then multiply that result by 4.

7 × 4 = 28

So, the answer is 28.

The answer is 28."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Okay, so if I was in 6th grade and didn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would just solve this math problem from left to right. It's like reading words in a sentence, you start from the left.

First, I'd do 7 times 2, which is 14. So now the problem looks like this: 14 + 8*5.

Next, I'd do 8 times 5, which is 40. Now the problem is: 14 + 40.

Finally, I add those two numbers together: 14 + 40 equals 54.

The answer is 54."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Well, if I were a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would just solve the problem from left to right. So I would first multiply 4 and 3, then add 2.

4 × 3 = 12

12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Okay, so I don't know about this order of operations thing, but I'll just do the math from left to right.

First, I'll do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.

So, the problem becomes: 4 \* 7 + 12 - 2 \* 3.

Next, I'll do the multiplication: 4 \* 7 equals 28 and 2 \* 3 equals 6.

So, the problem becomes: 28 + 12 - 6.

Now, I'll do the addition: 28 + 12 equals 40.

So, the problem becomes: 40 - 6.

Finally, I'll do the subtraction: 40 - 6 equals 34.

The answer is 34."

So I would add 5 and 3 to get 8, and then multiply that result by 2.

Doing this, I get 8 * 2 = 16.

The answer is 16."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Well, as a 6th grade student who doesn't know about order of operations yet, I would just do the math from left to right. So first, I would add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then I would multiply that result by 4. Doing the calculation, I get 28.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Well, I don't know about any special rules like PEMDAS, so I'll just do the operations in the order they appear.

First, I'll do 7 times 2, which equals 14. Then, I'll do 8 times 5, which equals 40.

Next, I'll add the results of those two operations together to get my final answer.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: As a sixth-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will simply solve this by doing the operations from left to right.

First, I'll multiply 4 and 3, which equals 12.
Then, I'll add the result to 2, so it's 12 plus 2.
Finally, I'll do the addition, which gives me 14.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Hi, I'm a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations in Mathematics yet. When I see a math problem like this: 4*(2+5)+12-2*3, I don't know that I'm supposed to follow the order of operations, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). Instead, I might just solve it from left to right, following the traditional rules of algebra.

First, I would multiply 4 by the result of the expression inside the parentheses, which is 2+5. I would add 2 and 5 to get 7. Then, I would multiply 4 by 7 to get 28.

Next, I would move on to the addition and subtraction parts of the problem. I would add 12 to the 28 that I just got, which gives me 40.

Finally, I would subtract 2 times 3 from that result. Multiplying 2 by 3 gives me 6, and subtracting that from 40 leaves me with 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+3*2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will solve this problem just following the usual way I was taught so far. I will do the operations from left to right.

First, I will add 5 and 3, which gives me 8.
Then, I will multiply the result by 2.
So, 8 times 2 equals 16.

The answer is 16."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Oh boy, this looks like a fun math problem! Even though I don't know about order of operations yet, I can still try to solve it.

First, I see the numbers 5, 2, and 4. I know how to add and multiply, so let's do that! I'll start by adding 5 and 2 to get 7.

Now my problem looks like this: 7 * 4

I remember my teacher saying that multiplication comes before addition, so I should do this part next. I multiply 7 and 4 to get 28.

The answer is 28. Isn't math cool? I can't wait to learn more about it!"
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: If I was given the math problem 7*2 + 8*5 without knowing about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first multiply and then add the numbers. This is because when I was taught how to do math, I learned to do multiplication and division before addition and subtraction, even if they come later in the problem.

So, I would do 7*2 = 14 and 8*5 = 40.
Then, I would add those two numbers together: 14 + 40 = 54.

Therefore, the answer is 54."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: I would first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then I would add 2 to 12 to get 14. So the answer is 14.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: If I was given the math problem 4*(2+5)+12-2*3 and I didn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would probably solve it from left to right. However, this can lead to incorrect results, as I would soon find out.

So, let's try it:

First, I would do the addition in the first parentheses, giving me: 4*(7)+12-2*3

Next, I would do the multiplication, giving me: 28+12-6

And finally, I would do the addition and subtraction from left to right, giving me: 40-6

So the answer is:

The answer is 34.

However, I have just learned that there is a specific order to solving math problems like this, called PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). So, I should have followed that order instead."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: I don't know about any order of operations rules, so I will just do the operations from left to right. First, I will add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then I will multiply 8 by 2 to get 16. The answer is 16.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Well, I don't know much about order of operations, but I remember my teacher saying something about doing multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. So let me do those first.

For the first part, I have 7 times 2, which equals 14.
For the second part, I have 8 times 5, which equals 40.

Now, I just add those two results together: 14 plus 40 equals 54.

The answer is 54."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Okay, so I'm a student in elementary school and I don't know about the order of operations in math yet. For this problem, let's just solve it from left to right.

First, I'll do 4 times 3, that equals 12. Then, I add 2 to that result. So, 12 plus 2 is 14.

The answer is 14."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: I don't know about order of operations, but I remember my teacher saying to always do addition and subtraction before multiplication and division, and multiplication and division before addition and subtraction again. This is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So let's follow that rule:

First, we do the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7

Then we multiply: 4 * 7 = 28

Next, we add and subtract from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40, and then 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
