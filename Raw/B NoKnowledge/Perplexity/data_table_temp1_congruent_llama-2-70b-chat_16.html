      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you explain it to me?<br><br>Oh, you want me to try and solve it anyway? Okay, let's see...<br><br>I think I should start by adding 2 and 5 because they're close together. That gets me 7.<br><br>Next, I should multiply 4 by 7 because it's in parentheses. That gives me 28.<br><br>Then, I should add 12 to 28 because it's the next number in the problem. That gives me 40.<br><br>Finally, I should subtract 2 times 3 because it's the last thing in the problem. That gets me 38.<br><br>The answer is 38.<br><br>Is that right? Did I do it correctly? Can you please explain PEMDAS to me now?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?<br><br>Wait, I think I know! We have to do the multiplication first, right? So 4 times 2 plus 5 is 4 times 7 which is 28.<br><br>Then we add 12, so that's 40.<br><br>Lastly, we subtract 2 times 3 which is 6.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, wow! This question looks a bit tricky! Let me see...<br><br>First, I think we should follow the rule of doing things inside the parentheses first. So, we need to find out what 2 + 5 is. Hmm... 2 + 5 equals 7!<br><br>Next, we have 4 times 7, which is 28.<br><br>Then, we have 12.<br><br>After that, we have to find out what 2 times 3 is. That's 6.<br><br>Lastly, we subtract 6 from 28, and that gives us... 22!<br><br>The answer is 22!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! So, let's see... <br><br>First, I know that when you have parentheses, you do what's inside them first. So, I'll start by adding 2 and 5. That gives me 7! <br><br>Next, I multiply 4 by 7, and that gives me 28. <br><br>After that, I add 12 to 28, and that gives me 40. <br><br>Finally, I subtract 2 times 3 from 40, and that gives me 34. <br><br>The answer is 34!</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm trying to solve this math problem, and I'm not sure what to do. It says 4*3 + 2. I know what the multiplication symbol means, so I think I'm supposed to multiply 4 and 3. That gives me 12. But then there's this plus sign, and I'm not sure what to do with it. I know it means add, but I don't know what to add. There's only one number left, which is 2. So, I think I'll just add 12 and 2, and that gives me... 14! The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...<br><br>Okay, I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll do the multiplication first.<br>4*3 = 12<br><br>Now, I have 12 + 2 = 14.<br><br>So, the answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think... Ok, I know I have to follow some rules to solve this problem. I remember my teacher said something about doing things in a special order.<br><br>First, I see a 5, and that's easy. It's just 5. Then, I see a 2 and a 4. My teacher said to do things inside the parentheses first, so I'll do 2 times 4, which is 8.<br><br>Now, I have 5 and 8. My teacher also said to do addition before multiplication, so I'll add 5 and 8, which is 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

I think I'll just do it in the order that makes sense to me.<br><br>Okay, so first, I'll do the multiplication: 3*2 = 6.<br><br>Then, I'll add 5 and 6: 5 + 6 = 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. I think it has something to do with following a certain order when doing math problems, but I'm not sure what that order is.<br><br>I think I'll just try to do the problem the way that makes the most sense to me. So, I'll start by adding 5 and 3, which gives me 8. Then, I'll multiply 8 by 2, which gives me 16.<br><br>So, the answer is 16.<br><br>I hope that's correct! If not, maybe someone can help me understand what I did wrong and how to do it correctly using PEMDAS.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to follow some rules when doing math, but I don't know what they're called. I think it's something like "PEMDAS"...? Anyway, let's see...<br><br>First, I think I'm supposed to do the multiplication part. So, 3 times 2 is... *thinks for a moment* 6!<br><br>Next, I think I'm supposed to do the addition part. So, 5 plus 6 is... *thinks for a moment* 11!<br><br>So, the answer is 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do some math problem, but I don't really know how. I mean, I know my numbers and stuff, but this thing with the symbols and stuff is a bit confusing. Like, what's the difference between + and *? And why do we have to do them in a certain order? It just seems like a bunch of random rules.<br><br>But whatever, I guess I'll try my best. So, the problem is 5 + 3*2, right? Okay, so first I'll do the multiplication, because that's what I was taught to do. So, 3*2 is 6. Now, I have to add 5 and 6, which is 11.<br><br>So, the answer is 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm supposed to solve this math problem, huh? Okay, let's see...<br><br>First, I notice that there are lots of numbers and symbols in the problem. I'm not really sure what to do with all those stars and plus signs, but I think I'm supposed to follow some rules or something.<br><br>I see that there are two numbers that are multiplied together, 7 and 2. I know how to do that! I can just multiply them together and get 14.<br><br>But then there's this other number, 8, and it's multiplied by 5. That's a bit tricky, but I think I can handle it. I multiply 8 and 5 and get 40.<br><br>Now, I'm not sure what to do next. Do I add 14 and 40? Or do I do something else? Hmm...<br><br>Oh, wait! I remember something my teacher said. She said that when you have lots of operations in a problem, you're supposed to follow a special order. It's like a secret code or something.<br><br>Okay, so I think the order goes like this: first, you do the multiplication, then you do the addition. Or is it the other way around? Hmm...<br><br>Well, I'll just try it both ways and see what happens.<br><br>So, if I do the multiplication first, that means I multiply 7 and 2, and then I multiply 8 and 5. That gives me 14 and 40.<br><br>Then, if I add 14 and 40, that gives me 54.<br><br>But wait, what if I do the addition first? That means I add 7 and 2, and then I add 8 and 5. That gives me 9 and 13.<br><br>Hmm... that doesn't seem right. I think I did something wrong.<br><br>Oh, I know! I'll just ask my teacher for help. She'll know what to do.<br><br>Teacher! Teacher! Help me out here!<br><br>Okay, my teacher just told me that I need to follow the order of operations. That means I need to do the multiplication first, then the addition.<br></td>
