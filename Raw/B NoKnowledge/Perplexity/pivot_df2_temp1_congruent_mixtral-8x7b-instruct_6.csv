mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Sure! I'll do my best to answer this math problem as a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations yet.

First, I would solve the operations inside the parentheses, which are addition and subtraction. There are no subtraction operations inside the parentheses, so I'll start by adding 2 and 5 to get 7. The equation now looks like this:
","GPT Response: Hi, I'm a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS). So, I'll solve this step by step.

First, I'll do the addition and subtraction inside the parentheses:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I'll do multiplication and division from left to right:

28 + 12 - 6

Finally, addition and subtraction from left to right:

40 - 6

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: I don't know about any order of operations rule, so I will just do the math from left to right. It seems like you can do the operations in different orders to get different answers, but I don't know about that.

First, I'll do the multiplication:

4 \* 2 = 8
and 
2 + 5 = 7, so
4 \* 7 = 28

Next, I'll do the addition:

28 + 12 = 40

Finally, I'll do the remaining multiplication:

40 - 2 \* 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: I don't know about any special rules for doing math, so I'll just do the operations in the order they appear, from left to right. This is sometimes called ""order of operations"" but I don't know that yet.

First, I'll do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.

Then, I'll multiply 4 by 7, because that comes next: 4 * 7 = 28.

Next, I'll do the subtraction: 28 - 12 = 16.

Lastly, I'll do the remaining multiplication: 16 * 3 = 48.

The answer is 48."

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will just solve this problem from left to right.

First, I will multiply 4 and 3, which equals 12.
Then, I will add the result to 2.
12 + 2 equals 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a curious elementary school student who doesn't know about order of operations yet, I would first think of solving this problem from left to right. So I would multiply 4 and 3, which equals 12. Then I would add the result to 2. That's 12 plus 2, which equals 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I would first draw stuff to help me solve this. I would draw a rectangle for the multiplication part, because multiplication is like putting together equal groups. So 4 times 3 is 12.

Then I see there's a plus sign, that means I have to add something. I have 12 from before, and there's a 2. I know how to add 2 to a number! So I count 2 steps forward from 12, and I get to 14.

The answer is 14."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: As a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think about doing the addition and multiplication at the same time since I don't know which one to do first. However, if I want to get an answer, I might just use a calculator to add 5 and 2 to get 7, then multiply that result by 4 to get 28. But I know that this might not be the correct way to do it, because sometimes you have to do multiplication before addition. So, I will try to learn more about this order of operations rule.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the addition and multiplication from left to right. 

So I would do 5 + 2 first, which is 7. Then I would do 7 * 4, which is 28.

So I would add 5 and 2 to get 7, then multiply that result by 4. Doing that gives me 28. But that's not the correct answer. 

After learning about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I now know that you should always do the multiplication and division before the addition and subtraction. So I should have done the multiplication of 2 and 4 first, then added the result to 5. That gives me 2 + 8, which is 11.

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I would first think that I can solve this problem from left to right. So I would add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then I would multiply that result by 4. If I do that, I get 28. But I've done it wrong, because I'm supposed to do the multiplication before the addition. If I do it that way, I get 13. So the answer is 13.

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the addition since that's what I'm used to. But I remember my teacher telling me that we have to follow certain rules when solving math problems.

In this problem, we have to do the multiplication before the addition. So I'll multiply 3 and 2 first to get 6, then add the result to 5.

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Well, as a student in elementary school, I don't really know about the order of operations. But I remember my teacher saying something about doing calculations in a certain order. I think it goes like this: first, you do any multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction. This is sometimes remembered by the abbreviation PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So for the problem 5 + 3*2, I would first do the multiplication part, which is 3*2. That equals 6.

Then, I would do the addition part, which is 5 + 6. And that equals 11.

So, the answer is 11."

Then, let's do the addition:
14 (which is the result of 7 times 2) plus 40 (which is the result of 8 times 5) equals 54.

In this question, there are no parentheses or exponents, so I look for multiplication and division first. I see that there are two multiplication operations: 7*2 and 8*5. I can do these at the same time because they're both multiplication.

So, 7*2 equals 14 and 8*5 equals 40. Now the equation looks like this: 14 + 40.

Then, I see there's addition, which is one of the last operations in PEMDAS. So, I add 14 + 40 and get 54.
