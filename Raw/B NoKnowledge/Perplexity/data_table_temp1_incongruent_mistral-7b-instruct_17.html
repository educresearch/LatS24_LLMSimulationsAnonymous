      <td>GPT Response: Well, according to my teacher, when doing math problems, we need to follow certain rules. These rules are called the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>Now, let's see if we can apply these rules to the problem at hand. We don't have any parentheses or exponents here, so we'll start with multiplication and division. In this case, we have 2 multiplied by 4, which equals 8.<br><br>So now we have 5 + 8. Addition comes before subtraction, so we'll do the addition next. <br><br>The answer is: 13 (This is the final result from adding 5 to 8)<br><br>So, the answer to the problem 5 + 2 * 4 according to the order of operations is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a sixth-grade student, I've never heard of the order of operations rule (PEMDAS). However, I can still try to solve this math problem by following some logical steps:<br><br>1. I see there is an addition sign (+) and a multiplication sign (*). Generally, we perform multiplication before addition (in my opinion based on the examples I've seen). So, I decide to do the multiplication first.<br><br>2. Following that logic, I first calculate 2 * 4 = 8.<br><br>3. Now, I have 5 + 8. This is an addition problem I'm comfortable with. I add 5 and 8 which results in 13.<br><br>So, my solution based on my limited knowledge and intuition is that the answer is 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure about any special rules for doing math problems. I would just do the addition first because that's what I see first in the problem. So, I would do 5 + 2, which gives me 7. Then, I would do the multiplication because that's the next thing I see. So, I would do 2 * 4, which gives me 8. Then, I would add the results of the addition and the multiplication together. So, 7 (from the addition) plus 8 (from the multiplication) gives me 15. The answer is __15__.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure about the rules for doing math problems, but I think I should do the multiplication first because I see a star (*) between 2 and 4. So, I'll do that: 2 * 4 equals 8. Then I have 5 + 8. Adding these numbers together gives me 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I know that when doing arithmetic, we generally do addition and subtraction before doing multiplication and division. But in this problem, we have both multiplication and addition. I'm not completely sure which one to do first. A more experienced mathematician would call this the Order of Operations, using the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (also from left to right). Basically, this rule tells us to do the calculations in this order: Parentheses, then Exponents, followed by Multiplication and Division, and finally Addition and Subtraction.<br><br>Applying PEMDAS to the given problem 5+3 * 2, the first step would be to do the multiplication: 3 * 2 = 6. After that, the addition: 5 + 6 = 11. The answer is __.<br><br>## The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I don't know about the order of operations yet. Let's do this multiplication first because I see it before the addition: 3 multiplied by 2 is 6. Now, let's do the addition: 5 plus 6 equals 11.<br><br>The answer is: 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm only an elementary school student, so I don't really know anything about the order of operations in math yet. But I think I should maybe do the multiplication before the addition, because the multiplication symbol (*) looks like it's supposed to be done before the addition symbol (+). So, let's try that:<br><br>First, I'll do 3 * 2: that equals 6.<br><br>Then, I'll add 5 to the result: 5 + 6. That equals 11.<br><br>So, here's what I think the answer should be: The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, I see some numbers and some symbols, but I don't really know what to do with them yet. Let me try to figure it out. I think I've heard that we're supposed to do multiplication before addition, but I'm not completely sure.<br><br>So, let's try that: we'll do the multiplication first. That's 3 times 2, which is 6.
