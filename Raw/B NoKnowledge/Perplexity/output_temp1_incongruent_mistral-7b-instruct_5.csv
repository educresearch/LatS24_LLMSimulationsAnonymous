But, I've heard that some calculations need to be done before others because of certain rules. Let's try to tackle this problem step by step:

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in this expression, so we'll move on to the next part.

2. Exponents: There are no exponents, so we'll continue.

3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right): There are two multiplication signs: 4 * (2+5) and 2 * 3. Let's do them one by one.

First, let's do the easy one: 2 * 3 = 6

Now, let's do 4 * (2+5). We need to add 2 and 5 inside the parentheses first: 
4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28

4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). There's one addition (2+5) and one subtraction (-2) left.

The sum of 2 and 5 is 7. So, we have:
28 (from 4 * (2+5)) + 12 - 2 * 3
= 28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, let's do the addition and subtraction:
28 + 12 = 40

systemPrompt4_userPrompt2_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: Well, I know that in mathematics we often have to follow certain rules when doing calculations, but I'm not quite sure what those rules are called just yet. But I'll try to do this calculation step by step, hoping I'm doing it the right way.

First, I see two multiplication signs, so I'll do those first.

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now I have two numbers: 14 and 40. And there's an addition sign between them. So I'll add those numbers together next.

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54."

But I'm just a little student, and I don't know anything about the special rules for doing math in a certain order yet. So, let's just do this problem step by step, the way it's written.

First, we do the multiplication: 4 times 3 equals 12.

Next, we do the addition: 12 (from the multiplication) plus 2 equals 14.

So, here's what I got:

The answer is 14."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: As a beginner elementary school student, I would approach this math problem by following the order that the symbols appear from left to right. However, let's make it clearer by giving simple names to each part of the equation:

A = 4 * (2+5)
B = 12-2 * 3

Now, let's solve each part:

Part A:
Follow the multiplication first, so it becomes:
A = 4 * (2+5)
A = 4 * (7)
A = 28

Part B:
Since subtraction is done before multiplication (follow the order from left to right, but multiplication and division have the same precedence and are done before addition and subtraction), we need to do 12 - 2 * 3:
B = 12 - 2 * 3
B = 12 - 6
B = 6

The final answer:
The answer is A + B = 28 + 6 = 34."

The plus sign (+) and the multiplication sign (+) look the same, but they mean different things. I think I should do the multiplication first, because the multiplication sign is usually written above the addition sign in texts and problems. So, I'll do 3 * 2 which is 6. Then, I'll add 5 to the result, so the solution is:

5 + 6

The answer is 11."
