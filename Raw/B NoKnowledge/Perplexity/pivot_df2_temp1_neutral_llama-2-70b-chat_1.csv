llama-2-70b-chat,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it my best shot. So, the problem is 4*(2+5)+12-2*3, right?

First, I'll start by multiplying 4 by 2+5. That's 4*7, which is 28.

Next, I'll add 12 to 28, which is 40.

After that, I'll subtract 2 times 3, which is 6.

So, my final answer is 40 - 6, which is 34.

The answer is 34!","GPT Response: Hi there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

Okay, so the first thing I see is 4 times 2 plus 5, that's 4 times 7, which is 28.

Then there's a plus sign, and I see 12. So, I add 28 and 12, and that's 40.

Next, I see a minus sign, and I see 2 times 3, which is 6. So, I subtract 6 from 40, and that's 34.

The answer is 34.

I hope that's right! Can you tell me if I did it correctly?","GPT Response: Okay, so we have this big equation: 4*(2+5)+12-2*3.

First, let's do the things inside the parentheses. That's 2+5, which is 7.

So, now we have 4*7+12-2*3.

Next, we do the multiplication. 4*7 is 28.

Then, we add 12, which makes 40.

Finally, we subtract 2*3, which is 6.

So, the answer is 40-6, which is 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Okay, let's see...

First, I know that when we have lots of numbers and operations in a math problem, we need to follow a special order to make sure we do everything correctly. It's like following a recipe!

So, the first thing I do is look for any parentheses. I see some! There's a 2+5 inside parentheses, so I need to do that first.

2+5 equals 7.

Now, I look for the next operation. I see a multiplication sign! I need to multiply 4 by 7.

4 times 7 is 28.

Next, I see a plus sign! I need to add 12 to 28.

28 plus 12 is 40.

Finally, I see a minus sign! I need to subtract 2 times 3 from 40.

40 minus 6 is 34.

The answer is 34!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that multiplying comes before adding, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 3. That gives me 12.

Then, I have 2 left over, so I'll add that to 12.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Okay! So, I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll do the multiplication first.
4*3 = 12

Now, I add 2 to 12:
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what this ""order of operations"" thing is, but I think I can help you with that question!

First, let's start with the multiplication part. 4 times 3 is 12.

Now, let's add 2 to 12, and that gives us 14.

So, the answer is 14!

I hope that's right! Do you think that's the correct answer?

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do something with numbers, but I'm not really sure what. I think I'm supposed to follow some sort of order, but I don't know what that means.

Okay, let's see... there are some numbers here: 4, 3, 2. I think I'm supposed to do something with them. Hmm... I know, I'll just follow the order they're in! That sounds good, right?

So, first I'll do 4 times 3, because that's what's next in the order. That's 12. Okay, got it. Then, I'll add 2 to 12, because that's the last thing in the order. That's 14!

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Oh, that's an easy one! We just have to follow the rules, right? So, first, we do the multiplications, which is 2 times 4, and that's 8. Then, we add 5 and 8, and that's 13. So, the answer is 13!

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: Hey there! So, I've got this math problem that says 5+2*4. Now, I'm not really sure what this * thing means, but I think it might be like a special way of adding numbers together.

So, I'm gonna start by adding 5 and 2 together, which gives me 7. Then, I've got this 4 thing that's stuck on the end of the 2, and I'm not really sure what to do with it.

I think maybe it's like a special kind of number that we haven't learned about yet, so I'm gonna pretend it's not there and just focus on the 7 that I got from adding 5 and 2 together.

So, the answer is... 7!

(P.S. I hope that was right! If not, could someone please help me figure out what I did wrong?)","GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that when we add numbers, we have to do it from left to right. So, first, I'll add 5 and 2, which gives me 7.

Then, I see that there's a multiplication sign, and I know that multiplication comes before addition. So, I'll multiply 4 by 2, which gives me 8.

Now, I have 7 and 8, and I need to add them together. So, I'll add 7 + 8, which gives me 15.

The answer is 15!","GPT Response: Sure, I can do that!

So, 5+2*4 means we have to add 5 and 2 times 4.

2 times 4 is 8, so we have to add 5 and 8.

5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Hmm, okay, so we have a bunch of numbers and symbols here. Let's see... we have a 5, a 3, a 2, and some multiplication and addition symbols. I think we're supposed to follow some rules to figure out what to do first.

Oh, I remember! My teacher said something about PEMDAS. That means we have to do the Parentheses first, then the Exponents, then the Multiplication and Division, and finally the Addition and Subtraction.

Okay, so let's see... there aren't any parentheses or exponents here, so we can skip those steps. Next, we need to do the multiplication. We have 3 times 2, which is 6.

Now, we need to add 5 and 6. That gives us 11.

So, the answer is 11.

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?

Okay, let's see... 5 + 3 is 8, and 3 * 2 is 6. So, if we add 8 and 6, we get 14!

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know I have to follow some rules to solve this problem. I think it's like a recipe, you have to do things in the right order. So, I'll start with the multiplication because that's what you do first when you're cooking.

3*2 = 6

Now, I have to add 5 to 6.

6 + 5 = 11

So, the answer is 11!

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Okay, so I know nothing about order of operations, but I know that multiplication comes before addition. So, I'll start by multiplying 3 and 2, which gives me 6. Then, I'll add 5 and 6, which gives me 11.

The answer is 11."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Hmm... I'm not sure how to solve this problem. I know I need to follow some rules, but I don't know what they are. I think I'll just do what makes sense to me.

First, I'll multiply 7 and 2. That gives me 14.

Next, I'll multiply 8 and 5. That gives me 40.

Now, I'll add 14 and 40. That gives me 54.

So, the answer is 54.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?

Okay, let me try. 7*2 is 14 and 8*5 is 40. Then, if I add them together, the answer is 54.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

First, I know that when we have multiplication and addition in a problem, we need to do the multiplication first. So, I'll start by multiplying 7 and 2. That gives me 14.

Next, I'll multiply 8 and 5, which gives me 40.

Now, I need to add 14 and 40, which gives me 54.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Hi! I'm a student in elementary school and I'm not sure what this ""order of operations"" thing is. But I'll do my best to solve this problem.

First, I see a bunch of numbers and symbols. Let me see... 7*2 means 7 times 2, which is 14. Then, there's a plus sign and some more numbers. 8*5 means 8 times 5, which is 40.

Now, I'm not sure what to do next. I know I have to add 14 and 40, but I don't know which one to add first. I think I'll just add them together and see what happens.

So, 14 + 40 = 54.

The answer is 54.

I hope that's right! Can someone please tell me if I did it correctly?"
