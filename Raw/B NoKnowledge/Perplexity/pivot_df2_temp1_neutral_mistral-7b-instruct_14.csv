mistral-7b-instruct,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I don't know much about the order of operations in mathematics yet. But I can try to solve this problem step by step based on what I see.

First, let's do the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.

Next, we'll do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28.

Then, add 12: 28 + 12 = 40.

Finally, subtract 2 * 3: 40 - (2 * 3) = 40 - 6 = 34.

So, following the order of operations I think I saw in a math book, the answer is:

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I have not learned about the order of operations yet, so I will attempt to solve this problem without knowing which symbol to do first. Let's just follow the sequence of the given expression from left to right and perform the Operations inside the parentheses first:

1. Solve the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7
2. Multiply the first and second numbers in the first multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28
3. Add the second multiplication: 12 - 2 * 3 = 12 - (2 * 3)
4. Multiply the numbers inside the second parentheses: 2 * 3 = 6
5. Subtract the result of the second multiplication from the first number: 12 - 6 = 6
6. Add the result of the first multiplication to the result of the third step: 28 + 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I'm not familiar with the order of operations in mathematics yet. But I can try to solve the problem step by step based on what I see. Let's call this the ""simple addition and multiplication first"" rule.

1. First, I'd do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.
2. Next, I'd do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28.
3. Finally, I'd do the subtraction: 28 + 12 = 40 and 40 - 2 * 3 = 38.

So, The answer is 38.","GPT Response: I don't know about order of operations yet, but I can still try to solve this problem step by step. let's do the additions first:

2 + 5 = 7

Then, do the multiplication:

4 * 7 = 28

Lastly, do the subtraction:

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure what the commutative and associative properties are or how order of operations works in mathematics. But this problem has the multiplication sign first, so I guess that means we do the multiplication first, then the addition. So, I'll do 4 times 3, which equals 12, and then add 2 to that.

The answer is 14.

So, 4*3+2 equals 14. Hopefully, that's the correct answer! But if it's not, then maybe someone who knows more about these rules can help us out.","GPT Response: Well, I don't know much about math yet, but my teacher told me that sometimes we need to follow certain rules when doing calculations. This is called order of operations, and it helps us get the correct answer. In this problem, we have to choose between multiplication and addition. My teacher said that we should do the multiplication first, then the addition. So, I'll start by calculating 4*3. That's 12. Now I'll do the addition. 12 + 2 equals 14.

The answer is __.
Answer: 14.","GPT Response: I'm just a young student, so I'm not yet familiar with the rules for solving mathematical expressions with multiple operations. But I can try to solve this problem by doing the simpler operations first. That is, I will do the multiplication first and then the addition.

So, let's do the multiplication:

4 * 3 = 12

And now, let's do the addition:

12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: I see numbers and signs on the board. The first thing I notice is that there are numbers and an addition sign (+) and a multiplication sign (*). I've heard that we do multiplication before addition, but I'm not sure why. So let's try that.

First, I'll do the multiplication:
4 * 3 = 12 (I remember that 4 times 3 equals 12)

Next, I'll do the addition sign:
12 + 2 = 14 (I add 12 and 2 to get 14)

So, the answer to the problem 4*3+2 is 14.

The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I haven't learned about order of operations yet. But I can try to solve it by guessing which operation to do first. I'll start with the addition because it looks simpler. So, I'll do 5 + 2, which gives me 7. Then, I'll do the multiplication with the result I got, which is 7 * 4. This means I multiply 7 by 4, and the answer is 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: As a 6th grade student, I haven't learned about the order of operations, so let's do this one step at a time! Let's start by doing the multiplication (2*4) and then add the result to 5. So, first, 2 multiplied by 4 equals 8. Then, 5 added to 8 equals 13.

The answer is __.
Answer: 13.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I haven't learned about the order of operations yet. I would follow what seems most logical to me, which is to do multiplication before addition. I would first multiply 2 and 4 to get 8, and then add 5 to get the final answer.

The answer is: 5 + 2*4 = 5 + 8 = 13.

However, I understand now that this is not the correct way to solve this problem according to the order of operations (PEMDAS). I will make sure to learn and follow the correct order in the future.","GPT Response: Well, I've seen numbers and some symbols, but I don't know their order yet. I'll try to do this in a way that seems logical to me. First, I'll do the multiplication because I see two numbers and a ""*"" sign, which looks like it means ""multiply"" to me. So, I'll find 2 times 4 and get 8. Then, I'll add the numbers I started with, which are 5 and 8. Let's see what that looks like: 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Well, I've heard adults talking about something called order of operations, but I don't really know what that means. I guess I'll just do this calculation step by step like I usually do. I'll start with the multiplication because I saw my teacher do that once.

So, 3 multiplied by 2 equals 6. Then, I'll add 5 to that result.

The answer is 6 + 5. (And my teacher said I'm getting smarter by the day!)","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I've learned how to do addition and multiplication, but I don't know about the order of operations yet. This problem consists of both addition and multiplication signs. Since I'm not sure which one to do first, let me ask my teacher for help.

[Asking the teacher]

Teamber: Based on the order of operations that you will learn in the future, you should perform multiplication before addition. So, let's do 3 multiplied by 2 first: 3 * 2 = 6. Now, we have 5 + 6.

[To myself]

So, I need to add 5 and 6, and the answer is 11.

[To the reader]

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about order of operations yet, I would approach this problem by doing the arithmetic operations from left to right, just as I've been taught. So, first I would do the multiplication: 3 multiplied by 2 equals 6. Then I would add 5 to the result: 5 plus 6 equals 11.

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: I'm not sure what to do first in this math problem because I've never learned about the order of operations in math class.
