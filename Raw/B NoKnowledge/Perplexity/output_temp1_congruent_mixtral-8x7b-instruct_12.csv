Looking at our question, 5 + 3*2, there are no parentheses or exponents. So we move on to multiplication which is then followed by addition. So we should do the multiplication part first.

3*2 equals 6.

So the answer is 14."

Then, I'll multiply 4 by 7 to get 28.

But I remember my teacher telling me that we have to follow some rules to make sure everyone does math the same way.

First, we do any operations with parentheses, but there are none here. Then, we do multiplication and division, because they are more important than addition and subtraction. Here, I see a multiplication: 3 times 2. So I do that part first.

3 times 2 is 6.

Now, I have 5 plus 6. I can do addition easily, so I get:

The answer is 11."
