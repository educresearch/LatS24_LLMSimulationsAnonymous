First, let's do the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.
So the expression becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we do multiplication and division from left to right: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6.
So the expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, we do addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40 and 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34."

I would first do the addition and then the multiplication because that's just how I would do it.

So, I would add 5 and 3 to get 8, and then multiply that result by 2.

8 times 2 equals 16.

The answer is 16."
