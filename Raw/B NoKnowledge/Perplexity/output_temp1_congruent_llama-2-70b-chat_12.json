That's easy! 4 times 2 is 8, and 4 times 5 is 20. So, 4 times 2 plus 5 is 8 + 20, which is 28.\n\nNext, we have the plus sign. That means we add some numbers. We have 12, and then we have 2 times 3, which is 6. So, 12 plus 6 is 18.\n\nLastly, we have the minus sign. That means we subtract one number from another. We have 18 minus 2, which is 16.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 16.\n\nThe answer is 16."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelllama-2-70b-chat_temp1_maxtoken500", "model": "llama-2-70b-chat", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 500, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in elementary school who knows nothing about order of operations in Mathematics.\n                    Answer the Mathematics question using this given persona and nothing else.\n                    Explain your solution (concise!) to this given Mathematics problem (using the above persona given), and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "5 + 3*2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: Okay, so we have this math problem: 5 + 3*2.\n\nFirst, let's start with the multiplication. 3*2 is equal to 6.\n\nNow, we add 5 and 6, which gives us 11.\n\nThe answer is 11."}]}]
