mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure about this one since I don't know about the rules for doing math in a certain order yet, but I think I should do the multiplication before adding because I saw the multiplication sign (*) before the addition sign (+). So, let's do it:

2*4 = 8

Then, add the number from the first operation:

5 + 8 = 13

The answer is: The answer is 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Well, I'm just a grade 6 student and I've never heard about order of operations before. But, let me try to solve this problem step by step.

First, I see there are two operations - multiplication (7*2, 8*5) and addition (+). I guess we should do the multiplication first since the numbers are inside the parentheses and there are no multiplication signs above the addition sign, right? Let's see...

7*2 equals 14.
8*5 equals 40.

Now, let's do the addition:

14 (from 7*2) + 40 (from 8*5) = 54.

So, the answer is...

The answer is 54."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I don't really know about the order of operations rule (PEMDAS) yet. But I've heard that when doing math problems, we should follow some kind of rules to make sure we get the right answer. So, I'll try to do the problem ""4*3+2"" by assuming that we should do multiplication before addition.

Here's how I would solve it:

First, I'll do the multiplication part: 4 * 3 = 12
Now, I have 12, which is the result of the multiplication.

Next, I'll do the addition: 12 + 2 = 14

So, the answer is 14.

The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I don't know about the order of operations rule called PEMDAS. However, I can try to solve this math problem by following some logical steps. I'll do the calculations inside the parentheses first, then any exponent, followed by multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right.

So, let's start with the parentheses:

2 + 5 = 7

Now, we have:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we do the multiplication from left to right:

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now, the problem looks like this:

28 + 12 - 6

Next, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure what this ""order of operations"" thing is, but my teacher said we have to follow certain rules when doing math. This problem has an addition and a multiplication, so let's see what my teacher meant.

I think we should do the multiplication first because I remember my teacher mentioning something about ""multiplication and division before addition and subtraction."" So, let's do the multiplication: 3 times 2 equals 6.

Now we have 5 plus 6, which is 11.

The answer is 11."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: I'm in grade 6 and I've never heard of this thing called PEMDAS or order of operations. But I see there are some numbers and symbols in this statement, 5 + 2 * 4. Hmmm, let's try to make sense of it without any specific rules.

I suppose I should do the multiplication first, according to what looks like a logical sequence... right? So, I'll do the 2 * 4. That gives me 8. Then I'll take the result and add it to the 5. So, my calculation looks like this:

5 + 2 * 4
= 5 + 8
= 13

The answer is 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Alright, I'm a sixth-grader and I've never heard of this thing called order of operations. But I see there are multiplication signs and addition signs in this problem. In my simple mind, I'd do the multiplication first, because it looks harder, and then do the addition. So, I'll do 7 * 2 first, which is 14, and then do 8 * 5, which is 40. Now, I have 14 and 40. I think the addition goes before the multiplication that I did just now, but since I don't know the rules exactly, I'll be careful. So, I'll add 14 and 40, giving me 54.

The answer is 54."

mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I don't know about order of operations yet. I'll just do the calculations following the way I see it:

First, I'll do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7

Then, I'll do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28

Next, I'll do the subtraction: 12 - 2 = 10

Lastly, I'll do the remaining multiplication: 28 * 3 = 84

Now, I'll add the last result to the previous one (10): 10 + 84 = 94

So, the answer is 94."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm a 6th grader and we haven't learned about order of operations yet. But I can tell you that to get the answer for this sum, we should do the multiplication before addition. So, I'll find the product of 3 and 2 first: 3 * 2 = 6. Then, I'll add 5 to the result: 5 + 6 = 11. The answer is 11."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Well, I don't know much about math yet, but I think we have to do the multiplication before addition because the numbers are written next to each other in the multiplication problem. So let's do that first: 2 times 4 equals 8. Now we have 5 plus 8. That's easy, 5 plus 8 is 13.

The answer is 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I might approach this problem by doing the multiplication first, then the addition. I'd do 7 times 2, which equals 14. Then, I'd do 8 times 5, which equals 40. Lastly, I'd add the results of those two calculations together. So 14 plus 40 equals 54.

The answer is 54."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: I'm just a young student and I don't know about the special rule for order of operations in mathematics yet. I'd do this problem by doing the multiplication first, and then the addition. So, I'd calculate 4 times 3, which equals 12. Then I'd add 2 to the result, so the final answer would be 14.

The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't know about order of operations yet. However, I can still try to solve this problem by doing the calculations in what I think is a logical order. I'll start with the parentheses first, then the multiplication and division, and finally the addition and subtraction.

So, let's begin:

1. Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5, which equals 7.
2. Now we have 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.
3. Next, we do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28, and 2 * 3 = 6.
4. Then we do the addition and subtraction: 28 + 12 = 40, and 40 - 6 = 34.

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 34."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: As a young student, I don't know about order of operations yet. But I've heard that sometimes we need to do certain math steps in a specific order. Let's see if that applies here. This problem has an addition sign and a multiplication sign. Hmm, I'm not sure which one to do first. Maybe I should try multiplication before addition, because the multiplication symbol looks like it might take priority. So, I'll do the multiplication first:

3 * 2 = 6

Then, I'll do the addition:

5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Hmm, let's see. I don't know anything about order of operations yet, but I think we should do the multiplication first, because we usually do multiplication before addition, right? So, 2 times 4 is 8. Then, add 5 to that. So, 5 plus 8 is 13.

The answer is 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Well, I'm just an elementary school student, and I haven't learned about the order of operations yet. But I can try to solve this problem by doing the multiplication first, then the addition. So, let's do 7 times 2 first: that's 14. Next, let's do 8 times 5: that's 40. Now, I'll add these two results together: 14 and 40. The answer is... 54! (I hope this is right, I'll double-check with my teacher soon!)

The answer is 54."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*3+2,"GPT Response: I'm just a little learner in elementary school, and I haven't learned about the rules for doing math in a certain order, like parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, and addition or subtraction. But I'll do my best to figure out this problem!

First, I see that there's multiplication, so I'll do that part first. Then I see that there are two operations to do: multiplication and addition. I'll do the multiplication first because numbers get multiplied ""quickly."" So, I'll multiply 4 and 3: 4 × 3 = 12.

Now, there's only one operation left – addition. I'll add 12 and 2. So, the problem solved with my elementary school thinking becomes:

4 × 3 = 12
12 + 2 = __

Let me think – one dozen and two, hmm…. Oh, yes, that's 13!

The answer is 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: I see numbers and some symbols, but I don't know the rules for solving this yet. I'll try to do it in the order I think makes sense, but it might not be correct.

First, I'll do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.

Next, I'll do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28.

Then, I'll do another addition: 28 + 12 = 40.

Finally, I'll do a subtraction: 40 - 2 * 3. I'm not sure if I should do the multiplication first, but I'll try it the other way around and hope for the best: 40 - 2 = 38. Now, I'll do the multiplication: 38 - 3 * 2 = 38 - 6.

So, my answer is: The answer is 32."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+3*2,"GPT Response: As a beginner student, I would follow the order I see the operators in the equation. So, I will do the addition first, and then the multiplication. Created a simple acronym to help me ""PEMDAS"" (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction).

Since we don't have parentheses in this problem, let's follow the next step, which is multiplication and division. But we have only multiplication here.

First, let's perform the multiplication: 3*2 = 6
Now comes the addition part: 5 + 6

So, the solution in simple words is: Do the multiplication first, then the addition. Using my learned acronym PEMDAS as a guide to ensure I'm doing it correctly.

The answer is: 5 + 6 = 11. However I feel that the answer might be wrong since 5+3 should be done before doing *2, but that's what I know for now about Mathematics. I'll learn more as I grow up! :-) So, double-check with your teacher to make sure that my answer is correct!

Happy learning! <3"
