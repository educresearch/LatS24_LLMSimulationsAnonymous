      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it my best shot.<br><br>Okay, so I see a bunch of numbers and symbols here. Let's start with the multiplication. I know that when you multiply numbers, you have to do it in a certain order. So, I'll start with the 4 and the 2+5. That gives me 4 * 7 = 28.<br><br>Next, I see the addition symbol, so I'll add 12 to 28, which gives me 40.<br><br>Now, there's this minus sign and some more numbers. I'm not sure what to do with them, but I think I have to subtract something. So, I'll subtract 2 times 3 from 40, which gives me 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.<br><br>I hope that's right! I'm not sure if I did the PEMDAS thing correctly, but I tried my best.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm trying to solve this math problem, and I'm not really sure how to do it. I've never heard of this "PEMDAS" thing before. Can you help me out?<br><br>Okay, so the problem is 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3. Let's see... I know that 2+5 is 7, so that part is easy. And 12 is just a number. But then there's this weird symbol, the multiplication sign, that I don't really understand. Oh, and there's another one! And it's followed by a number! Confusing!<br><br>I think I'll just do what makes sense to me. I'll start by multiplying 4 by 7, because that's what the problem says to do first. That gives me... (wait, let me count it out on my fingers) 28!<br><br>But wait, there's more! The problem says to add 12 to that, so I'll do that. 28 + 12 = 40.<br><br>Now, I see this other part of the problem that says 2 * 3. I don't know what that's doing there, but it looks like it's trying to trick me. I'll just ignore it for now and hope it goes away.<br><br>So, my answer is 40. The answer is 40.<br><br>(And, um, I hope that 2 * 3 thing doesn't cause too many problems later on. Maybe someone can help me understand it someday?)</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll try my best to solve the problem!<br><br>First, I see a bunch of numbers and signs, so I'll just follow the signs and do what they say.<br><br>* I see a multiplication sign, so I'll do that first. 4 * 2 is 8, and 4 * 5 is 20.<br>* Next, I see a plus sign, so I'll add 8 and 20, which is 28.<br>* Then, I see another plus sign, so I'll add 12 to 28, which is 40.<br>* Finally, I see a minus sign, so I'll subtract 2 times 3 from 40, which is 36.<br><br>The answer is 36!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm just a kid in elementary school, and I'm not sure what this "order of operations" thing is all about. But I'll give it my best shot!<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 multiplied by something. That something looks like 2 plus 5, which is 7. So, I multi-ply 4 by 7, and I get 28.<br><br>Next, I see a 12. I don't know what to do with it, but it looks like it's just hanging out there by itself. So, I'll just leave it alone for now.<br><br>Now, I see a minus sign! That means I have to subtract something, right? I see 2 times 3, which is 6. So, I subtract 6 from 28, and I get 22.<br><br>But wait, there's more! I see a plus sign too! That means I have to add something. I see a 12 hanging out there, so I'll add it to 22. That gives me 34.<br><br>The answer is 34!<br><br>I hope that's right, and I hope I didn't mess up anywhere. I'll ask my teacher to check my work!</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm supposed to solve this math problem, right? It looks like this: 4 * 3 + 2. Now, I know what you're thinking, "What's the big deal? It's just a simple math problem!" But hold up, let me tell you, it's not that easy! See, I don't know this "order of operations" thingy you're talking about.<br><br>Okay, so I know what the numbers are, and I know what the signs mean. There's this multiplication sign, which means you have to multiply two numbers together. Then there's this addition sign, which means you gotta add two numbers together. But here's the thing, what order do I do them in? Do I multiply first, or do I add first? That's where this "PEMDAS" thing comes in, I guess.<br><br>So, I'm gonna start by multiplying 4 and 3 together, 'cause that's what the multiplication sign tells me to do. That gives me 12. Now, I gotta add 2 to that, so I get 14. And that's my answer! Woohoo! The answer is 14.<br><br>But wait, you're saying that's not right? That I gotta follow this "order of operations" thingy? Okay, okay, I hear ya. So, I gotta follow these steps: first, I gotta multiply 4 and 3 together, then I gotta add 2 to that. Which means... uh... okay, so that's 12 + 2, which is... *drumroll* 14!<br><br>The answer is 14! Yay, I did it! I hope that's right, 'cause I don't wanna mess up again!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. I think it might be a magic word that math people use, but I'm not sure.<br><br>So, I'm just going to do it my way. First, I'll multiply 4 and 3, which is 12. Then, I'll add 2 to 12, which is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, let's see... 4 times 3 is 12, and then we add 2, so that's 12 + 2, which is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

So, I think I need to follow those steps in that order.<br><br>First, I don't see any parentheses, so I can skip that step.<br>Next, I don't see any exponents either.<br>Then, I see a multiplication sign, so I need to do that next. 2 times 4 is 8.<br>After that, I don't see any division signs, so I can skip that step.<br>Then, I see an addition sign, so I need to add 5 and 8.

That's the big word for when you have numbers that are close together, like 2 and 4. So, 2 times 4 is... hmm... 8! That's right, 2 times 4 is 8.<br><br>Now, after I do the multiplication, I need to add the other number. That's 5. So, 5 plus 8 is... 13!
