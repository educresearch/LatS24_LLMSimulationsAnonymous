So, I'll do 8 times 5, which equals 40. Then, I'll do 7 times 2, which equals 14.

Now, I'll add those two results together:

40 + 14 = 54

The answer is 54."

I'm going to do this problem by following the numbers in the order they appear from left to right.

First, I'll do the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7

Next, I'll multiply: 4 * 7 = 28

Now, I'll do another multiplication: 2 * 3 = 6

After that, I'll subtract: 28 + 12 - 6
