      <td>GPT Response: Well, I've got this math problem here: 4 times 3, and then add 2. I'm not really sure which one to do first, so I better ask my teacher. (Hey Mrs. Johnson, which operation do I do first, multiplication or addition, in this problem 4*3 + 2? Thanks!)<br><br>She tells me that I should do the multiplication first, according to some math rules called order of operations or PEMDAS. So I'll do that:<br><br>First, do the multiplication: 4 times 3 equals 12<br><br>Now, the problem looks like this: 12 + 2<br><br>Next, do the addition: 12 + 2 equals 14<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what those weird letters and numbers mean, but my teacher once told me that we have to follow certain rules when doing mathematics problems. Let's see...There's something called "multiplication" and "addition" or "subtraction" signs. I think they call it "order of operations" or something like that. So, according to my teacher, I need to do any multiplication first, then addition or subtraction in the order it appears. In this problem, I see multiplication with the numbers 4 and 3, so I should do that first:<br><br>4 * 3 = 12<br><br>Now I have 12, and there's an addition sign with the number 2:<br><br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I see numbers and two symbols, a star and a plus sign. I don't know what to do first because in my elementary school they haven't taught us the order of operations yet. Let me try doing the addition before the multiplication to see what happens.<br><br>So, the first step I'll do is the addition: 4 * 3 + 2<br><br>Now, let's do the multiplication: 12 (the result of 4 * 3) + 2<br><br>Lastly, perform the addition again: 12 + 2<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just a sixth grader and I've never heard of this thing called PEMDAS for order of operations. But I think I can still try to solve this problem. Remember, I'm just a kid.<br><br>Let's start with what's in the parentheses, but there's none here so I guess we skip that part. Next, we have addition (5) and multiplication (2*4), but which one do we do first? I don't know, but maybe we should do the multiplication because the asterisk (*) looks like it means "times" to me. So, let's do that: 2*4 equals 8.<br><br>Now, we have the addition: 5 + 8. Hmm, I know how to do that one - just add the numbers together: 5 + 8 equals 13.<br><br>The answer is: The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a 6th grade student, I don't know about the order of operations yet, but I can still try to solve this problem. Let's do it step by step:<br><br>1. I see there's an addition sign (5 +) and a multiplication sign (2 * 4). I'll do the multiplication first because the numbers are next to each other, right?<br>2. So I have 2 * 4. I know that means I have to multiply 2 and 4 together: 2 x 4 = 8.<br>3. Now I have 5 + 8. I think adding takes place before the multiplication if there are parentheses or something, but since there aren't any, I guess has to be done next since we saw it first.<br>4. I'll add 5 and 8: 5 + 8 = 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm an elementary school student and I don't really know about the special rules for mathematical operations yet.

I'll just put the numbers that need to be added together: 5 and 8. That makes 13.<br><br>So, here's the step-by-step solution:<br>1. 2 * 4 = 8<br>2. 5 + 8 = 13<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

Here's what I'd do:<br><br>1. I'd start with addition because it looks simpler to me and it's usually what I do first with numbers in my everyday life. So, I'd added 5 and 3.<br>2. Then, I'd move on to the multiplication symbol (*) because it seems a bit more complicated and I think it might have something to do with making things bigger or smaller. So, I'd multiply 3 and 2.<br>3. Now, I have two results and I'd need to figure out how to combine them. So, I'd try the multiplication result with the addition result to see what that gives me.<br><br>So the final answer would be:<br><br>5 + 3*2<br>= 5 + (3 * 2)<br>= 5 + 6<br>= 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
