4 x 3 = 12

Now, we add 2 to 12:

12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14."

First, I see some numbers that are multiplied together, so I'll start by doing those. 4 times 2 is 8, and 8 times 5 is 40.

Next, I see a plus sign, so I'll add 12 to 40. That gives me 52.

Now, I see a minus sign, so I'll subtract 2 times 3 from 52. That's 6.

Finally, I have my answer! The answer is 46.

I hope that's right! Can someone please tell me if I did it correctly? ðŸ˜…"
