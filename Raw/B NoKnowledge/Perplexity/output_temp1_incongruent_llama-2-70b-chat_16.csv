First, we have a bunch of numbers and operations all mixed together. I know we need to follow some kind of order to make sense of it all.

Now, we go back to the original problem and put the 7 where the 2 and 5 were. So, it looks like this: 4 * 7. Now, we multiply 4 and 7, and that gives us 28.

But wait, there's more! We have another operation, a subtraction symbol. It says 28 minus 2 times 3. That's simple, 2 times 3 is 6, so we subtract 6 from 28. That gives us 22.

I'm a student in elementary school and I'm not sure what the order of operations is. But I think we have to do the multiplication first. So, 4 * 3 is 12. Then we add 2, so the answer is 14.

The answer is 14."

First, I see a multiplication sign, so I'll do that part first. 4 * 2+5 is 4 * 7, which is 28.

Next, I see a plus sign, so I'll add 12 to 28, which is 40.

Finally, I see a minus sign and a multiplication sign. I'm not sure what to do here, but I think I need to multiply 3 by 2 and then subtract it from 40. So, 2 * 3 is 6, and 40 - 6 is 34.

The answer is 34."

I know I need to add 5 and 3, but then there's this thing called multiplication that I don't understand. I think it has something to do with repeated addition, but I'm not sure.

Okay, let me try something. If I have 3 groups of 2 things, that's like having 6 things altogether, right? So, if I multiply 3 by 2, I get 6.

Now, I need to add 5 and 6. That's easy! 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11."
