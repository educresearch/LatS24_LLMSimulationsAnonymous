I'll just do this problem following the sequence of numbers as they appear from left to right:<br><br>1. First, I'll do the multiplication: 4 * (2 + 5)<br>2. Next, I'll do the addition inside the parentheses: 4 * (7)<br>3. Then, I'll do another multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28<br>4. Now, I have 28, and there's another addition: 28 + 12<br>5. And then, there's another subtraction: 40 (the result of the previous addition) - 2*3<br>6. Multiply: 2*3 = 6<br>7. Subtract: 40 - 6 = 34<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm not familiar with the order of operations in mathematics yet.

      <td>GPT Response: Hmmm, I've got this math problem here: 4 times 3, plus 2. I think I'll do the multiplication first, because the numbers are smaller, and then add the result to the number 2.

      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about order of operations, I would do the calculation by following the way the symbols are written from left to right and inside the parentheses first.

      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I have not learned about the order of operations in mathematics yet. But I can try to solve this problem based on what I know about addition and multiplication.<br><br>First, I see that there is an addition sign and a multiplication sign together in one expression. I've heard that when there are two or more operations in one line, you should do the multiplication first, and then do the addition. So that's what I'll try to do.<br><br>Therefore, I will do the multiplication operation first, which is 2 * 4 = 8. Then I'll do the addition operation, which is 5 + 8.<br><br>So, the calculation will be like this:<br><br>2 * 4 = 8 (multiplication)<br>5 + 8 = 13 (addition)<br><br>Now that I've done both the multiplication and the addition, I can give you the answer:<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm in grade 6 and I've never heard of something called PEMDAS or order of operations. But let's try to figure this out. Since addition and multiplication are both there, possibly we should do one then the other? I guess, I'll do the multiplication first because the * symbol is there. So, 2 multiplied by 4 is 8. Now, I have 5 and 8. I know, I can add those numbers together! So, 5 plus 8 equals 13.<br><br>The answer is: 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't really know about the order of operations in mathematics yet. But I think I can try to solve this problem by doing the multiplication first, then adding the results to the number on the left. So, I'll calculate 2*4 which equals 8, and then add 5 to get the final answer.<br><br>The answer is: 5 + 2*4 = 5 + 8 = 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a third-grader, I've learned how to add and multiply numbers, but I haven't learned about the order of operations yet. So let's just do the addition and multiplication one at a time.<br><br>First, I'll do the multiplication: 2*4 equals 8.<br><br>Next, I'll do the addition: 5 (that's what's left after subtracting the multiplication from the original problem) plus 8.<br><br>That equals 13, so my answer is:<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm not familiar with the rule of order of operations in mathematics, which is often represented by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction). When I encounter an expression with multiple operations, I usually follow this simple guideline:<br><br>1. Perform any operations inside parentheses or in brackets.<br>2. Calculate any exponents or square roots.<br>3. Perform multiplication and division from left to right to the best of my ability.<br>4. Lastly, I perform addition and subtraction from left to right.<br><br>Until now, I haven't recognized any parentheses, exponents, or scientific notation in the expression given: 5 + 3*2. So, as a grade 6 student, I would evaluate the multiplication (3*2) first and then add the results to the number 5.<br><br>Therefore,<br>3*2 = 6<br>5 + 6 = 11<br><br>So, the answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a 6th grade student, I've not learned about the order of operations in mathematics yet. Let's try to solve this problem step by step:<br><br>1. I see the multiplication sign (3*2) first, so let's do that one: 3 * 2 = 6<br>2. Now, there's only addition left: 5 + 6<br>3. I'll add those numbers: 5 + 6 = 11<br><br>The answer is 11.<br><br>(Note: This answer is incorrect as per the standard order of operations or "PEMDAS," but this is the best a grade 6 student, unaware of PEMDAS, could do.)</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what those strange symbols mean. But I think we should do the multiplication first, because it has a little star next to it. So, let's do that: 3 multiplied by 2 equals 6. Now we need to add the number we started with, which is 5, to the result we got. So, 5 plus 6 equals 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure what to do here, since I don't know anything about order of operations in mathematics yet. But I can try to guess based on what I know about addition and multiplication. I think I should do the multiplication first, because I've seen that in some problems, and then add the results. So, let's try that:<br><br>First, I'll do the multiplication: 3*2 equals 6.<br><br>Next, I'll add 5 to the result of the multiplication: 5 + 6.<br><br>Now, let's do the addition: 5 + 6 equals 11.<br><br>So, the answer is:<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>

I've heard my teacher mention something called order of operations, but I'm not exactly sure what it means yet. Let's see if we can do this problem step by step and maybe figure it out as we go.<br><br>First, I think we should do the mathematical operations inside the parentheses if there are any. But in this problem, there are no parentheses. So let's move on to the next rule: exponents. I don't see any exponents here though.<br><br>The next rule is multiplication and division. Both 7 and 8 are numbers, so they're not division, and the "*" symbol means multiplication.
