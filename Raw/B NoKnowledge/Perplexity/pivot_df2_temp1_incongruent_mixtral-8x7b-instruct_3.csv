mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: I don't know about any special rules like PEMDAS yet, so I'll just do the operations in the order they appear, from left to right.

First, I'll do the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.

So the expression becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Now I'll do the multiplication and addition: 4 times 7 is 28, and 2 times 3 is 6.

So the expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 6

Finally, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 6 equals 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Hi! I'm a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS) yet. When I see a math problem like this, I would solve it from left to right and do all the operations that come first, which are addition and subtraction. But let's see if doing it that way gets the correct answer.

First, I'll do the operation inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5. That equals 7.

So the expression now becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I'll do the multiplication and addition from left to right:

4 * 7 = 28, so the expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3

28 + 12 = 40, so the expression becomes: 40 - 2 * 3

40 - 2 = 38, so the expression becomes: 38 * 3

But wait, I think I remember my teacher mentioning something about the order of operations, like parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). I think I should have followed that rule instead. Let me try doing it that way:

First, parentheses: (2 + 5) = 7

Next, multiplication and division (from left to right): 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6

Lastly, addition and subtraction (from left to right): 28 + (-6) = 22

So, I think I was wrong with my first answer:

The answer is 22.","GPT Response: If I was given the math problem ""4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3"" and I didn't know about order of operations, I would solve it from left to right. Here's how I would do it:

First, I would do the operation inside the parentheses, which is addition: 2 + 5 = 7.

Next, I would do multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6.

Then, I would do addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40 and 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: If I were trying to solve this problem, I would first look for any parentheses or grouping symbols to see if there are any calculations I should do first. In this case, I see that there are addition and subtraction in the same expression as multiplication, so I would need to remember the order of operations.

First, I would do the operations inside the parentheses, which is adding 2 + 5. That equals 7.

Next, I would do the multiplication. I see that there are two multiplication operations, but I should do them in order from left to right. So, I would first multiply 4 by 7, which gives me 28. Then, I would multiply 2 by 3, which gives me 6.

Finally, I would do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So, I would add 28 and 12, which gives me 40. Then, I would subtract 6 from 40, which gives me 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the multiplication and addition from left to right. So I would first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12, and then add 2 to get 14. But I heard from my teacher that there is a special rule in mathematics when it comes to operations, and it's called PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this problem, there are no Parentheses, Exponents, or Division, so we just need to follow the order of Multiplication and Addition. According to PEMDAS, I should do the Multiplication first before the Addition. So I should multiply 4 and 3 first to get 12, and then add 2 to get 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will solve this problem step by step.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: As a 6th grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the multiplication and addition from left to right. 

So I would first multiply 7 and 2, which gives 14. Then I would add 8 to it because that's the next operation. Adding 8 to 14 gives 22. 

Next, I would multiply 2 (from 8 * 2) by 5, which gives 10. Then I would multiply that result by 8, which gives 80.

Now I have two answers: 22 and 80. But since I didn't know about the order of operations, I would have given the answer based on how the problem was written, which is 22.

However, if I were following the rules of order of operations (PEMDAS), I would have done the multiplication first (8 * 5), then the multiplication (7 * 2), and finally the addition (22 + 40), resulting in the correct answer of 62. 

The answer is 22 (if not following order of operations).","GPT Response: Well, as a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think about doing the multiplication and addition from left to right. 

First, I would multiply 7 by 2, which gives me 14. Then, I would multiply 8 by 5, which gives me 40. After that, I would add the two results together.
