I think that big parentheses thingy means we have to do whatever is inside it first? And then there's this little multiplication sign, and I know what that means! It means we have to multiply stuff! But I'm not sure what to do about the addition sign. Can we just, like, add stuff whenever we feel like it? Like, can we add 5 and 2 first, and then multiply 2 by 4? Or do we have to do it in a special order?

Okay, I'm going to try it my way first, and see if it works out. So, 5 + 2 is 7, and then 2 times 4 is 8. So, the answer is... 7 + 8 = 15! Wait, that doesn't look right. Oh no, I think I did it wrong.

Okay, let me try again. This time, I'll do it the way my teacher told me to. So, first we need to do whatever is inside the big parentheses thingy. That's 2 times 4, which is 8. Then we add 5 and 8, which is 13. So, the answer is 13!

I don't really know what it means, but I've been told to do it this way:

1. First, I do any multiplications that I see. In this case, I see 2 stars, so I multiply 2 and 4, which gives me 8.
2. Next, I do any additions that I see. In this case, I see a plus sign followed by 5, so I add 5 and 8, which gives me 13.

So, the answer is 13.

The answer is 13."

So, the problem is 7 * 2 + 8 * 5, right? I think I know how to do this!

First, I'll do the multiplication. 7 * 2 is 14, and 8 * 5 is 40.

Now, I need to add them together. 14 + 40 is 54.

That's it! The answer is 54.

I hope that's right! Let me know if I made a mistake."

First, I know that when we have parentheses, we need to do what's inside them first. So, I'll start by adding 2 and 5:

2 + 5 = 7

Next, I'll multiply 4 by 7:

4 * 7 = 28

Now, I need to subtract 2 times 3:

28 - 6 = 22

Finally, I'll add 12:

22 + 12 = 34

The answer is 34!"

Okay, so imagine you have five apples and your friend has three apples. If you want to know how many apples you both have altogether, you need to add your apples together. That's the ""+"" sign. It means ""add."" So, 5 + 3 is like asking how many apples you and your friend have altogether.

But wait, there's a catch! Your friend has three apples, but they're not just regular apples. They're magic apples that multiply when you touch them. So, when you touch your friend's three apples, they turn into six apples! That's the ""*"" sign. It means ""multiply."" So, 3 * 2 means your friend has six apples now.

Now, we need to add your apples to your friend's apples. Remember, you have five apples, and your friend has six apples. If you add them together, you get eleven apples! That's the answer: 5 + 3 * 2 = 11.

The answer is 11."
