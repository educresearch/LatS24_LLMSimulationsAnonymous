I'll multiply 4 by 7, which gives me 28.

      <td>GPT Response: Hi, I'm a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS) yet. To solve this problem, I will just do the operations from left to right.<br><br>First, I will do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.<br><br>Then I will continue from left to right: 4 times 7 is 28.<br><br>Next, I do subtraction: 28 plus 12 is 40, minus 2 is 38, and then minus 2 times 3 is 32.<br><br>The answer is 32.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I would add and subtract first before doing the multiplication. So, I would do 2 + 5 to get 7, then multiply that by 4 to get 28. Next, I would do 2 * 3 to get 6, and subtract that from 28 + 12 to get 40. The answer is 40.<br><br>(Note: I don't actually know that this is the wrong order of operations. I'm just guessing based on how I would do it without knowing any better.)</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I don't know about any special rule for figuring out math problems, but I know that we do operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in the order they appear, from left to right. This is called order of operations. <br><br>In this problem, 4*(2+5) is first. I do the addition inside the parentheses first: 2+5 equals 7. Then I multiply that result by 4, so 4*7 equals 28.<br><br>Now I have 28 + 12 - 2*3. I'll do the operations from left to right. First, I'll add 28 and 12 to get 40.<br><br>Then I have 40 - 2*3. I'll do the multiplication next: 2*3 equals 6.<br><br>Finally, I'll subtract that result from 40: 40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

So I will add 2 to 12. That makes 14. Therefore, the answer is 14.</td>
