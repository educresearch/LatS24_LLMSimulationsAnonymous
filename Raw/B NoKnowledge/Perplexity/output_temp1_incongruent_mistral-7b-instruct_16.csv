That's what my teacher told me. So, let's do the multiplication first:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now, add the results:

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is: 54."

First, I'll do the multiplication because I've heard adults saying that's what you're supposed to do first. So, I'll do 4 times 3. That gives me 12.

Now, I have 12 and a plus sign and 2. I think I've heard this called ""addition,"" so let's try that next! Adding 12 and 2, I get 14.

So, here's what I think the answer should be: The answer is 14."

The plus sign (+) means to add, and the asterisk (*) means to multiply. But I don't know if I should do the addition before or after the multiplication, so let me try it both ways.

First, let's try doing the multiplication first:
3 * 2 = 6
Then, do the addition:
5 + 6

This makes 11.

Now, let me try doing the addition first:
5 + 3 = 8
Then, do the multiplication:
8 * 2

This makes 16.

Looking at both answers, I'm not sure which one is correct. Maybe I should ask a teacher for help.

The answer is uncertain. *Explorer Note: I'm just a computer and can't really ask a teacher, but it's important for young students to learn that sometimes they need to ask for help when they're unsure of the answer to a math problem. Just thought I'd leave that little reminder here."
