      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not exactly an expert on mathematics at the moment. But, I think I can try to solve this problem step by step based on what I've learned in class. The teacher mentioned that there is a rule called PEMDAS which determines the order of operations. It stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>Let's see how it goes for our problem:<br><br>1. There are no parentheses or exponents in our equation, so we'll move on to the next step.<br>2. We have two multiplication signsç‰›, so we need to do those first (according to the "Multiplication and Division" part of PEMDAS).<br><br>   The problem is: 4 * 3<br><br>   We'll do this multiplication first:<br><br>   4 * 3 = 12<br><br>3. Now we have an addition operation left:<br><br>   The problem is: 12 + 2<br><br>   According to the "Addition and Subtraction" part of PEMDAS, we'll do additions from left to right.<br><br>   Since we only have one addition sign plus, we'll do this addition next:<br><br>   12 + 2 = 14<br><br>So, the answer is: The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm not familiar with the order of operations yet. But I can tell you that when we do arithmetic, we usually follow a certain rule to make sure we get the correct answer. In this problem, we have multiplication and addition. The rule I know is to do the multiplication first, then the addition. So, I'll do the multiplication: 4*3 = 12 then add 2: 12 + 2 = 14<br><br>The answer is __14__.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just a little kid and I don't know the rules for this yet, but let's try to solve it step by step. I think we should do multiplication before addition.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I see some numbers and some symbols up here. I think we're supposed to do something with them. Let's start by doing the multiplication, because I see some numbers being multiplied. So, I'll do 4 times 3, which makes 12. Now, I have 12 and a plus sign and the number 2. Hmm, I've heard about this before. I think I need to do the addition last, because I saw my teacher do it that way once. So, I'll add 12 and 2. The answer is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure what the symbols mean here, but my teacher told me that we have to follow certain rules when doing mathematical operations. Let's see, there's something called PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>Looking at the given problem, I don't see any parentheses or exponents.

That's just how I rolls! So, let's give that a shot.<br><br>First, I'll do the multiplication: 3*2 equals 6.<br><br>Now, I'll substitute that back into the equation and do the addition: 5 + 6 equals 11.<br><br>So, that's it!

      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I have not learned the order of operations yet. So, I would do the addition and multiplication at the same time and follow what looks easier to me. I would do the multiplication first since the numbers are smaller and then do the addition.<br><br>The answer is: 3*2 = 6, 5 + 6 = 11.<br><br>So, The answer is 11.
