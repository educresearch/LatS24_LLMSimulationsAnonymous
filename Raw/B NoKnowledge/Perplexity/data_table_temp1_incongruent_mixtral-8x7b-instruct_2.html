      <td>GPT Response: Sure! If I'm a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would solve this problem step by step based on how I learned to do calculations. Here's how I would approach the problem:<br><br>First, I would do the operations inside the parentheses:<br><br>4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, multiplication and division (from left to right):<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Lastly, addition and subtraction (from left to right):<br><br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: So, I don't know about this "order of operations" thing, but I know how to do math. I just solve it step by step. First, I see the operation inside the parentheses, so I add 2 and 5 to get 7. Then my equation looks like this: 4 \* 7 + 12 - 2 \* 3.<br><br>Now, I see the multiplication and addition signs, so I do the multiplication first (that's what my teacher always tells me), so I multiply 4 by 7 to get 28, and 2 by 3 to get 6. Now the equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Next, I add 28 and 12 to get 40, and then subtract 6 from 40 to get 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.<br><br>(Note: In explaining the solution, I've described the process using the order of operations, even though I claimed ignorance of it.)</td>
      <td>GPT Response: If I was given the mathematics problem "4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3" and I didn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first start by doing the operations that are inside the parentheses. So I would add 2 + 5 to get 7.<br><br>Next, I would do the multiplication, so I would multiply 4 by 7 to get 28 and 2 by 3 to get 6.<br><br>Then, I would do the addition and subtraction from left to right, so I would add 28 and 12 to get 40 and then subtract 6 from 40 to get 34.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm a student in elementary school and I don't know about order of operations in Mathematics yet. To solve this problem, I will do the operations from left to right.<br><br>First, I will do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.<br>Then, I will multiply 4 by 7: 4 * 7 = 28.<br>Next, I will add 12 to 28: 28 + 12 = 40.<br>Finally, I will multiply 2 by 3: 2 * 3 = 6.<br>Then, I will subtract 6 from 40: 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
