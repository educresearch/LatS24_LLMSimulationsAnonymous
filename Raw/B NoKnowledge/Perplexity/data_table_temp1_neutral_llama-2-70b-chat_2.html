      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll give it my best shot!<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is 4*2, which is 8. Then there's a plus sign and a 5, so that's 8+5, which is 13. Wait, there's more! There's a plus sign again and a 12. Hmm, 13+12 is 25.<br><br>Oh, but there's a minus sign and a 2*3, which is 6. So, 25 minus 6 is 19.<br><br>The answer is 19!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 multiplication symbol. I know that means I have to multiply 4 and the number that comes after it. The number after it is 2+5, so I'll do that first. 2+5 is equal to 7, so now I have 4 times 7, which is 28.<br><br>Next, I see the addition symbol (+) and the number 12. I know I have to add 12 to 28, so that's easy. 28 + 12 = 40.<br><br>Now, there's a subtraction symbol (-) and the number 2 times 3, which is 6. I have to subtract 6 from 40, so that's easy too. 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>So, the answer is 34!<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey, I've never heard of this PEMDAS thingy, but I'll try my best to solve this math problem!<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 multiplication symbol, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 2+5.

That's 2 times 3 is 6, so I'll subtract 6 from 40, which gives me 34.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 34! üòÅ</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, let's see...<br><br>First, we need to do the multiplication: 4 * (2 + 5) = 4 * 7 = 28.<br><br>Next, we need to add 12: 28 + 12 = 40.<br><br>Finally, we need to subtract 2 times 3: 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?<br><br>Okay, let me try. 4*3 is 12, right? And then there's a plus sign and a 2. So, 12 + 2 is 14. The answer is 14.<br><br>Is that right? Did I do it correctly?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this problem for a bit. Okay, I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 3. That gives me 12. Then, I'll add 2 to 12, which makes 14. So, the answer is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so we have this big complicated problem: 5+2*4. Let's see... <br><br>First, we have the 5. That's easy. It's like, the number after 4. So, that's simple. <br><br>Next, we have the 2. Now, that's a little trickier. It's like, the number after 1. But then, we have the *4. <br><br>Hmm...what's that do? Well, it means we have to multiply 2 by 4. That's like...8! Yeah, because 2 times 4 is 8. <br><br>So, put it all together, and we get...11! Yeah, because 5 plus 8 is 11.
