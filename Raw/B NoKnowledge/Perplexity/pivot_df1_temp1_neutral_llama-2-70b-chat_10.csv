llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a 6th grader and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll give it my best shot!

Okay, so I see a 5 and a 2 and a 4. I know I have to add the 5 and the 2 first because they're next to each other. That's 7. Then I have to multiply the 2 and the 4, that's 8. So, 7 + 8 is 15.

The answer is 15!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I've seen these symbols before, but I'm not really sure what they mean or what I'm supposed to do with them. Let me think...

Oh, I remember! We did something like this in class a few days ago. I think we were supposed to follow some rules or something. Okay, so the first thing I need to do is multiply the 7 and the 2, right? So that's 14.

Next, I need to multiply the 8 and the 5. That's 40.

Now, I need to add the two numbers together. So, 14 + 40 = 54.

The answer is 54."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do this thing called ""order of operations"" when solving math problems. I think it's like a secret code that helps us figure out what to do first.

So, let's see... the problem is 4*3+2. I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, so I'll do that. 4 times 3 is... umm... 12!

Now, I'm supposed to do the addition next. So, 12 + 2 is... 14!

The answer is 14.

I hope that's right! I'm still a little confused about this order of operations thing, but I'll get the hang of it eventually."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Okay, let's try to solve this problem together!

First, we have 4 times something, and that something is 2 plus 5. So, we need to add 2 and 5 first.

2 + 5 = 7

Great! Now, we have 4 times 7, which is...

4 x 7 = 28

Next, we have 12. That's easy, we just add 12 to 28.

28 + 12 = 40

Finally, we have 2 times something. That something is 3. So, we need to multiply 2 and 3.

2 x 3 = 6

Now, we need to subtract 6 from 40.

40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...okay, I know I have to follow some rules to solve this problem. I think it's something like ""PEMDAS""...ugh, what does that even stand for? Oh well, I think it means I have to do the multiplication first, then the addition. So, I'll start by multiplying 3 and 2, which gives me 6. Then, I add 5 and 6, which gives me 11.

The answer is 11."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. I think it might be a way to do math problems, but I'm not sure. Can you help me?

Okay, let me try my best. I think I need to add 5 and 2 first, so that's 7. Then, I need to multiply 7 by 4, which is 28.

The answer is 28.

I hope that's right! I'm not sure if I did it correctly because I don't know much about math. Can you please help me learn more about PEMDAS?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Hi there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

First, I'll multiply 7 and 2, which gives me 14.

Then, I'll multiply 8 and 5, which gives me 40.

Next, I'll add 14 and 40, which gives me 54.

So, the answer is 54.

I hope that's correct! Can you tell me if I did it right?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?

Okay, I think I know how to do it now. First, I think we should do the multiplication because it's at the beginning of the problem. So, 4 times 3 is 12.

Next, we have the addition part. We need to add 2 to 12, so 12 + 2 is 14.

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. I think it's something about following a certain order when you do math problems, but I'm not sure what that order is. Can you help me?

Okay, let's see... 4 times 2 is 8, plus 5 is 13, plus 12 is 25, minus 2 times 3 is 25 - 6, which is 19.

The answer is 19."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, but I don't know why. It just seems like the right thing to do. So, I'll do the multiplication and get 6. Then, I'll add 5 and 6, which gives me 11. The answer is 11.

But wait, my teacher said something about parentheses being important. I think that means I should do the multiplication inside the parentheses first. So, I'll do 3*2 inside the parentheses and get 6. Then, I'll add 5 and 6, which gives me 11. The answer is still 11.

I hope that's right! I'm not really sure what I'm doing, but it seems to work. Can someone please explain to me why we do the multiplication first?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Okay, so we have this problem: 5+2*4. I'm not sure what PEMDAS means, but I think it's important to follow some rules to get the right answer.

First, I'll add 5 and 2. That's easy! 5 + 2 = 7.

Next, I'll multiply 2 by 4. That's also easy! 2 x 4 = 8.

Now, I'm not sure what to do. I think I'm supposed to add 7 and 8, but I'm not sure if I should do that before or after I multiply 7 by 8. I'm confused!

Oh wait, I remember something my teacher said! She said that when we have multiplication and addition in a problem, we should do the multiplication first and then do the addition.

So, I'll multiply 7 by 8 first. That's a little harder, but I can do it! 7 x 8 = 56.

Now, I'll add 56 and 5. That's easy! 56 + 5 = 61.

The answer is 61!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know I have to follow some rules to solve this problem, but I'm not sure what they are. I think I have to do the multiplication first? So, I'll start by multiplying 7 and 2, that's 14. Then, I have to multiply 8 and 5, that's 40.

Next, I have to add 14 and 40, that's 54.

The answer is 54.

I hope that's right!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I think I can help you with that problem!

First, let's start with the multiplication part, which is 4 times 3. That's easy, it's 12!

Next, we have the addition part, which is 2. We add 2 to 12, and that gives us... 14!

So, the answer is 14!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Hey, I'm just a kid in elementary school, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem!

Okay, so the first thing I see is the big number 4. It looks like it wants to be multiplied by something. Let's see... oh, there's a parentheses! That means we gotta do what's inside the parentheses first.

Inside the parentheses, there's a 2 and a 5. We need to add those together. Hmm... 2 + 5 equals... (thinking) 7!

Now, we can multiply 4 by 7. That's easy! 4 x 7 = 28.

But wait, there's more! There's a plus sign and a 12. We need to add 12 to 28. That's easy too! 28 + 12 = 40.

Oh no, there's a minus sign and a 2! We need to subtract 2 from 40. That's okay, I can do that! 40 - 2 = 38.

Phew, that was a lot of work! But I did it! The answer is 38. ðŸ˜ƒ"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Okay, so I see this Math question, and I'm like, ""Wait, what's PEMDAS again?"" And my teacher's like, ""It's the order of operations, duh!"" And I'm like, ""Oh yeah, I remember now!""

So, I look at the problem, and I see that there's a bunch of stuff happening. There's a 5, a 3, and a 2, and they're all doing different things. Like, the 5 is just chillin' there, not doing much. The 3 is multiplying the 2, which is cool, I guess. But, like, what do I do first?

I'm like, ""Okay, let me think about this."" And I start by doing the multiplication first. So, 3 times 2 is 6, because, you know, 3 groups of 2 is 6. That's easy!

Then, I'm like, ""Okay, what's next?"" And I see that there's this 5 just sitting there, looking at me. And I'm like, ""Oh, I know! I add the 5 to the 6!"" So, 6 + 5 is 11.

And that's it! The answer is 11.

I mean, it's not that hard, right? I just did what made sense. I did the multiplication first, and then I added the 5. It's like, basic Math, you know? But, like, I guess it's important to know the order of operations and stuff. Maybe next time I'll remember to do it in the right order. Maybe.

The answer is 11."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Okay! So, I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, but I don't know why. It just says to do it that way. So, I'll do the multiplication first.

2 times 4 is 8.

Now, I have 5 plus 8, which is 13.

The answer is 13!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Okay, let's see...

First, I know that when we have multiplication, we have to do it before we do addition. That's just how it works! So, I'll start by multiplying 7 and 2. That gives me 14.

Next, I'll multiply 8 and 5. That gives me 40.

Now, I have 14 and 40. I need to add them together. When I do, I get 54.

The answer is 54!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do multiplication before addition, but I don't know why. Let's see... 4 times 3 is 12, and then we add 2, so that's 14. The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what the order of operations is. Can you tell me what the order of operations is?

Okay, I was told that the order of operations is:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents (none in this problem)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

So, let me try to solve it now:

4*(2+5) = 4*7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2*3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, but I don't know why. I just know that's what my teacher says. So, I'll do the multiplication first.

3*2 = 6

Now, I add 5 to 6 and get...

6 + 5 = 11

The answer is 11."
