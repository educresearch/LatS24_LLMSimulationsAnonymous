But I can guess that we might need to follow some rules to make sure we get the right answer. Let's try to do the calculation step by step:

First, I see a multiplication sign (2*4), so I think we should do that one first. It's like when you multiply two numbers together to get a new number before adding anything else:

8 (When I multiply 2 and 4)

Now, I see an addition sign (5 +), so I think we should do that next. Adding numbers is easy to understand:

13 (When I add 5 and the result of 2*4)

I can only do simple addition and multiplication. Let's start with the multiplication since it comes before addition in a regular mathematical expression. That means, I should do 8 times 5 first.

So, I'll do that: 8 x 5 = 40

Next, there's 7 multiplied by 2. I'll do that, too: 7 x 2 = 14

Now I have 14 and 40, and I'm supposed to add them together. So, I'll do that: 14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54."

4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I'll do the multiplication:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3
