In this case, even though I did the addition and multiplication from left to right at first, I should have done the multiplication before the addition because it comes earlier in the order of operations.

Then, I would add 2 to 12, which gives me 14. So, the answer is 14.

The answer is 14."

First, I'll do the addition in the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.

So, the equation becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Now, I'll do the multiplication: 4 * 7 equals 28 and 2 * 3 equals 6.

So, the equation becomes: 28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 equals 40, and then 40 - 6 equals 34.

The answer is 34."

5 + 3 * 2

First, I will do 3 * 2:

5 + 6

Then, I will do the addition:

11
