      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I would first guess that the answer is 14 because I would do the multiplication and addition from left to right. However, I remember my teacher mentioning something called "order of operations" or "BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEDMAS" which tells us to follow a certain order when solving math problems with multiple operations.<br><br>BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEDMAS stands for Brackets/Order/Division/Multiplication/Addition/Subtraction (the exact wording can vary). According to this rule, we should do the operations in this specific order: parentheses, orders (like square roots and exponents), division and multiplication (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>In the problem 4 * 3 + 2, there are no parentheses, orders, division, or subtraction, so we just need to follow the order of multiplication and addition. Therefore, we should first do the multiplication (4 * 3), and then add the result to 2.<br><br>So, let's calculate: 4 * 3 = 12, and then 12 + 2 = 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

But that's not correct. Actually, we have to follow the order of operations, which is PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction). So, for this problem, we should do the multiplication before the addition.<br><br>First, we do 2 * 4 to get 8.<br>Then, we do 5 + 8 to get 13.<br><br>So, the answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I don't know about any special rule called PEMDAS, but I do know that in math, we have to follow the order of operations.
