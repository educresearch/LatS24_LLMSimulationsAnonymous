      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations rules in mathematics, which is sometimes referred to as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction). However, I can try to solve the problem using common sense. Here's my attempt:<br><br>First, I see there are no parentheses, exponents, or multiplication signs next to each other, so I'll do the multiplication:<br>4 times what? I see 2 and 5, so I add those numbers first: 2 + 5 = 7. Now I have 4 times 7, which equals 28.<br><br>Next, I see addition: I have 28 and 12, so I add those numbers: 28 + 12 = 40.<br><br>I also see a subtraction sign, -2*3. But I can't do subtraction or multiplication (or division) until I've finished all the addition and addition-like problems. So I'll leave that part for now.<br><br>The answer I have so far is 40. But remember, I couldn't do the subtraction part of the problem.<br><br>The answer is 40. (but it might be wrong since I couldn't finish the problem)</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just a 6th grade student and we haven't learned about the order of operations yet. But I can try to solve this problem step by step, just the way my teacher taught me. Let's see:<br><br>1. The first step is to do the operation inside the parentheses, so I'll calculate 2 + 5, which equals 7.<br>2. Then, I'll perform the multiplication, so I'll calculate 4 * 7, which equals 28.<br>3. Now, I have 28 and need to add 12, so I'll calculate 28 + 12, which equals 40.<br>4. Finally, I need to subtract 2 * 3 from the answer, but since I haven't learned about the order of operations, I can't remember if I should do the multiplication first or last. So, without knowing the rules, I'll just leave it as -2 * 3 = -6. I don't know how to subtract that from 40 yet.<br><br>So, the solution I came up with based on simple addition, subtraction, and multiplication without knowing the order of operations is: The answer is 40 - 6 = 34. But this might not be the correct answer since I don't know about the order of operations yet!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I am not yet familiar with the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction).

      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I've never heard of PEMDAS or order of operations in mathematics before. When I see a problem like this, I just follow the common sense rule: do multiplication first, then addition or subtraction, and finally do any exponents.<br><br>So, for the problem 4*3+2, I would do the multiplication first:<br><br>12 (4*3)<br><br>Then I would do the addition:<br><br>14 (12+2)<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm a sixth grader and I've never heard of this thing called PEMDAS for ordering math operations. Let's just do this problem one step at a time, shall we?<br><br>First, I see the multiplication sign, 4 times 3. That means I do this part first:<br><br>12 (4*3=12)<br><br>Next, I have the addition sign, 12 plus 2:<br><br>14 (12+2=14)<br><br>So, that's it! The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I don't really know about order of operations in mathematics yet. But, let me try to solve the problem based on what I see: First, I see the multiplication sign (4 times 3), then I see the addition sign (4 times 3 plus 2). So, I think I should do the multiplication first, then the addition. That's what I'll do, and hope I'm on the right track!<br><br>The answer is: 12 (12 is the result of 4*3).<br><br>Next, I'll use the result (12) I just got and add 2 to it:<br><br>12 + 2<br><br>The final answer is: 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I've got this problem here: 4 multiplied by 3, and then add 2. I normally do things from left to right when I read, but for this math problem, I've heard there's a special rule called "PEMDAS" or "BODMAS" or something like that. I'm not quite sure what it means though.<br><br>But I'll try to apply it to my problem:<br><br>1. Multiplication: 4*3 = 12<br>2. Addition: 12 + 2 = 14<br><br>So, The answer is 14.<br><br>But honestly, I wish I could just read and do math problems from left to right normally. Maybe someday I'll understand this strange rule.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just a grade 6 student and we haven't learned about the order of operations yet.

      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations in mathematics. But I can try to solve this problem based on what seems logical to me. From my understanding, we usually do addition and subtraction before we do multiplication and division. So here's how I would approach this problem:<br><br>1. Multiply 3 and 2, because this is a multiplication operation. So the first part of the equation becomes 3*2 = 6.<br>2. Now, we have 5 + 6.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just a grade 6 student and we haven't learned about those weird letters (PEMDAS) yet.

      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, I see numbers and a symbol "*" for multiplication. I'm not sure what to do first. Let me try this: This 3, it looks like it's next to the multiplication symbol, so maybe I should do that first? So, let me do 3 times 2: That gives me 6.

      <td>GPT Response: Alright, so I have this problem here: 7 times 2, and then add 8 times 5. I'm not sure which one I should do first, but I think I need to follow some rules. Let's call them Rule 1 and Rule 2.<br><br>Rule 1: If you have an operation inside parentheses, do that first.<br>Rule 2: (From what I remember, but I'm not totally sure) When you have multiple operations that aren't inside parentheses, you do the ones with numbers and exponents first, and then the multiplication and division, and lastly, addition and subtraction.<br><br>Well, there are no parentheses in this problem, so let's see if I can use Rule 2. According to Rule 2, I should first do the multiplications since there are no exponents in this problem. So, I do 7 times 2 and 8 times 5:<br><br>7 * 2 = 14<br>8 * 5 = 40<br><br>Now, according to Rule 2, the last step is to do addition and subtraction.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I don't really understand this thing called order of operations yet. But I see there are some numbers, and some symbols for multiplication (*) and addition (+).
