mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Well, I don't know about any special rule called PEMDAS, but I do know that in math, we have to follow the order of operations. First, we do any operations inside parentheses, then we do any multiplication or division (from left to right), and finally we do any addition or subtraction (from left to right).

In this problem, there are no parentheses, so I'll start with the multiplication. I see that we have to multiply 7 by 2 and 8 by 5. 

So, 7 times 2 equals 14, and 8 times 5 equals 40. Now I have a new problem: 14 plus 40.

Finally, I add those two numbers together. 14 plus 40 equals 54.

The answer is 54."

First, I will do the operations inside the parentheses, which are addition and subtraction:

4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I see multiplication and addition, so I'll do the multiplication first:

28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, I'll do addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: If I was given the math problem 5 + 2 * 4 and I don't know about the order of operations, I would probably solve it from left to right and get 24 as the answer. But that's not correct. Actually, we have to follow the order of operations, which is PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction). So, for this problem, we should do the multiplication before the addition.

First, we do 2 * 4 to get 8.
Then, we do 5 + 8 to get 13.

So, the answer is 13."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: I would start by remembering that my teacher told me about something called order of operations, which helps me figure out the right order to do the math steps. I think it's written as PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

For my question, 7 * 2 + 8 * 5, I see multiplication and addition signs, but no parentheses or exponents. So I should follow the next steps in order: Multiplication and Division. I'll do the multiplication parts first, which are 7 * 2 and 8 * 5, and get 14 and 40.

Now I have 14 + 40, which is addition, so I do this last step and get 54.

The answer is 54."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: I would start by multiplying 4 and 3 to get 12. Then I would add 2 to 12 to get 14. So the answer is 14.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: I don't know about any order of operations, but I can still try to solve this problem by doing the operations from left to right. 

First, I see a multiplication (4 × (2+5)), so I'll do that part first: 4 × 7 = 28.

Now, my problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2 × 3.

I see another multiplication (2 × 3), so I'll do that next: 2 × 3 = 6.

Now, my problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.

I see additions and subtraction from left to right, so I'll do the addition first: 28 + 12 = 40.

Lastly, I do the subtraction: 40 - 6 = 34.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Well, I don't know much about order of operations, but I know that in elementary school, we usually do calculations from left to right. So let's calculate it step by step.

First, multiply 7 and 2: that gives 14.
Then add 8 to the result: that gives 22.
Next, multiply 8 and 5: that gives 40.
Finally, add this result to the previous one: that gives 62.

So, the answer is 62."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I would first guess that the answer is 14 because I would do the multiplication and addition from left to right. However, I remember my teacher mentioning something called ""order of operations"" or ""BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEDMAS"" which tells us to follow a certain order when solving math problems with multiple operations.

BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEDMAS stands for Brackets/Order/Division/Multiplication/Addition/Subtraction (the exact wording can vary). According to this rule, we should do the operations in this specific order: parentheses, orders (like square roots and exponents), division and multiplication (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).

In the problem 4 * 3 + 2, there are no parentheses, orders, division, or subtraction, so we just need to follow the order of multiplication and addition. Therefore, we should first do the multiplication (4 * 3), and then add the result to 2.

So, let's calculate: 4 * 3 = 12, and then 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: If I don't know about order of operations, I would solve this problem step by step, based on how the numbers and operations are written. I would do addition and subtraction before multiplication and division, because those come first when I read from left to right.

First, I'll do the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.
Then, I'll multiply 4 by 7: 4 * 7 = 28.
Now, I'll add 12 to the result: 28 + 12 = 40.
Next, I'll multiply 2 by 3: 2 * 3 = 6.
Finally, I'll subtract 6 from 40: 40 - 6 = 34.
