mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Okay, so if I don't know about the order of operations, I would just solve this problem from left to right. This is called ""straightline"" or ""left-to-right"" method.

First, I would do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.

So the equation becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I would do the multiplication: 4 * 7 equals 28 and 2 * 3 equals 6.

So the equation becomes: 28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, I would do addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 equals 40, and then 40 - 6 equals 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: Hello, I'm a grade 6 student who doesn't know about order of operations (PEMDAS). When I see a math problem like this: 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3, I don't know where to start. But, I think we can do the operations inside the parentheses first, since it seems like the first step that adults usually take.

4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3

Now, I see some more parentheses, so I'll do those operations again:

28 + 12 - 6

Finally, I can do addition and subtraction from left to right. I learned that in grade 1!

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: I would start by doing the operations in the parentheses first, so I would add 2 + 5 to get 7. Then I would have:

4 \* 7 + 12 - 2 \* 3

Next, I would do the multiplication, so I would multiply 4 \* 7 to get 28 and 2 \* 3 to get 6. Then I would have:

28 + 12 - 6

Finally, I would do the addition and subtraction from left to right, so I would add 28 + 12 to get 40, and then subtract 6 from 40 to get 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will follow the steps my teacher taught me, even though I don't know the fancy name ""order of operations"" yet. I will do the operations inside the parentheses first, then multiply and divide from left to right, and finally add and subtract from left to right.

First, I will do the addition inside the first parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7. Now the equation looks like this: 

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I will do the multiplication and division from left to right: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6. Now the equation looks like this:

28 + 12 - 6

Finally, I will do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40 and 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34."

So I would first multiply 4 and 3, which gives me 12.

Then, I would add the result to 2. So I would add 12 and 2, which gives me 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will just solve this by doing the operations from left to right.

First, I will multiply 4 and 3 which equals 12.
Then, I will add 2 to the result of the multiplication which equals 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: If I was given the math problem 4 x 3 + 2 without knowing about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would still solve it correctly because it's a pretty simple problem. I would first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12, and then add 2 to get 14.

So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I would first add and then multiply to solve this problem. I would add 4 and 3 to get 7, and then multiply that result by 2.

Doing this, I would get 7 * 4, which is 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: As a 6th grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think about doing the addition and multiplication at the same time because there are no numbers in parentheses or exponents. But since I don't know the rules yet, I might get the wrong answer.

So, I will add 5 and 2 to get 7, and then multiply that result by 4.

7 multiplied by 4 equals 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: I don't know about any order of operations, so I will just solve this from left to right. First, I will do the addition:

5 + 2 = 7

Now I will multiply that result by 4:

7 * 4 = 28

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about order of operations, I would first think of doing the addition and then the multiplication. But I remember my teacher telling me that there's a special rule for this, called BIDMAS or PEMDAS, which stands for Brackets/parentheses, Indices/Exponents, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So for the expression 5 + 2*4, I should do the multiplication first because it comes before addition in BIDMAS/PEMDAS.

First, I calculate 2*4 to get 8.
Then, I do the addition: 5 + 8 to get 13.

The answer is 13."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the addition part of the problem since that's what I see first. But I remember my teacher telling me that there's a rule for this, and we should always follow the order of operations to get the right answer.

The order of operations is: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.

In this problem, I don't see any parentheses or exponents. But I do see multiplication and addition. According to the order of operations, I should do the multiplication first, then the addition.

So, I'll calculate 3*2 first, which is 6.

Then I'll add that result to 5: 5 + 6.

Then, I would multiply the result 8 by 2 to get 16.

Therefore, the answer is 16.","GPT Response: I would add five and three first because when there are numbers and operation signs together, I should do the operations from left to right. So it would be 5 + 3 = 8 and then multiply the result by two: 8 * 2 = 16.

So, I would first multiply 7 by 2 and get 14, then add 8 and get 22, and finally multiply 8 by 5 and get 40. But then I realize that maybe I should have done the multiplication before the addition. I'm not sure, but I think I made a mistake.

However, if I were to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would do the multiplications first, and then the addition. So, I would first multiply 7 by 2 and get 14, then multiply 8 by 5 and get 40, and finally add 14 and 40 to get 54.
