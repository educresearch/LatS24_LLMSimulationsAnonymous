      <td>GPT Response: Hi, I'm a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS). To solve this problem, I'll just do the operations from left to right.<br><br>First, I'll do the multiplication: 4 \* 2 = 8.<br>Now the expression is: 8 + (5) + 12 - 2 \* 3.<br><br>Next, I'll do addition: 8 + 5 = 13.<br>Now the expression is: 13 + 12 - 2 \* 3.<br><br>Then, I'll do subtraction: 13 + 12 = 25, and 25 - 2 = 23.<br>Now the expression is: 23 - 2 \* 3.<br><br>Again, I'll do multiplication: 2 \* 3 = 6.<br>Now the expression is: 23 - 6.<br><br>Finally, I'll do the remaining subtraction: 23 - 6 = 17.<br><br>The answer is 17.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I don't know about order of operations, but I know how to do things one step at a time. So, I would first solve the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.<br><br>Then, I would multiply 4 by 7, which gives me 28.<br><br>Next, I would add 12 to 28, which gives me 40.<br><br>Finally, I would multiply 2 by 3, which gives me 6, and then subtract that from 40.<br><br>So, the answer is 40 - 6, which is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh boy, I don't know much about math but I can sure try to answer this! So, I see some numbers and some operations here. I think I should do the operations in parentheses first, that seems to make sense.<br><br>First, let me add 2 and 5 together inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.<br><br>Now, the expression looks like this: 4 \* 7 + 12 - 2 \* 3<br><br>Next, I see there are still some operations in parentheses, but they're multiplication this time. I remember my teacher saying something about doing multiplication and division before addition and subtraction, so I'll do those next.<br><br>4 \* 7 equals 28, and 2 \* 3 equals 6, so the expression is now like this: 28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Finally, I suppose I should do addition and subtraction from left to right. So I'll add 28 and 12 together: 28 + 12 equals 40.<br><br>Now, I subtract 6 from 40: 40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: I would first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12, then add 2 to 12.

However, I recently learned that there's something called "order of operations" that says you should do certain operations before others. According to order of operations, you should do multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. So, I should first multiply 3 and 2 to get 6, and then add that result to 5.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I don't know about any special rules like "PEMDAS", but I know that in math, we have to do the multiplication and division before addition and subtraction.

      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, this problem has numbers and symbols. My teacher said we should do the problem from left to right, but I heard some older kids talking about something called PEMDAS. I think it's an order to follow so we do the right operations first.<br><br>Looking at PEMDAS, I see that multiplication is included, so I'll do the 7 times 2 first, that equals 14. The problem becomes 14 + 8 times 5.<br><br>Now I should do 8 times 5, which gives me 40. The problem is now 14 + 40.<br><br>Finally, I add these two numbers, resulting in 54.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, as a student in elementary school, I would first try to solve the multiplication and addition parts one by one. But I remember my teacher saying something about a special rule called "order of operations" that helps us know which operation to do first. It goes like this: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). <br><br>So for the problem 7 * 2 + 8 * 5, even though I see multiplication and addition, I should do the multiplications first according to this rule. <br><br>First, I'll multiply 7 and 2 which gives me 14. <br>Then, I'll multiply 8 and 5 which gives me 40.<br>Then, I add these two results together because there's an addition sign after those multiplications in the original problem.<br><br>So, 14 + 40 equals 54. <br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
