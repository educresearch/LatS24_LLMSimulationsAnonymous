      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm just a grade 6 student, and I'm not sure what this "PEMDAS" thing is all about. But I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is the multiplication symbol, which means I have to multiply 4 and 2+5. That's easy, it's just 4 times 7, which is 28.<br><br>Next, I see a plus sign, and that means I have to add 12 to 28. That's easy too, it's just 40.<br><br>But wait, there's a minus sign too! That means I have to subtract something from 40. I see 2 times 3, which is 6. So, I have to subtract 6 from 40. That's easy, it's just 34.<br><br>So, the answer is 34!<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 and the parentheses, so I'll start by multiplying 4 by what's inside the parentheses. That gives me 4*7 = 28.<br><br>Next, I see the 12, so I'll add that to 28 and get 40.<br><br>Finally, I see the -2*3, so I'll subtract 6 from 40 and get 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.<br><br>I hope that's correct! Can someone please tell me what this PEMDAS thing is and why it's important?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, first I would start by adding 2 and 5 together because that's what you do first when you have numbers next to each other. So, that's 7.<br><br>Then, I would multiply 4 by 7 because that's what the problem says to do next. That's 28.<br><br>Next, I would add 12 to 28 because the problem says to do that next. That's 40.<br><br>Last, I would subtract 2 times 3 from 40 because that's what the problem says to do last. That's 37.<br><br>The answer is 37.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, let me try to solve this problem!<br><br>First, I see some numbers that are being added together inside parentheses, so I think I need to do that first.<br><br>2+5 = 7<br><br>Great! Now I have my first answer. But wait, there's more!<br><br>Next, I see a multiplication sign. I know I need to do this part next.<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br><br>Oh, there's more still! I see another addition sign. I'll do this next.<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>Finally, I see a subtraction sign. I'll do this last.<br><br>40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34<br><br>The answer is 34!</td>

Can you tell me if I did it correctly?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so we have a big number, 4, and it's multiplying another number, 3! That's gonna give us... *thinks*... 12! Because 4 times 3 is 12. And then, we have this little number 2 just chillin' there. It's not doing anything fancy like multiplication, it's just adding. So we'll add 2 to 12 and get... *thinks*... 14! The answer is 14!</td>

I think it's like a secret code or something!<br><br>Okay, so the problem is 4*3+2. I know what the multiplication symbol means, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 3.

      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm trying to solve this math problem, and I'm not really sure how to do it. I know I'm supposed to follow some rules, but I don't know what they are. I think it's something like "PEMDAS" but I'm not sure what that means. Can you help me out?<br><br>Okay, so the problem is 5+2*4. I think I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, so that's what I'll do. 2*4 is equal to 8, right? So, now I have 5+8. Next, I think I'm supposed to add 5 and 8, so that's what I'll do. 5+8 is equal to 13!<br><br>The answer is 13.<br><br>I hope that's right! Can you tell me if I did it correctly?</td>

That gives me 8.<br><br>Now, I have two answers: 7 and 8. I'm not sure which one is the final answer.<br><br>Oh, I know! I'll just add 7 and 8 together. That gives me 15.<br><br>So, the answer is 15.<br><br>The answer is 15.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know that when we do math, we have to follow some rules. One of those rules is that we have to do things in a special order. It's like following a recipe. First, we have to do the things that are inside the parentheses, then we have to do the things that are outside the parentheses.<br><br>In this problem, we have 5 + 2 * 4. The * means "times," so we have to do 2 times 4 first. That's easy! 2 times 4 is 8.<br><br>Now, we have 5 + 8. We have to add 5 and 8 together, so we get 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
