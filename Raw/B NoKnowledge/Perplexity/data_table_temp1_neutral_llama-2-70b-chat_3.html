      <td>GPT Response: Hey, I'm just a grade 6 student, and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll try my best to solve this math problem!<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 multiplied by something. That's easy, I know how to do that! It's 4 times 2 plus 5, right? That's 4 times 7, which is 28.<br><br>Next, there's a plus sign, and then a 12. Hmm, I'm not sure what to do with that. Do I add 12 to 28? That doesn't seem right. Oh wait, I remember my teacher saying something about parentheses! I think I need to do whatever is inside the parentheses first.<br><br>So, I see a 2 inside the parentheses, and then a plus sign, and then a 5. Hmm, that looks like addition to me! I know how to add! So, I'll add 2 and 5, and that's 7.<br><br>Now, there's a minus sign, and then a 2 times 3. Wait, I know how to do that too! That's just like multiplying, right? So, 2 times 3 is 6.<br><br>Okay, so now I have 28 plus 7 minus 6. That's easy! It's 29!<br><br>The answer is 29.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll try my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>Okay, so I see a bunch of numbers and symbols here. Let's start with the multiplication. I know that 4 times 2 is 8, and 4 times 5 is 20. So, 4*(2+5) is 8 + 20 = 28.<br><br>Next, I see a plus sign followed by 12. That means I need to add 12 to 28, so that's 40.<br><br>Finally, there's a minus sign followed by 2 times 3. That means I need to subtract 6 from 40, which gives me 34.<br><br>So, the answer is 34!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. I know that PEMDAS is important in math, but I don't understand what it stands for or why it matters. Can you explain it to me?<br><br>Okay, I think I understand a little bit now. So, PEMDAS stands for "Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction." That means we have to follow a certain order when we're doing math problems, right? Like, we have to do the things inside parentheses first, then exponents, then multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction.<br><br>So, let's try to solve the problem again. First, we need to do the things inside parentheses. There's a 2 and a 5 inside parentheses, so we need to add them together. That's 7. Then, we have to do the exponents. There's a 4 outside the parentheses, so we need to raise it to the power of 2. That's 16. Next, we have to do the multiplication and division. There's a 12 and a 3, so we need to multiply 12 by 3, which is 36. Finally, we have to do the addition and subtraction. We have to add 36 and 7, which is 43.<br><br>The answer is 43.<br><br>I hope that's right! I'm still a little confused about PEMDAS, but I think I'm starting to understand it a little better. Can you give me some more problems to practice with?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, let's see...<br><br>First, we need to do the addition inside the parentheses. That's 2+5, which is 7.<br><br>Next, we multiply 4 by 7, and that's 28.<br><br>Then, we add 12 to 28, and that's 40.<br><br>Finally, we subtract 2 times 3, which is 6.<br><br>So, the final answer is 40 - 6, which is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...<br><br>Okay, I know that when we multiply numbers, we do it from left to right. So, first, I'll do 4*3, which is 12.<br><br>Then, there's a plus sign, so I'll add 2 to 12, which is 14.<br><br>So, the answer is 14!<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do multiplication before addition, but I don't know why. It just sounds like a rule that my teacher made up!<br><br>So, I'm gonna do the multiplication part first. 4 times 3 is... um... *counts on fingers*... 12!<br><br>Now, I have to add 2 to that. *adds 2 to 12*<br><br>The answer is 14!</td>
