      <td>GPT Response: Okay, I'll give it a try!<br><br>First, I see some parentheses, so I need to do what's inside them first. Inside the parentheses is 2+5, so I add 2 and 5 and get 7.<br><br>Now, I go outside the parentheses and see 4 times 7, which is 28.<br><br>Next, I see 12. I don't know what to do with it yet, so I'll just leave it alone for now.<br><br>After that, I see minus 2 times 3, which is minus 6.<br><br>Finally, I add 28 and 12, which is 40. Then, I add 40 and minus 6, which is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hi there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>Okay, so I see a bunch of numbers and symbols here. Let's start with the multiplication. I know that 4 * 2 is 8, and 4 * 5 is 20. Add those together and I get 28.<br><br>Next, I see a plus sign and a minus sign. I'm not sure what to do with those, but I think I should add 12 to 28, so that's 40.<br><br>Finally, I see a multiplication symbol and a 3. I know that 2 * 3 is 6, so I'll add that to 40 and get 46.<br><br>The answer is 46.<br><br>I hope that's right!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, let me think about this...<br><br>First, we have a bunch of numbers and operations all mixed together. I know we need to follow some kind of order to make sense of it all.<br><br>I see a multiplication symbol first, so I think that's where we should start. It says 4 times something. The something is 2 plus 5, so we need to add those numbers together first. That's easy, 2 + 5 = 7.<br><br>Now, we go back to the original problem and put the 7 where the 2 and 5 were. So, it looks like this: 4 * 7. Now, we multiply 4 and 7, and that gives us 28.<br><br>But wait, there's more! We have another operation, a subtraction symbol. It says 28 minus 2 times 3. That's simple, 2 times 3 is 6, so we subtract 6 from 28. That gives us 22.<br><br>The answer is 22.<br><br>I hope that's right! Did I do it correctly?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem, but I'll try my best!<br><br>First, I see a multiplication sign, so I'll do that part first. 4 * 2+5 is 4 * 7, which is 28.<br><br>Next, I see a plus sign, so I'll add 12 to 28, which is 40.<br><br>Finally, I see a minus sign and a multiplication sign. I'm not sure what to do here, but I think I need to multiply 3 by 2 and then subtract it from 40. So, 2 * 3 is 6, and 40 - 6 is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...<br><br>Okay, I know I have to follow some rules to solve this problem.

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to follow some rules when doing math problems, but I don't really know what they are. I think I'm just supposed to do whatever makes sense in my head? Like, if someone asks me to find 5 + 2, I just add 5 and 2 in my head and get 7. But then, if they ask me to find 2 times 4, I just multiply 2 and 4 in my head and get 8. So, for this problem, 5 + 2 * 4, I'm gonna do what makes sense in my head and just multiply 2 and 4 first, because that's what I think I'm supposed to do. So, 2 times 4 is 8. Then, I add 5 and 8 and get 13. The answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think... okay, I know we have to follow some rules when we do math problems, but I don't know what they are called. I think we are supposed to do things in a special order, like first do the multiplication, then the addition? Or is it the other way around? Okay, I'll try my best!<br><br>So, first I'll do the multiplication: 7 * 2 = 14. Now, what's next? Oh yeah, the addition! 14 + 8 * 5... hmm, that's a lot of numbers! 14 + 40... carry the 1... 54!<br><br>The answer is 54.<br><br>(And that's how a grade 6 student who knows nothing about order of operations might answer the question, hopefully! :D)</td>
