So I would add 5 and 2 to get 7, then multiply that result by 4.

7 * 4 = 28

The answer is 28."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first answer this question based on the order I see the operations. 

So I would do:

7 times 2 equals 14,
and
8 times 5 equals 40.

Then I would add those results:

14 plus 40 equals 54.

So the answer is:

The answer is 54."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Sure! As a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first remember that in elementary school, we usually do addition and subtraction before multiplication and division. So, I would first add 4 and 3 to get 7, then multiply that result by 2.

The answer is 14."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Sure! As a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about order of operations (PEMDAS), I would solve this problem step by step, following the order in which the operations appear.
First, I would do the operations inside the parentheses:
4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28
And
2 * 3 = 6
Then, I would do addition and subtraction from left to right, so:
28 + 12 - 6 = 40 - 6 = 34
So, the answer is 34."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: I would first multiply 3 and 2 to get 6. Then I would add the result to 5. This is because when there are no parentheses or exponents, I should do multiplication and division before addition and subtraction.

The answer is 11."

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Well, I'm a grade 6 student who doesn't know about order of operations yet. So, I would just solve this problem step by step, according to how I was taught.

First, I'd do the operations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.

Then, I'd multiply 4 by 7, since there are no other operations with a higher precedence, giving me 28.

Next, I'd add 12 to 28, resulting in 40.

After that, I'd multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6.

Finally, I'd subtract 6 from 40, which leaves me with 34.

The answer is 34."

So, I would first add 5 and 3 to get 8.
Then, I would multiply the result (which is 8) by 2.

When I do the calculation, I get 16.

Therefore, the answer is 16."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: I don't know about any special rules for doing math, so I will just do the operations from left to right. First, I will add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then, I will multiply that result by 4 to get 28.

The answer is 28."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: If I were given the math problem 7 x 2 + 8 x 5 and I didn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would still solve it step by step. I would first multiply 7 and 2 to get 14, and then multiply 8 and 5 to get 40. Then, I would add the two results together to get 54. So, the answer is 54. But, since I now know about the order of operations, I would perform the multiplication before the addition. This would mean multiplying 7 x 2 and 8 x 5 first and then adding them together. This would also give me the same answer of 54, but it is important to follow the correct order of operations to ensure accurate results.

The answer is 54."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: I would first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12, then add 2 to get 14. I know this because I learned that when there's both multiplication and addition in a problem, you should do the multiplication before the addition.

The answer is 14."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: If I was given the mathematics problem ""4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3"" and I didn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would probably solve it from left to right. However, this can lead to incorrect results, as the order of operations is a rule that ensures consistent and proper calculation.

Using the order of operations, we first perform the operation inside the parentheses, then any exponents, followed by multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally addition and subtraction (from left to right).

So, for this problem, we would first solve (2+5) to get 7, then do the multiplication, then the addition, and finally the subtraction.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Calculate the expression in the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7
2. Multiply: 4 * 7 = 28
3. Add: 28 + 12 = 40
4. Multiply: 2 * 3 = 6
5. Subtract: 40 - 6 = 34

Therefore, the answer is 34."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: I don't know about any order of operations rule, but I know that I can do the multiplication first because it's easier and faster for me. So I would calculate 3 times 2 to get 6. Then I would add 5 to get 11.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Well, I don't know much about this stuff, but I can give it a try! So, there are these rules called BIDMAS or PEMDAS which tell you what to calculate first, second and so on. They stand for Brackets/parentheses, Indices/Exponents, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In our problem, there aren't any brackets or indices, so we look for multiplication and addition signs. Let's start from left to right:

1. Multiply 7 by 2, which gives us 14.
2. Then, move on to the next operation, which is multiplying 8 by 5, giving us 40.
3. Finally, add the two results together: 14 + 40.

The answer is 54."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about order of operations, I would first complete the multiplication and addition from left to right. So, I would first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then, I would add 2 to "
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Okay, I'm a student in elementary school and I don't know about the order of operations in Mathematics yet. So, let's solve this step by step.

First, I see numbers with parentheses, so I'll do the operation inside them first: 2 + 5 equals 7.

Now the equation looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, there are more parentheses, but they only have one number each, so I'll do those multiplications: 4 times 7 is 28, and 2 times 3 is 6.

The equation now looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

Now, I see addition and subtraction, and since there's no order for those, I'll do them from left to right: 28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 6 is 34.

The answer is 34."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations, I would first think of doing the addition and then the multiplication because that's what I learned so far. But I remember my teacher mentioning something about a special rule for this.

Oh right! I remember now, we have to follow the order of operations, which is: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). It's also known as PEMDAS.

In this problem, we don't have parentheses or exponents, so we look at multiplication and division next. We do those first, and then we do addition and subtraction.

First, I'll do the multiplication: 3 times 2 equals 6.

Then, I'll do the addition: 5 plus 6 equals 11.

The answer is 11."
