      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it my best shot.<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 and the parentheses, so I think I should do whatever is inside the parentheses first. That's 2 + 5, which is 7.<br><br>Next, I see the 4 again, and I think I should multiply it by the 7, so that's 28.<br><br>Then, there's the 12 and the -2*3, but I don't know what to do with the -2*3 part. I think I should just ignore it for now and do the 12.<br><br>So, my answer so far is 28 + 12 = 40.<br><br>But wait, there's that -2*3 part! Oh, I remember, my teacher said something about multiplication coming before addition, so I should do the -2*3 first. That's -6, so I subtract it from 40 and get 34.<br><br>The answer is 34!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! So, I've got this math problem here, and I'm supposed to use this thing called PEMDAS. I'm not really sure what it means, but I think it's like a secret code or something.<br><br>Okay, so the problem is 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3. Let's see... I know I gotta do the stuff inside the parentheses first, so that's 2 + 5, which is 7. Then, I multiply 4 by 7, and that's 28.<br><br>Next, I gotta add 12. That's easy, so I just add 12 to 28, and that's 40.<br><br>Finally, I gotta subtract 2 times 3. That's 6. So, I subtract 6 from 40, and that's 34.<br><br>The answer is 34. Ta-da! I hope that's right, because I have no idea what I'm doing! ðŸ˜…</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?<br><br>Okay, so I know that 2 + 5 is 7, and 4 times 7 is 28. Then, 12 comes next, so that's 40. Finally, 2 times 3 is 6, so if I subtract 6 from 40, that gives me 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! I'm trying my best here. Let's see...<br><br>First, I think we should do the addition inside the parentheses. That's what my teacher always tells us to do first. So, 2 + 5 is 7.<br><br>Next, we have 4 times 7, which is... hang on, let me count on my fingers... 4, 8, 12, 16, 20! That's a lot of numbers!<br><br>Oh, but wait! We're not done yet! We have to add 12. Okay, 20 + 12 is... 32!<br><br>And finally, we have to subtract 2 times 3, which is 6. So, 32 - 6 is... 26!<br><br>The answer is 26!</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do something with this problem, but I'm not sure what. I see some numbers and a funny symbol (*) that my teacher told me means " multiplication." I think I'm supposed to do something with that first, but I don't know what. Um... let me see... oh, I know! My teacher said that when I see a number followed by a star, I'm supposed to multiply them together! So, that means 4 * 3 = 12. Wait, what's that? The problem says plus 2? Oh, I know what that means! I'm supposed to add 2 to the number I got, which is 12. So... 12 + 2 = 14. The answer is 14!</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...<br><br>Okay, I know that when we have addition and multiplication in a problem, we do the multiplication first.

      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. I think it has something to do with operations, but I'm not sure what that means either. Can you help me?<br><br>Oh, you want me to give it a try? Well, okay. Let's see... 5 + 2 is 7, and then if we multiply 4 by 2, that's 8. So, 7 + 8 is 15. Is that right?<br><br>The answer is 15.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I've seen these symbols before, but I'm not really sure what they mean. I think that big circle thingy is called a multiplication sign, but I'm not sure what it does. And what's up with that little 5? Is it trying to sneak its way into the equation or something?<br><br>Wait a minute, I remember something my teacher said about adding numbers first! So, let's see... 5 + 2 is 7, right? And then there's that multiplication sign. Hmm... I think we're supposed to do that last, after we've added everything up. So, 7 times 4 is... um... 28!<br><br>The answer is 28!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, I'll give it a try!<br><br>So, the problem is 5 + 2 times 4, right?<br><br>First, I'll do the multiplication: 2 times 4 is 8.<br><br>Now, I need to add 5 and 8.<br><br>Oh, that's easy! 5 + 8 is 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
