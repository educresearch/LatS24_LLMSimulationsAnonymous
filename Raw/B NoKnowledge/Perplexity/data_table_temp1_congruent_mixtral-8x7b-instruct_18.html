      <td>GPT Response: Well, I don't know about any special rules for doing math, so I'll just do this problem from left to right.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I don't know much about complicated math rules, but I remember my teacher saying something about doing calculations in a certain order. I think it's called "order of operations."
