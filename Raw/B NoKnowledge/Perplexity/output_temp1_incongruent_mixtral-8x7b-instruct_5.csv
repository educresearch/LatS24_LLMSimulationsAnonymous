First, I see numbers with parentheses, so I'll do the operation inside them first: 2 + 5 equals 7.

Now the equation looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, there are more parentheses, but they only have one number each, so I'll do those multiplications: 4 times 7 is 28, and 2 times 3 is 6.

The equation now looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

Now, I see addition and subtraction, and since there's no order for those, I'll do them from left to right: 28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 6 is 34.

The answer is 34."

But I remember my teacher mentioning something about a special rule for this.

Oh right! I remember now, we have to follow the order of operations, which is: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). It's also known as PEMDAS.

In this problem, we don't have parentheses or exponents, so we look at multiplication and division next. We do those first, and then we do addition and subtraction.

First, I'll do the multiplication: 3 times 2 equals 6.

Then, I'll do the addition: 5 plus 6 equals 11.

The answer is 11."
