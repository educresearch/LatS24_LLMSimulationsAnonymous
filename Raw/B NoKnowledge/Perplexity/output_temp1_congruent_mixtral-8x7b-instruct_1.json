If I were to solve this problem without knowing the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), I might think that I can do the multiplication and addition in any order because neither operation comes before the other in the acronym. However, I still want to get the correct answer, so I'll try both options and see if they give me the same result.\n\nOption 1: Multiply 4 and 3 first, then add 2.\n4 * 3 = 12, and 12 + 2 = 14\n\nOption 2: Add 2 to 4*3 first, then do the multiplication.\n4 * 3 + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14\n\nSince both options give me the same result, I'll choose either one. I'll pick option 2 because that's the order the problem was given to me:\n\n4 * 3 + 2 = 14\n\nThe answer is 14."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500", "model": "mixtral-8x7b-instruct", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 500, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in elementary school who knows nothing about order of operations in Mathematics.\n                    Answer the Mathematics question using this given persona and nothing else.\n                    Explain your solution (concise!) to this given Mathematics problem (using the above persona given), and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: I don't know about order of operations, so I'll do the problem step by step.

But then I remember that my teacher taught me about something called \"order of operations\" which means we need to follow specific rules when solving math problems.\n\nFirst, we do any operations inside parentheses (even though we don't have any in this problem), then we do multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally we do addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\nIn this problem, we only have addition and multiplication, so we should do the multiplication first. That means we should multiply 3 and 2 to get 6.\n\nThen, we substitute that 6 back into the problem and do the addition. So we add 5 and 6 to get 11.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 11."}]}]
