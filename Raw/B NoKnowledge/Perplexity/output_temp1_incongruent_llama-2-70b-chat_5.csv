Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 multiplied by something. I don't know what that something is yet, but I'll come back to it.

Next, I see a bunch of numbers and operations that look like they're inside some parentheses. I think I'm supposed to do whatever is inside the parentheses first, so let's see...

There's a 2 and a 5, and they're added together. That's easy! 2 + 5 = 7.

Now, there's a 12. I don't know what to do with that yet, but I'll just leave it alone for now.

Oh, wait! I see a minus sign! That means I have to subtract something. There's a 2 and a 3, and they're multiplied together. That's easy too! 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, I have to subtract 6 from... hmm, what was that number again? Oh yeah, 12! So, 12 - 6 = 6.

Okay, I think that's everything! Let me check my work...

4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3

So, first I think we should do the multiplication. That's what the * means, right? So, 4 * 3 is 12.

Next, we have the addition. That's what the + means, right? So, 12 + 2 is 14.

Therefore, the answer is 14.

The answer is 14."

First, I know that when we have parentheses, we need to do what's inside them first. So, I'll start by adding 2 and 5. That gives me 7.

Next, I need to multiply 4 by 7. That's easy - it's 28.

Now, I need to subtract 2 times 3. That's 6.

So, my final answer is 28 - 6, which is 22.
