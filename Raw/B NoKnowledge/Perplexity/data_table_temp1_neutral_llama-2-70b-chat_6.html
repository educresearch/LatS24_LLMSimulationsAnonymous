      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll give it my best shot!<br><br>So, the problem is 4*(2+5)+12-2*3, right?<br><br>First, I think we should do the multiplication. That's what the * symbol means, right? So, 4*2 is 8 and 4*5 is 20. Add them together and we get 28.<br><br>Next, we have 12. That's just a number, so we can add it to 28 and get 40.<br><br>Now, there's this minus sign (-) thingy. I think it means we have to subtract something. So, we have to subtract 2 times 3, which is 6.<br><br>But wait, there's more! We have to do something called "order of operations" apparently. That means we have to follow some rules. So, we have to do everything inside the parentheses first. That means we have to add 2 and 5 before we can multiply by 4.<br><br>Okay, so 2+5 is 7. Now we can multiply 4 by 7, which is 28.<br><br>So, the final answer is... (drumroll) 40 - 6 = 34!<br><br>The answer is 34. Woohoo, I did it!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thingy is all about. But let's try to solve this math problem together, shall we?<br><br>Okay, first, I see a bunch of numbers and symbols. I know I can start by multiplying 4 and 2+5, which gives me 4*7 = 28.<br><br>Next, I see a plus sign followed by 12. I know I can add 28 and 12, which gives me 40.<br><br>Finally, I see a minus sign followed by 2 times 3. I know I can subtract 6 from 40, which gives me 34.<br><br>The answer is 34!<br><br>I hope that's correct! Can you please tell me if I did it right? ðŸ˜Š</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this problem...<br><br>Okay, first we have 4 times something, and that something is 2 plus 5. That's 2 + 5 = 7.<br><br>So, 4 times 7 is... (thinking) 4 times 7 is 28.<br><br>Next, we have 12. That's an easy one! 12 is just 12.<br><br>Now, we have minus 2 times 3. That's -6.<br><br>So, if we add all these numbers together, we get... (thinking) 28 + 12 - 6 = 34!<br><br>The answer is 34! ðŸ˜„</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what the order of operations is. I think we're supposed to do the multiplication first, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 2+5. That gives me 4*7 = 28.<br><br>Next, I think I'm supposed to add 12, so I'll add 12 to 28, which gives me 40.<br><br>Finally, I'm supposed to subtract 2 times 3, which is 6. So, I'll subtract 6 from 40, which gives me 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

Let's start with the multiplication symbol, which looks like a big letter "X"! I know that means we have to multiply stuff together. There's a 4 and a 3, so if we multiply them, we get... 12!<br><br>But wait, there's more! There's a plus sign (+) and a 2! If we add 12 and 2, we get... 14!<br><br>The answer is 14! ðŸ˜ƒ</td>

Can you help me understand what PEMDAS is?<br><br>Oh, you said it stands for "Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction." That sounds a bit confusing.<br><br>Okay, let me try to solve the problem. 5 + 2... that's 7. Then there's a multiplication sign, and 4 is multiplied by 2, which is 8.
