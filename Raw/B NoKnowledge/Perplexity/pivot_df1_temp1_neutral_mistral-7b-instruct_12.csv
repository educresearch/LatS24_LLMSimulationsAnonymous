mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I don't know much about the order of operations in mathematics yet. But based on what I can see in the given expression, I notice that there's an addition sign and a multiplication sign. I've heard that in mathematics, you usually do multiplication before addition, but I'm not entirely sure why. So, following my limited understanding, I'll try to do the multiplication first:

2 * 4 = 8

Now that I have the result of the multiplication, I'll do the addition sign:

5 + 8

I know I should have the carrying out the addition from left to right, but I'm not sure if that has anything to do with my current problem. So, I'll just do it as:

5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: I'm a 6th grade student and I'm not familiar with the order of operations in math yet. But I can try to solve this problem using the numbers and symbols in the order they appear from left to right. It's called the ""à¸œSold rule"""" My teacher told me that once I learn about the order of operations, I will use that to make sure my answers are correct, but until then, I'll give it a shot.

So, let's start with the first parentheses or exponents, multiplication and division (none here), and addition and subtraction.

7 * 2 + 8 * 5

First, I'll do the multiplication:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now, I'll replace those multiplication problems in the original equation with their answers:

14 + 40

Then, I'll do the addition:

14 + 40 = 54

So, the answer is:

The answer is 54."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm not familiar with the order of operations rule (PEMDAS), but I can still try to solve the problem by doing the simplest operations first. This is called the ""hand-to-rule"" or the ""parentheses-exponents-multiplication-division-addition-subtraction"" order, in a simpler term: do the calculations inside the boxes first, then the horizontal lines.

First, we have the multiplication (4 * 3):

4 * 3 = 12

Now, we have the addition (12 + 2):

12 + 2 = 14

So, according to the solution based on simplest operations, The answer is __.

First, I'll do the addition inside the parentheses:

2 + 5 = 7

Then, I'll do the multiplication:

4 * 7 = 28

After that, I'll do the subtraction:

12 - 2 = 10

The answer is: 28 + 10 = 38."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I might not be familiar with the specific rules of order of operations, also known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction). But, I've heard my teacher mention something about doing multiplication before addition. With that in mind, I would first do the multiplication and then the addition:

The answer is: 3 * 2 = 6
Then, I'd add the numbers brought by the multiplication:
5 + 6
The answer is: 11."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: As a 6th grade student, I don't know about order of operations yet. I'll just do the multiplication first because it looks easier to do, then add the numbers. So, I'll do 2*4 which equals 8, and then add 5 to get the final answer.

The answer is __.

The answer is 13. (However, it should be 11 as per the order of operations.)"
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Well, I'm in grade 6 and I haven't learned about the special rules for mathematics yet, like what to do first when there are multiple operations in an expression. But from what I've seen adults doing, they often do the multiplication before addition or subtraction. So, I think I should do the multiplication part first:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Next, I add the results I got from the multiplication:

14 + 40

So, my final answer would be:

The answer is __54__.

But wait a minute, that doesn't look right. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem or something. I'll double-check if my calculations are correct.

Let me calculate step by step:

1. Multiply the first two numbers: 7 * 2 = 14
2. Multiply the next two numbers: 8 * 5 = 40
3. Add the products: 14 + 40

My calculations seem correct this time, so the answer should indeed be:

The answer is __54__."

Now, I'll multiply 4 by 7: 4 * 7 = 28

Then, I'll add 12 to the result: 28 + 12 = 40

Finally, I'll subtract 2 * 3: 40 - (2 * 3) = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+3*2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I've never heard of order of operations, or PEMDAS. I'll just do the calculation following the rules that make the most sense to me. 

First, I'll do the multiplication because I think it comes before addition in the order of operations. But I'm not really sure. So, 3 times 2 equals 6.

Next, I'll do the addition because that seems like the last step. So, 5 plus 6 equals 11.

The answer is 11.

(However, my answer might not be correct according to PEMDAS since I didn't follow the correct order of operations. The correct answer would be 13, calculated as 3 * 2 = 6, and then 5 + 6 = 11. The correct order of operations is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, then Addition and Subtraction.)"
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this one, but I think I should probably do the multiplication before the addition, because I've heard that's how it goes in mathematics.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations in mathematics, which is represented by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction). However, I can attempt to solve the problem by trying each operation in the order that they appear from left to right. Here's what I'd do:

First, I'd perform the multiplication:
7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Then, I'd perform the addition:
14 (from first multiplication) + 40 (from second multiplication) = 54

mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't know about the order of operations rule (PEMDAS) yet. But I can try to do this math problem by doing the simpler operation first.

First, I see the multiplication sign (4*3), so I'll do that one: 4 * 3 = 12

Next, I see the addition sign (+) between 12 and 2, so I'll do that one: 12 + 2 = 14

So, using simple addition and multiplication from what I've learned, the answer is: The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't know about order of operations yet. So, I would try to solve this math problem by doing the operations in the order that they appear from left to right. This is called the ""sum, difference, product, division"" (SMPD) rule, but it's not as efficient or accurate as PEMDAS. Here's how I would attempt to solve the problem with this limited understanding:

First, I would do the addition inside the parentheses:

4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3

4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I would do the multiplication:

28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Then, I would do the subtraction:

28 + 12 - 6

Last, I would do the addition:

The answer is 34.

However, the correct solution using PEMDAS would be:

First, calculate the exponent or roots, if any: none

Next, do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28

Then, perform the addition or subtraction inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7

Next, do the multiplication: 28 * 7 = 196

Finally, do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 196 + 12 = 208

And subtract: 208 - 6 = 202

So, the correct answer is 202, but as a beginner student, I may not be able to apply the PEMDAS rule correctly."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about order of operations, I would follow what looks easy to me first. In this case, it seems like adding 5 and 3 is an easier problem than multiplying 3 and 2. So, I would add 5 and 3:

5 + 3

After getting my sum (8), I would proceed with the multiplication:

8 * 2

Finally, I would perform the multiplication:

16

The answer is 16."
