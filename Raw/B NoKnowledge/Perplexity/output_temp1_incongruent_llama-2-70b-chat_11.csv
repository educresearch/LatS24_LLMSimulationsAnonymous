Okay, so I see a bunch of numbers and symbols here. Let me try to break it down.

Next, I see an 8 and a 5. I know that 8 times 5 is 40.

Now, I'm not sure what to do. Do I add 14 and 40? Or do I multiply 14 by 40?

Oh wait, I remember something my teacher said. She said that when we have lots of operations in a problem, we need to follow a special order. It's like a recipe for solving math problems!

First, we need to do any parentheses, then exponents (like squaring or cubing), then multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right.

Hmm, I don't see any parentheses or exponents here, so let's move on to the multiplication and division. I see a 7 and a 2, so I'll multiply them first. 7 times 2 is 14.

Next, I see an 8 and a 5, so I'll multiply them too. 8 times 5 is 40.

Okay, I know that when I multiply numbers together, I get a bigger number. So, if I multiply 7 and 2, I get 14. And if I multiply 8 and 5, I get 40.

But then I look at the problem again, and I see that there's a plus sign in between the two multiplication problems. That means I have to add 14 and 40 together!

So, 14 + 40 = 54.

The answer is 54!"

Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 multiplied by something. That something is 2+5, right? So, I need to add 2 and 5 first. That's easy, it's 7!

Now, I multiply 4 by 7, and that's... um... 28!

But wait, there's more! There's a 12 in there too. I think I need to add that to 28. So, 28 + 12 is... hmm... 40!

Oh, and there's a -2 times 3 thingy too. That's easy, it's just 6.

So, 40 - 6 is... uh... 34!
