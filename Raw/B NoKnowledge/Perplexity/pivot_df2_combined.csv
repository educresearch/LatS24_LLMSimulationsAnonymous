However, I can attempt to solve the problem by trying to follow a logical sequence that seems sensible to me.

First, I'll look for any parentheses or numbers inside parentheses since we thought they should be done first. But there are no parentheses in this problem, so let's move on to the next step.

I'll then try to do any multiplication and division from left to right since we learned that those should be done next, right? In this problem, we have: 4 * 2+5 and 2 * 3. Let's tackle the first one, 4 * 2+5. Since we've learned that multiplication comes before addition, I'll do the multiplication first: 4 * 2 = 8, so now it's 8+5. Adding those two numbers, I get 13. So the first part of the equation is now 13.

Next, we have 2 * 3. I'll apply the same logic, but since I haven't learned that multiplication is commutative, I must do multiplication with the number on the left first: 2 * 3 = 6.

Alright, I've done what I believe to be the multiplication part of the problem. The next steps in the equation include addition and subtraction. Let's add and subtract from left to right. I'll start with subtracting 2 from 13: 13-2 = 11. Now I have 11, and the problem asks me to add 12: 11+12 = 23.

So, based on my logical understanding as a 6th-grade student, The answer is 23.

Now, I have 4 * 7 + 12 and 2 * 3. I'll do the multiplication first:

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Next, I'll do the addition and subtraction in each part:

4 * 7 + 12 = 28 + 12 = 40

4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3

Initially, I see parentheses, and according to the basic arithmetic rules that I've learned, I should do the calculation inside the parentheses first.

So, 

4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3
4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3

First, we do the addition inside the parentheses:

So now our equation looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we do the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28
12 * 3 = 36

So now our equation looks like this: 28 + 36 - 2 * 3

Now, we do the subtraction that isn't inside parentheses:
36 - 2 * 3 = 34 (because 2 * 3 = 6, so 36 - 6 = 30, but we forgot about the + 28)

So now our equation looks like this: 28 + 34

Finally, we do the addition:
28 + 34 = 62

So, the answer is 62.

But, I think I made a mistake by doing the subtraction before the addition that wasn't inside parentheses. Let me try that again:

First, we do the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28
12 * 3 = 36

So now our equation looks like this: 28 + 12 + 36 - 2 * 3

Next, we do the addition inside the parentheses:
12 + 36 = 48

So now our equation looks like this: 28 + 48 - 2 * 3

Now, we do the subtraction that isn't inside parentheses:
48 - 2 * 3 = 46 (because 2 * 3 = 6, so 48 - 6 = 42, but we forgot about the + 28)

So now our equation looks like this: 28 + 46

My teacher also said that sometimes there's a special order that we follow when we do math, like taking an apple out of a basket and then eating it, not the other way around. Maybe there's a special order for this problem too! I've heard people call it the order of operations or something like that. Let me try to remember what those rules are...

Okay, here are the rules I think I remember: We do the things inside the parentheses first, then we do the exponents (if there are any), followed by multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally we do addition and subtraction (from left to right). Let's see if this helps!

Following these rules, I think we should do the multiplication first. So that's 4 times 3, which is 12 as we figured out earlier. Now, the problem doesn't have any parentheses or exponents, so the next step is to do the addition. So that's 12 plus 2, which makes 14.

The answer is 14."
neutral,18,mistral-7b-instruct,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem. I know that in mathematics we have to follow certain rules when solving an expression. Sandwich rules, perhaps? Let me try following those.

First, according to the sandwich rules, we do anything inside the parentheses first. But, in this case, there are no parentheses. So, I guess the next rule is to do any exponents. There aren't any exponents either, though. I think I should do multiplication and division from left to right.

Let's apply that. First, 2 times 4 equals 8. Then, 5 plus 8. That gives me 13.

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I have not learned about the order of operations yet. So, let's just do the calculation following the simple rule: addition before multiplication.

Here's what I would do:

1. I would first do the multiplication (2*4 = 8), then add the numbers (5 + 8).

So, the calculation would look like this:
5 + 2*4 = 5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: Well, I'm just a little elementary school student, I don't know much about the special rules for math yet. But I can tell you what I see in this problem: there's an addition sign and a multiplication sign. Yeah, I've heard numbers and operations mentioned in the wrong order can change the answer, but I don't know which one to do first. Let's try this out:

Multiplication comes before addition, right? That's what I've heard my teacher say. So, first, I'll do the multiplication:

2*4 = 8 (I got this by repeating the number 2 and adding it to itself 4 times)

Now, I've got this 8 and a 5 from the addition. Which one should I do now? I don't remember the rule, but I'll try doing the addition:

5 + 8 = 13

So, that's my answer. I'm not sure if it's correct, but let's see what my teacher thinks:

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't know about order of operations in mathematics yet. So, I will do the calculation step by step as I see it. I'll start with the addition: 5 + 2, then do the multiplication: 2 * 4. That gives me 10 from the multiplication and 7 from the addition. Therefore, I'll do 7 + 10 to get the final answer.

The answer is __17__. :)

(Note: In standard mathematical notation, the correct order of operations, also known as PEMDAS - Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right) - would yield a result of 13 for this problem, but since this persona doesn't know about these rules yet, the solution provided above is based on the order I perceived and performed the operations, which happens to still give a valid result even if not following the standard order of operations yet.)"

I see that there's an addition sign (5 +) but also a multiplication sign (3*2). I guess we should do the multiplication first since I've learned that multiplication comes before addition in many situations, even though I don't completely understand why just yet.

Next, I will multiply: 4 * 7 equals 28 and 2 * 3 equals 6. Now, we have 28 + 12 - 6.

This approach is called ""order of operations,"" but I don't know that yet. Here's how I would work through this problem:

1. First, I would do the operation inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5, giving me 7.
2. Next, I would do the multiplication on the far left side of the problem, 4 \* 7, which equals 28.
3. Then, I would continue from left to right and do the next multiplication, which is 2 \* 3, giving me 6.
4. Finally, I would do the addition and subtraction from left to right: first, add 28 + 12, which equals 40, and then subtract 6 from it, leaving me with 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Okay, so I don't know about any order of operations or special rules for doing math. I just know how to do things in the order that they're written, from left to right. 

So first, I'll do the operation that's closest to the left side of the equation: the multiplication sign between the 4 and the opening parenthesis. That means I need to multiply 4 by whatever is inside the parentheses.

Inside the parentheses, I see another operation: addition. I'll do that next, adding 2 and 5 to get 7.

Now, I replace the (2+5) in the original equation with the result, 7:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I'll do the multiplication next to the 7: 4 times 7 equals 28.

Now, the equation looks like this:

28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Now, I just do the operations from left to right. I add 28 and 12 to get 40.

Now, the equation looks like this:

40 - 2 * 3

40 - 6

No, it's actually for multiplication. So, let's do that first. That gives us:

2 * 4 = 8

5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: Well, I'm just a 6th grade student and we haven't learnt anything about the order of operations yet.But I can tell you that when we do the arithmetic in this expression, we should probably do the multiplication before the addition, as the * symbol represents multiplication and + represents addition.

1. I see the addition sign first, so I think I should add 5 and 4 right away. But, 4 is a part of 2*4, which is a multiplication problem.
2. I'm unsure of which operation to do first. Let's see if we can simplify the problem somehow before trying to add or multiply.

The answer is: I'm not confident in my answer without knowing the order of operations rule. Instead, I'd ask my teacher or classmate for help.

Let's follow these steps:

1. Solve the expression inside the parentheses: (2+5) = 7
2. Multiply 4 with 7: 4 * 7 = 28
3. Next, we have 12 - 2 * 3. Since we need to follow the subtraction after multiplication, we should solve the multiplication first: 2 * 3 = 6. Now, subtract this product from 12: 12 - 6 = 6.

Let me try to solve this problem, 5+2 * 4, based on what I think might be the right order.

First, I'll do the multiplication since it looks like it comes before the addition in the given expression. So, 2 * 4 equals 8. Now, the expression becomes 5 + 8.

Answer: 11.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I have not learned about the order of operations in mathematics yet. So when I encounter a problem like this one, I might try to follow some simple rules to get an answer. Here is how I would approach this problem:

1. I would first add the numbers inside the parentheses if there were any. But in this problem, there are no parentheses.
2. Next, I would do multiplication and division, from left to right, if there were any. But in this problem, there is only multiplication (3 times 2).
3. Finally, I would perform addition and subtraction, also from left to right, if there were any. But in this problem, there is only addition (5 added to the product of 3 and 2).

So, based on these simple rules, I would first do the multiplication (3 times 2), which equals 6. Then, I would add the result (6) to the number 5, giving me a final answer of 11.

So, let's apply these rules step by step to the given expression:

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in this expression, so we move on to the next rule.
2. Exponents: There are no exponents either, so let's proceed to multiplication and division.
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right): We see two multiplication signs, so we will perform both multiplication operations. The first one is 4*(2 + 5).

My teacher tells me that we need to follow a certain rule when doing math. It's called the order of operations, or PEMDAS for short. That stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this case, we have multiplication, so we should do that before the addition. So, let's calculate 3 multiplied by 2, which equals 6.

Now, we have addition, so we should do that. Let's add 5 and 6.

First, I would do the multiplication: 7*2 and 8*5

So, the calculations would look like this:
7*2 = 14
8*5 = 40

Now, I would do the addition of the results of the multiplication:
14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Well, I've heard that when doing mathematics, there's an important rule to follow so that the solution is correct. It's called order of operations. But honestly, I have no idea what it's called or what it means! However, I've been told that when there are two or more operations in one expression, we must perform them in a certain order. I think it goes something like this:

1. Parentheses/Brackets
2. Exponents (powers)
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Alright, based on that brief description, let's try to solve our problem, 7*2 + 8*5:

1. We don't have any parentheses or exponents in our problem, so we move on to the next steps.
2. We have multiplication, so we'll do that:
   - First, we do the multiplication on the left side: 7 * 2 = 14
   - Then, we do the multiplication on the right side: 8 * 5 = 40
3. Now, we have addition, so we'll do that:

Then, I'd multiply 4 by 7, since there are no other operations with a higher precedence, giving me 28.

Next, I'd add 12 to 28, resulting in 40.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: If I was given the mathematics problem ""4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3"" and I didn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would probably solve it from left to right. However, this can lead to incorrect results, as the order of operations is a rule that ensures consistent and proper calculation.

Using the order of operations, we first perform the operation inside the parentheses, then any exponents, followed by multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally addition and subtraction (from left to right).

So, for this problem, we would first solve (2+5) to get 7, then do the multiplication, then the addition, and finally the subtraction.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Calculate the expression in the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7
2. Multiply: 4 * 7 = 28
3. Add: 28 + 12 = 40
4. Multiply: 2 * 3 = 6
5. Subtract: 40 - 6 = 34

The equation now looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

Now, I see addition and subtraction, and since there's no order for those, I'll do them from left to right: 28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 6 is 34.

Now, I have 5 plus 8. That's an easy one! Eight added to five is thirteen, so...

The answer is __13__.

(Note: While student-level intuition is often correct in performing the multiplication before addition, it does not hold true for all more complex mathematical expressions where other operations may have higher priority. Therefore, it's essential to learn and apply the Order of Operations, or PEMDAS rule, correctly for precise and accurate results in mathematics as students progress in their education. mastery of these concepts will lead them further in their academic journey.)","GPT Response: Well, I'm just a grade 6 student, so I'm not really sure about these complex math rules yet. But, I think I should do the multiplication first, then add the numbers, right? So, let's try that:

Then, I'll add the numbers: 5 + 8

The answer is: 13. (But I'm not completely sure about this, maybe I should double-check with my teacher!)","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I have not learned about order ofoperations yet. So, I would follow what seems most logical to me, which is to do multiplication before addition. Therefore, I would first multiply 2 and 4 to get 8, and then add 5 to get the final answer.

The answer is: 5 + 2*4 = 5 + 8 = 13. (But I know now that I made a mistake, and the correct answer is 11 following PEMDAS rule.)","GPT Response: I see numbers and some symbols on this paper. The plus sign (+) means we add numbers, and the asterisk (*) means we do multiplication. But I don't know which operation to do first because the numbers aren't in parentheses.

First, I thought we do addition and subtraction before multiplication and division. So, I think I should do the multiplication part first, since there's a multiplication sign (*) between 3 and 2.

3 multiplied by 2 equals 6.

So, now the equation looks like this: 5 + 6.

Next, let's do the multiplication:

4 * 7 = 28

4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3

Now I have:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I'll do the multiplication since there are numbers being multiplied. Let's do the one on the left first:

28 (4 * 7) + 12 - 2 * 3

Now I have:
28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I'll do the addition and subtraction. I'll start with the subtraction, then the addition since there's a minus sign before the multiplication:

28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Now I have:
28 + 12 - 6

We have 5 + 3 * 2

First, we need to look for any parentheses or exponents. In this case, there are neither.

I'm not sure which one I should do first, but I think I need to follow some rules. Let's call them Rule 1 and Rule 2.

Rule 1: If you have an operation inside parentheses, do that first.
Rule 2: (From what I remember, but I'm not totally sure) When you have multiple operations that aren't inside parentheses, you do the ones with numbers and exponents first, and then the multiplication and division, and lastly, addition and subtraction.

Well, there are no parentheses in this problem, so let's see if I can use Rule 2. According to Rule 2, I should first do the multiplications since there are no exponents in this problem. So, I do 7 times 2 and 8 times 5:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

2 + 5 = 7

Now, let's do multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28
12 * 3 = 36

First, let's do the operations inside the parentheses:

2 + 5 = 7

Now, let's do the multiplication:

4 * 7 = 28

Then, subtraction:

28 + 12 = 40

And the last one:

40 - 2 * 3

Since we shouldn't do the multiplication before the subtraction according to the rules my teacher mentioned, I'll do the subtraction first:

40 - 2 = 38

The order of operations is like a recipe. We have to follow the steps in the recipe to make sure our math is correct. The steps are:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents (like squaring or cubing)
3. Multiplication and Division (we do these in the order they appear from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (we do these in the order they appear from left to right)

Now, let's look at the problem: 7 * 2 + 8 * 5.

4 * (2 + 5)

Now, I remember that inside the parentheses, we do the addition before the multiplication. So, let me calculate the number inside the parentheses first.

First, I see that there's an addition sign and a multiplication sign in the problem. From what I've learned, you usually do multiplication before addition. So that's what I'll do first.

I'll do the multiplication: 3 * 2 = 6

Then, I'll do the addition: 5 + 6

And that's it! According to my simple understanding, that's how you solve this problem.

The answer is: 11.","GPT Response: Well, I'm just a little kid and we haven't learned about the order of operations yet. But we can try to solve this problem in a simple way. I'd do multiplication before addition because the multiplication sign looks like it's telling us to do that first! So I'll start with 3 multiplied by 2, which makes 6. Then I'll add 5 to get the final answer.

The answer is: 5 + 3 * 2 = 5 + 6 = 11. (But big kids know this isn't the correct answer according to the PEMDAS rule!)"

That means we have to follow a certain order when we're doing math problems, right?

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: Well, I know that in mathematics we have numbers and some special symbols, like the plus sign ""+"", the minus sign ""-"", and the asterisk ""*"" which means multiplication. But I don't really understand the order in which we should do these operations yet. I guess I should try to do the multiplication before the addition, just because the multiplication symbol is usually bigger than the addition symbol, but I'm not completely sure. Let me give it a try: First, I'll do the multiplication: 2 * 4 = 8. Now I have 5 + 8. I think I should do the addition now: 5 + 8 = 13. The answer is 13.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I have not learned about the order of operations in mathematics yet, so I would try to solve the problem by doing the simple addition first and then the multiplication. Here's my solution:

First, I'll do the addition (5 + 2). The sum of 5 and 2 is 7.

Next, I'll do the multiplication (2 * 4). The product of 2 and 4 is 8.

Now, I'll substitute the results of the addition and multiplication into the original expression and find the final answer:

The answer is 7 + 8.

However, without the order of operations rule, my answer may not be the correct one according to the mathematical rules. The correct answer would be 21 (using PEMDAS: 2 * 4 = 8, then 5 + 8 = 13, and finally 13 + 3 = 16, but 3 was mistakenly used instead of 4 in the final addition). So, although this is how a beginner student may incorrectly approach the problem, we know that the answer is actually 21.","GPT Response: Hmm, I'm not sure which operation to do first. Let me try this:

First, I'll do the multiplication because I think that's what the asterisk (*) means in math. So, I'll do 2 times 4, which makes 8.

Next, I'll do the addition with the result I got, which is 8, and the number I have left, which is 5. So, I'll add those two numbers together.

The answer is: 8 + 5 = 13.

Let's see, there's something called PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Looking at the given problem, I don't see any parentheses or exponents. So the first rule out is Parentheses.

The next rule is Multiplication and Division. But there's only one * sign, so it's not Division. That means it must be Multiplication.

Now we have 3*2. According to the Multiplication rule in PEMDAS, we should do this before Addition and Subtraction. So I'll calculate that first.

3 multiplied by 2 equals 6.

PEMDAS is similar, standing for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: If I was given this math problem and didn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would solve the problem from left to right. This is called ""ordinary computation"" or ""order of operations without considering the hierarchy of operations"".

So, I would do the multiplication and addition in order from left to right:

4 \* (2 + 5) = 4 \* 7 = 28
2 + 5 = 7
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2 \* 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.

But actually, I made a mistake here because I didn't follow the order of operations, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). I needed to do the operation inside the parentheses first before doing the multiplication outside. The correct order of operations should be:

2 + 5 = 7
4 \* 7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2 \* 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is still 34, but I got this answer by following the correct order of operations (PEMDAS). If you didn't know this rule before, now you know it! The answer is 34.","GPT Response: I don't know about order of operations yet, but I know that we should do the operations in this order: parentheses, multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally addition and subtraction (from left to right).

Then, I'll do the addition part with the result I got: 5 plus 8 equals 13.

So, here's the solution using the advice of a fictional imaginary teacher: We did the multiplication first because the asterisk (*) looks like it's asking for it to be done before the addition sign (+), but in reality, with simple numbers like these, it doesn't really matter much if we follow that hint or not. But let's go with what the asterisk suggests for now: The answer is 13.

However, this technique might not always be correct and could lead to incorrect answers with more complicated expressions, as there is a systematic rule called the ""PEMDAS"" algorithm that helps us solve expressions more accurately, and following it is essential to ensure the proper execution of Mathematical operations. I will share this information with my teacher and my classmates when we learn about order of operations in the future.
