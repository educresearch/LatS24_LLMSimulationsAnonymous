      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll give it my best shot.<br><br>So, the first thing I see is the 4 and the multiplication sign, so I think I should do that first. Then I see the addition sign and the numbers 2 and 5, so I add them up and get 7. Then I see the plus sign and the number 12, so I add that to 7 and get 19. Finally, I see the minus sign and the numbers 2 and 3, so I subtract 3 from 19 and get 16.<br><br>The answer is 16.<br><br>I hope that's right! If not, sorry, I did my best with what I knew. ðŸ˜…</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you explain it to me?<br><br>Oh, you want me to try to solve it anyway? Well, okay. Let's see...<br><br>4 times 2 is 8, plus 5 is 13. Then, plus 12 is 25. Minus 2 times 3 is... um... 2 times 3 is 6. So, 25 minus 6 is... 19?<br><br>The answer is 19.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so we have this big equation: 4*(2+5)+12-2*3.<br><br>First, we need to do the stuff inside the parentheses. That's 2+5, which is 7.<br><br>So, now we have 4*7. Let's do that: 4 times 7 is 28.<br><br>Next, we have 12. We just add 12 to 28, so now we have 40.<br><br>Finally, we have -2*3. That's minus 6. We add minus 6 to 40, and we get 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, let's see...<br><br>First, I need to follow the rules of multiplication. I have a 4 and a 2+5, so I need to multiply 4 and 2+5 together. That gives me 4*7 = 28.<br><br>Next, I have a 12. I need to add 12 to 28, so that gives me 40.<br><br>Lastly, I have a -2*3. I need to subtract 6 from 40, so that gives me 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

That gives me 12.<br><br>Now, I see a plus sign (+) followed by the number 2. I'm not sure what to do with the plus sign, but I think it means I have to add something.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I think I can help you with that problem!<br><br>So, we have 4*3, that's 12, right? And then we have 2, that's 2!<br><br>So, if we add 12 and 2, we get... 14!<br><br>The answer is 14!</td>

So, I think I'll start by adding 5 and 2, which gives me 7.<br><br>Next, I see that there's a multiplication symbol (*) in the problem. I'm not sure what to do with it, but I think it means we have to multiply 2 and 4. That gives me 8.<br><br>Now, I'm not sure what to do with 8.

      <td>GPT Response: Hi there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure how to solve this problem. Let me think about it for a moment...<br><br>Okay, I know that when you have a bunch of numbers and operations in a sentence, you have to follow a special order to make sure you do the right calculations. I think it's called PEMDAS or something like that.<br><br>So, let's see... first, I think I need to do the multiplication. That's the part where you have numbers and you multiply them together, like 2 times 4. That gives me 8.<br><br>Next, I need to do the addition. That's the part where you add up all the numbers that are left. So, I have 5 and 8, and if I add them together, I get 13.<br><br>So, the answer to the problem 5+2*4 is 13!<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so we have this math problem: 5+2*4.<br><br>First, let's start with the multiplication. 2 times 4 is equal to 8.<br><br>Now, let's add 5 and 8. 5 + 8 = 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

So, 3 * 2 = 6.<br><br>Now, we have 5 + 6. We should add these two numbers together, so 5 + 6 = 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>

Let's see...<br><br>First, I know that when we have addition and multiplication in a problem, we have to do the multiplication first. That's because multiplication is like repeating addition, and we have to do it in a specific order. So, I'll start by multiplying 3 and 2.<br><br>3*2 = 6<br><br>Okay, now I have my result from the multiplication. It's 6. Next, I need to add 5 to 6.<br><br>6 + 5 = 11<br><br>The answer is 11!</td>

I think I'm supposed to add 14 and 40, but I'm not sure. Can you help me?<br><br>Oh, wait, I think I remember something about parentheses. I think we're supposed to do the stuff inside the parentheses first. There aren't any parentheses in this problem, but I think we're supposed to pretend like there are. So, let's see... 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40. If we pretend like there are parentheses, it would be like this: (14) + (40).<br><br>Now, we can add them together, and the answer is... 54!
