systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: Well, I don't know much about complicated math rules, but I remember my teacher saying something about doing calculations in a certain order. I think it's called PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Let's apply that rule here:

1. First, we need to solve the Parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.
2. Now we have 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.
3. Next is Multiplication and Division: 4 times 7 equals 28 and 2 times 3 equals 6.
4. So now our equation is: 28 + 12 - 6.
5. Finally, we do Addition and Subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 equals 40, then 40 - 6 equals 34.

The answer is 34."

But I remember my teacher mentioning something called ""PEMDAS"" which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). So I should follow that rule.

First, I'll do the multiplication: 3 * 2 = 6
Then, I'll do the addition: 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11."
