That means I would add 2 + 5 to get 7, and then subtract 2 from 12 to get 10. So now the expression looks like this: 

4 * 7 + 10 - 2 * 3

Next, I would do the multiplication. I would multiply 4 by 7 to get 28, and 2 by 3 to get 6. So now the expression looks like this:

28 + 10 - 6

Finally, I would do the addition and subtraction from left to right. That means I would first add 28 and 10 to get 38, and then subtract 6 from 38 to get 32.

The answer is 32."

But let me try it both ways to see what happens.

If I do the addition first, I get 8. Then I multiply that result by 2, and I get 16.

If I do the multiplication first, I get 6. Then I add that result to 5, and I also get 11.

Wait, something is not right! I got two different answers. I should ask my teacher about this.

My teacher explains that there is a special rule called the order of operations, which says that we need to do multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. So, for my problem, I should do the multiplication first: 3 times 2 equals 6, and then I add 5, which gives me 11.

The answer is 11."
