First, I know that when we have multiplication, we do it first. So, I'll do the multiplication parts:

7*2 = 14
8*5 = 40

Now, I need to add them together:

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54!"

I think I'm supposed to do the things inside the parentheses first, so I'll start by adding 2 and 5. That gives me 7.

Next, I need to multiply 4 by 7, which gives me 28.

Then, I need to add 12 to that, which gives me 40.

Finally, I need to subtract 2 times 3, which is 6.

So, the answer is 40 - 6, which is 34.

The answer is 34."
