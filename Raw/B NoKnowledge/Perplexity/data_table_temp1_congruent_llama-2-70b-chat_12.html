      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not really sure about this order of operations thing. But I'll give it my best shot!<br><br>Okay, so I see a bunch of numbers and symbols here. Let's start with the multiplication. I know that's the first thing we're supposed to do. So, 4 times 2 plus 5 is... hmm... 4 times 2 is 8, and then plus 5 is 13.<br><br>Next, I see a plus sign! That means I have to add something. So, 12 plus 13 is... um... 25!<br><br>Now, there's a minus sign. Oh no! That means I have to subtract something. Let's see... 25 minus 2 times 3 is... hmm... 25 minus 6 is 19.<br><br>So, the answer is 19! Woohoo, I did it!<br><br>The answer is 19.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm trying to solve this math problem, and I'm not really sure how to do it. I know it's got something to do with this PEMDAS thingy, but I don't really understand what that means. Can you help me out?<br><br>Okay, so the problem is 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3. I think I need to do the multiplication first, so that's 4*7, right? That's 28. Then, I need to add 12, which is 40. Okay, so far I have 40.<br><br>Now, I need to do the subtraction. I need to subtract 2 times 3, which is 6. So, 40 - 6 is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.<br><br>I hope that's right! Can you tell me if I did it correctly?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this problem for a bit!<br><br>Okay, first let's start with the multiplication part. We have 4 times something, and that something is 2 plus 5. That's 2+5, which equals 7! So, 4 times 7 is 28.<br><br>Now, we have some addition and subtraction left. Let's see... we have 12 plus 28, that's 40. But then we have 2 times 3, that's 6. So, we subtract 6 from 40, and that gives us 34.<br><br>The answer is 34!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, let's see...<br><br>First, we have the part that says 4 times something. That's easy! 4 times 2 is 8, and 4 times 5 is 20. So, 4 times 2 plus 5 is 8 + 20, which is 28.<br><br>Next, we have the plus sign. That means we add some numbers. We have 12, and then we have 2 times 3, which is 6. So, 12 plus 6 is 18.<br><br>Lastly, we have the minus sign. That means we subtract one number from another. We have 18 minus 2, which is 16.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 16.<br><br>The answer is 16.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think... Ok, I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll do the multiplication first. 4 times 3 is 12. Then, I'll add 2 to 12, which makes it 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, I'm trying my best here! So, 4*3 means we have to multiply 4 and 3, which gives us 12. Then we have +2, which means we add 2 to 12, so that gives us 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to follow some rules to solve this problem, but I don't know what they are yet. Hmm... let me think.<br><br>Well, first I see a bunch of numbers, so I'll just start by adding them up. So, 4 + 3 is 7, and then there's a 2 at the end, so that's 7 + 2, which is 9!<br><br>The answer is 9.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, okay, let me think about this...<br><br>First, I know that the multiplication symbol, which looks like a big cross, comes before the addition symbol, which looks like a little plus sign. So, I think I need to do the multiplication part first.<br><br>2*4 is equal to 8.<br><br>Now, I need to add 5 to 8, which gives me 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.<br><br>Can you please tell me if that's correct?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do the operations in a special order, but I don't know what that order is. I think it's like, do the multiplication first, then the addition? So, let's see... 2 times 4 is 8, then plus 5 is... hmm, that's a tricky one. I think it's 13. The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...<br><br>First, I know that the * symbol means multiply, so I'll do that part first.<br>2*4 = 8<br><br>Next, I see a + sign, so I'll add 5 and 8.<br>5 + 8 = 13<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm trying to solve this math problem, 5 + 3*2. I'm not sure what this * thing means, but I think it might have something to do with multiplication.<br><br>So, I'm gonna start by adding 5 and 3, which gives me 8. Then, I'm gonna multiply 3 by 2, which gives me 6.<br><br>Now, I'm not sure what to do next. I think I'm supposed to add 8 and 6, but I'm not sure. I hope that's right!<br><br>Okay, so I added 8 and 6, and I got 14. I think that's the right answer!<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think... Ok, I know that when you have a lot of numbers and symbols in a math problem, you have to follow some rules to figure out what to do first. I think it's like a recipe for cooking, you have to do certain steps in a certain order or it won't turn out right.<br><br>So, in this problem, I see that there's a 5 and a 3, and then a star that means multiplication.
