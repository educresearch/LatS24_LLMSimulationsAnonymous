      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm just a grade 6 student, and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>Okay, so I see a bunch of numbers and symbols here. Let me break it down step by step.<br><br>First, I see 4*. I know that means I have to multiply 4 by something. Oh, wait! There's a parentheses! It says 2+5. Hmm, I think I have to add 2 and 5 first. That's 7, right? So, 4*7 is... umm... 28!<br><br>Next, I see a plus sign (+). That means I have to add something else. Oh, there's a 12! So, 28 + 12 is... let me see... 40!<br><br>But wait, there's a minus sign (-) too! I have to subtract something. Uh-oh, it's 2 times 3! That's 6. So, 40 - 6 is... 34.<br><br>The answer is 34!<br><br>I hope that's right! Can someone tell me if I did it correctly?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you explain it to me?<br><br>Oh, you want me to try my best? Okay, let's see...<br><br>I think I should start by multiplying 4 and 2+5 because it's inside parentheses. That gives me 4*7 = 28.<br><br>Next, I see a plus sign, so I think I should add 12 to 28, which gives me 40.<br><br>Finally, I see a minus sign, so I think I should subtract 2 times 3 from 40, which gives me 36.<br><br>The answer is 36.<br><br>I hope that's correct!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?<br><br>Okay, I see that there are lots of numbers and symbols in the problem. Let me try to break it down.<br><br>First, I see a 4 and a 2. I know that 4 times 2 is 8.<br><br>Next, I see a + sign and a 5. I know that 8 + 5 is 13.<br><br>Then, I see a ) symbol. I'm not sure what that means, but I think it means I should do the next step.<br><br>After that, I see a 12. I know that 13 + 12 is 25.<br><br>Finally, I see a - sign and a 3. I know that 25 - 3 is 22.<br><br>So, the answer is 22!<br><br>The answer is 22.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! Let's see...<br><br>First, we have to do the stuff inside the parentheses. That's 2+5, which is 7.<br><br>So, now we have 4*7. That's 28.<br><br>Next, we have 12.<br><br>After that, we have 2*3, which is 6.<br><br>Finally, we subtract 6 from 28, and that gives us 22.<br><br>The answer is 22!</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what this "PEMDAS" thing is, but I know how to do addition and multiplication!<br><br>So, first, I would add 5 and 2, which gives me 7.<br><br>Then, I would multiply 4 by 7, which gives me 28.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 28.<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, but I don't know why. I just know that's how we do it. So, I'll do the multiplication first. 2 times 4 is 8. Now, I add 5 and 8, and that's 13. The answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hi there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure how to solve this problem using something called PEMDAS.

I know I need to add 14 and 40, but I don't know what order to do it in. Can you tell me what to do?<br><br>Oh, I see!
