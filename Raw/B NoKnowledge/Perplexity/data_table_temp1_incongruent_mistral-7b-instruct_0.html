So the problem becomes: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>3. Then, I'll do the remaining multiplication: 2 * 3 = 6. So the problem becomes: 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>4.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure about this, but I think we need to follow some rules when doing mathematics calculations, right? I mean, there's usually an order we're supposed to follow. This rule is called order of operations, or sometimes PEMDAS for short. It stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>So, let me try applying that to our problem: 4 * 3 + 2<br><br>First, we should check if there are any parentheses or exponents: no, there are none.<br><br>Next, we can do the multiplication and division, going from left to right:<br><br>1.

      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't know about the order of operations yet. I'd just follow the way the symbols look from left to right and do whatever operation I come across first.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just a 6th grader, and we haven't learned the order of operations yet, so let's try to make sense of this problem step by step.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just an elementary school student and I haven't learned about order of operations yet. But I can tell you this: when doing a math problem, we usually follow this simple rule - we do whatever is inside the parentheses first, then exponents (if any), then multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right. But, in this question, there are no parentheses or exponents, so let's see what we can do:<br><br>We have addition (5 +) and multiplication (3 * 2) in the problem. According to my understanding, we usually do multiplication before addition, but in this case, there's no clear rule to dictate which sign should be done first since they're not nested inside parentheses. So I guess we just have to do it one step at a time:<br><br>First, let's do the multiplication (3 * 2) to get 6.<br>Then, let's do the addition (5 +): 5 + 6 = 11.<br><br>So, The answer is __.<br>Answer: 11.</td>
