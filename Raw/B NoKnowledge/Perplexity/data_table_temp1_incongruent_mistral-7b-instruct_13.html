      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations in mathematics, which is usually represented by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction). Let's decipher this problem step by step based on what I feel makes sense:<br><br>1. I see parentheses in the expression. I think I'll do that part first:<br>   The numbers inside the parentheses are 2 and 5. When I add them, I get 7.<br><br>2. Next, I see multiplication signs (*). I've heard that numbers should be multiplied before adding or subtracting:<br>   In the first multiplication, I have 4 * 7, which I multiply to get 28.<br>   In the second multiplication, I have 2 * 3, which I multiply to get 6.<br><br>3. Now, I'm left with addition and subtraction symbols. Here, I believe I should add or subtract numbers from left to right. However, I'm not sure if order of multiplications has already affected the numbers:<br>   Since I don't have enough information about the influence of multiplications on the addition and subtraction part, I would encourage an expert mathematician to double-check my result.<br><br>The answer is ______________. (At this point, although I've performed some operations, I can't determine the exact answer as I'm unsure of the impact previous multiplications have on the addition and subtraction part. I strongly suggest consulting an expert.)<br><br>Here is the detailed reasoning:<br>1. Evaluate the expression within the parentheses, 2+5=7<br>2. Multiply: 4 * 7 = 28<br>  and 2 * 3 = 6<br>3. Unable to determine the exact final answer based on my current understanding.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just a grade 6 student and we haven't learned about the order of operations yet. But I can try to solve the problem by doing the operations inside the parentheses first, then the exponents (which we don't have), then multiplication, and finally addition and subtraction. So, let's do that:<br><br>First, I see there's an addition inside the parentheses, so I'll do that: 2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now, I have 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I'll do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28, 2 * 3 = 6<br><br>Now, I have 28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Then, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40, 40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So, the answer is: The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I'm not familiar with the order of operations rule (PEMDAS) yet. I would approach this problem by doing the operations inside the parentheses first. Here's my thought process:<br><br>1. Inside the first parentheses, I see the addition operation (2 + 5). I'd do that by adding the numbers: 2 + 5 = 7.<br>2. Next, I see the multiplication operation (4 * 7). I'd do that by multiplying the numbers: 4 * 7 = 28.<br>3. Then, I move on to the second parentheses and see the multiplication operation (2 * 3). I'd do that by multiplying the numbers: 2 * 3 = 6.<br>4. Finally, I have the last addition operation (28 + 12) and the subtraction operation (-2 * 3). I'd do the addition first (28 + 12 = 38) and then the subtraction (38 - 6 = 32).<br><br>So, following the steps I mentioned, the answer is: The answer is 32.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I don't really know about the order of operations in mathematics yet. But let me try to solve this problem step by step, like my teacher taught me. First, I will do the operations inside the parentheses. That gives me:<br><br>4 * (2+5) +12-2 * 3 = 4 * 7 +12-2 * 3<br><br>Next, I will do the multiplication because my teacher said to do that before addition and subtraction. So, I will do the multiplication on the left side:<br><br>4 * 7 +12-2 * 3 = 28 +12-2 * 3<br><br>Now, I need to do the addition and subtraction from left to right. Let's start with the subtraction:<br><br>28 +12-2 * 3 = 28 +12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Now, I will do the multiplication, and my teacher said that multiplication comes before addition and subtraction, so:<br><br>28 +12 - 2 * 3 = 28 +12 - 6<br><br>And finally, I will do the addition:<br><br>28 +12 - 6 = 40 - 6<br><br>The answer is 34. (But my teacher might say it is 40-6=34)</td>

      <td>GPT Response: As a sixth-grade student who doesn't know about order of operations yet, I would follow these steps based on the rules I've learned so far:<br><br>1.

      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I don't know about PEMDAS yet, so I'll just do the operation based on the order they're given: <br><br>First, I'll do the multiplication (because it comes before addition according to the rules I know): <br><br>4 * 3 = 12<br><br>Then, I'll do the addition: <br><br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>So, the answer is: <br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I might try to do the multiplication and addition at the same time, without considering the order of operations. I would first try to add 3 and 2 to get 5, and then I would try to multiply 4 and 5. But when I do this, I realize that I made a mistake because I should have completed the multiplication first according to the rules I have heard about math. So, I would go back and correctly follow the rules of order of operations, which is to do the multiplication before the addition. Therefore, the answer is:<br><br>The answer is 12. (So, 4 * 3 = 12, then 12 + 2 = 14, but we discard the intermediate result and use the final one from the multiplication, as we follow the PEMDAS rule.)</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I know that you write the numbers down in the order you're supposed to perform the operations, but I'm not really sure what those rules are called yet. I'll just do it like this: I'll do the multiplication first, then the addition. So, I'll do 4 times 3, which equals 12, and then I'll add 2 to it. So, 12 plus 2 equals 14. The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations rule called PEMDAS. I can only do the arithmetic from left to right and follow the brackets, if any. In this problem, there are no brackets to consider, so I'll do this:<br><br>I'll start with the multiplication (2 * 4) because it appears before the addition in the given sequence:<br><br>2 * 4 = 8<br><br>Now, I'll add the results from the multiplication and the first number of the addition:<br><br>5 + 8 = 13<br><br>So, following my current understanding, I would solve the problem that way.
