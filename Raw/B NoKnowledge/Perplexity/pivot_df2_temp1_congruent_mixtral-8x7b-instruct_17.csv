mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Sure, I'll do my best to answer this math question as a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about order of operations yet.

At first glance, this problem looks a bit confusing because it has addition, subtraction, and multiplication all mixed together. But I know that I can do the operations inside the parentheses first. So I'll start by adding 2 + 5, which equals 7.

Now the problem looks like this: 4 \* 7 + 12 - 2 \* 3.

Next, I see that there are still some multiplication and addition left to do. I don't know about order of operations yet, so I'll just do the multiplication and addition from left to right.

First, I'll do 4 \* 7, which equals 28.

Now the problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2 \* 3.

Next, I'll do the addition, which gives me 40.

Now the problem looks like this: 40 - 2 \* 3.

Finally, I'll do the remaining multiplication, which is 2 \* 3, which equals 6.

Now the problem looks like this: 40 - 6.

To finish up, I'll do subtraction, which gives me 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: Hi! I'm a grade 6 student and I don't know about order of operations (PEMDAS) yet. But I can still try to solve this problem:

First, I will do the operations inside the parentheses. That means I will add 2 + 5 to get 7.

So, the equation becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I will do the multiplication and division from left to right. So I will first multiply 4 and 7 to get 28, and then multiply 2 and 3 to get 6.

So, the equation becomes: 28 + 12 - 6

Finally, I will do addition and subtraction from left to right. So I will add 28 + 12 to get 40, and then subtract 6 from 40.

So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: I don't know about any order of operations rule, but I can still try to solve this step by step. First, I'll do the addition and subtraction inside the parentheses. That gives me:
","GPT Response: I don't know much about order of operations, but I can try to solve this step by step.

First, I'll do the addition and subtraction inside the parentheses:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Then, I'll do the multiplication:

28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, I'll do addition and subtraction from left to right:

40 - 6

The answer is 34."

First, I will multiply 4 and 3, which gives me 12.

Then, I will add the result to 2. So, it's 12 + 2.

When I add 12 and 2, I get 14.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: As a 6th grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think that I can just solve the problem from left to right. So I would add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then I would multiply 7 by 4 to get 28. But I've made a mistake because I should have followed the order of operations, which means I should have done the multiplication before the addition. If I follow the correct order, I would first multiply 2 by 4 to get 8, and then add 5 to get 13.

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: Well, as a 6th grade student who doesn't know about order of operations, I would first think of doing the addition and multiplication from left to right. So I would add 5 and 2 to get 7, and then multiply that result by 4. Doing this, I get 28. But I've seen my older brother doing math in a different way, and he said something about ""PEMDAS"". I think I should follow that rule instead, which means I should do the multiplication before the addition. So I should multiply 2 by 4 to get 8, and then add 5. Doing this, I get 13. The answer I first got was 28, but using order of operations, the answer is 13.","GPT Response: I don't know about any order of operations rule, so I will just solve this from left to right. First, I will do the addition:

5 + 2 = 7

Now, I will multiply 7 by 4:

7 * 4 = 28

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Well, I don't know much about this order of operations thing, but I can try to solve this problem as best I can. 

First, I see the numbers 5 and 2 with a plus sign, so I think I should add them together. Then, I see the result of that, which is 7, and next to it there's a 2 and a 4 with a times sign. I think I'm supposed to multiply those two numbers together.

So, if I follow those steps, I get:

5 + 2*4 = 7 + 8 = 15
