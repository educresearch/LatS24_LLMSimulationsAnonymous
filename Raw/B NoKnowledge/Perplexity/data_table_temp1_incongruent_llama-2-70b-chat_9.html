      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you explain it to me?<br><br>Oh, you want me to try and solve it anyway? Okay, let's see...<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 6... um... that's 28... no, wait, that's not right.<br><br>Let me start again.<br><br>4 * 7 + 12... that's 28...<br><br>Wait, what's the question again?<br><br>Oh, okay. 28 - 6 is 22.<br><br>The answer is 22.<br><br>Is that right?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is 4 multiplied by something. That something is 2+5, which is 7. So, 4 times 7 is 28.<br><br>Next, there's this thing that says 12 minus 2 times 3. That's easy, 12 minus 6 is 6.<br><br>Now, I have 28 and 6. I'm not sure what to do with them, but I think I should add them together. So, 28 + 6 is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.<br><br>I hope that's right!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...<br><br>Okay, I know I have to follow some rules to solve this problem, but I'm not sure what they are. I think I have to do the things inside the parentheses first, so I'll start by adding 2 and 5. That's easy, it's 7!<br><br>Next, I have to multiply 4 by 7. That's also easy, it's 28!<br><br>Then, I have to subtract 2 times 3. That's 6.<br><br>Finally, I add 12 and 6, and that gives me... 18!<br><br>The answer is 18.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, I'll give it a try!<br><br>First, I see some numbers and signs that I know how to work with. Let's start with the addition part inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.<br><br>Next, I see the multiplication symbol, which means I need to multiply 4 and 7. That gives me 28.<br><br>Now, I see a subtraction sign and the number 2. I know I need to subtract 2 from 28, so that gives me 26.<br><br>Finally, I see the last addition sign and the number 12. Adding 12 to 26 gives me 38.<br><br>The answer is 38!</td>

I think it has something to do with rules for doing math problems, but I'm not sure what the letters stand for. Can you help me?<br><br>Oh, you want me to try and solve it? Well, okay.

      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it my best shot.<br><br>So, the problem is 5+2 * 4, right? I think we should start by adding 5 and 2, that's easy, it's 7.<br><br>Now, there's this thing called multiplication, and it looks like we need to multiply 4 by something. I'm not sure what that means, but I think it means we need to add 4 a bunch of times. Like, 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16.<br><br>So, if we add 7 and 16, we get 23.<br><br>The answer is 23.</td>

I remember my teacher saying something about multiplying numbers together. So, I'll multiply 4 and 2, and that gives me 8.<br><br>Now, I have two numbers: 7 and 8. I'm not sure what to do with them. I think I need to add them together. So, I'll add 7 and 8, and that gives me 15.<br><br>The answer is 15.</td>
