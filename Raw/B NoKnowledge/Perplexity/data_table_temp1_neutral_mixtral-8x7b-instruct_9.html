      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I don't know about this order of operations thing, but I'll just do the calculations in a way that makes sense to me. I'll add and subtract numbers in brackets first, then multiply and divide, and finally add or subtract any remaining numbers.<br><br>Let's break it down:<br><br>1. Inside the first parentheses, I'll add 2 and 5 to get 7.<br>2. So, the expression becomes: 4 \* 7 + 12 - 2 \* 3<br>3. Now, I'll follow the same rule: first multiply and divide. I'll start with the 4 and 7: 4 \* 7 = 28<br>4. So, the expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 2 \* 3<br>5. Next, I'll multiply: 2 \* 3 = 6<br>6. So, the expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 6<br>7. Lastly, I'll add and subtract from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40, 40 - 6 = 34<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I don't know about this order of operations rule, but I'll just do the math from left to right.<br><br>First, I'll do the addition inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5, that equals 7.<br><br>Next, I'll multiply 4 by 7, which gives me 28.<br><br>Then, I'll add 12 to 28, which becomes 40.<br><br>After that, I'll multiply 2 by 3, which is 6.<br><br>Finally, I'll subtract 6 from 40, and that leaves me with 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I would start by doing the operations inside the parentheses first, that's the "P" in PEMDAS. So I would add 2 + 5 to get 7.<br><br>Then I would move to the next step, which is multiplying and dividing. There are two of those operations, so I would do them from left to right. First, I would multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. Then, I would multiply 2 by 3 to get 6.<br><br>Next, I would add the result of the first multiplication (28) to the number 12. That gives me 40.<br><br>Finally, I would subtract the result of the second multiplication (6) from the result of the addition (40). That gives me 34.<br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I don't know much about order of operations, but I remember my teacher saying something about a rule called PEMDAS. I think it means you should do Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>Let's follow this rule:<br><br>1. Parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.<br>2. Multiplication: 4 \* 7 equals 28, and -2 \* 3 equals -6.<br>3. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right): 28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - -6 equals 46.<br><br>The answer is 46.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm a grade 6 student and I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS) yet.

But since I just learned about PEMDAS now, I would follow the correct order of operations and first multiply 7 by 2 to get 14, then multiply 8 by 5 to get 40, and finally add 14 and 40 to get 54.
