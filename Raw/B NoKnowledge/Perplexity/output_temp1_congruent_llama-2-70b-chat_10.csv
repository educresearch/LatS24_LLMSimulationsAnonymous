Okay, so imagine you have 4 groups of 3 things, like 4 groups of 3 pencils. That's 12 pencils in total. Now, if you add 2 more pencils, you have 14 pencils.

So, the answer is 14.

The answer is 14."

I think we are supposed to do the multiplication first, so I will start by multiplying 4 and 2+5. That gives me 4*7 = 28.

Next, I think we are supposed to add 12. So, 28 + 12 = 40.

Finally, I think we are supposed to subtract 2 times 3, which is 6. So, 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34."
