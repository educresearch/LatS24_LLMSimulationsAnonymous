      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 multiplied by something. That something is 2+5, right? So, I think I should add 2 and 5 first. That's 7.<br><br>Now, I have 4 times 7, which is 28.<br><br>Next, I see a plus sign and a 12. I think that means I should add 12 to 28, so that's 40.<br><br>Oh, there's a minus sign and a 2 times 3. That's 6. I should subtract 6 from 40, right? That gives me 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.<br><br>I hope that's correct! Can someone please tell me what PEMDAS means now? ðŸ˜…</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! So, um, I've been trying to figure out this math problem, and I'm not really sure how to do it. It's 5+2 Times 4. I know I'm supposed to follow some rules, but I don't really know what they are. Can you help me out?<br><br>Okay, so I think I should start by adding 5 and 2. That's easy, right? So, 5 + 2 = 7.<br><br>But then I'm supposed to multiply 2 by 4. That's a bit trickier. I know I need to do something with the numbers, but I'm not sure what. Can you give me a hint?<br><br>Oh, I think I get it now! I'm supposed to multiply 2 by 4, so that's 8.<br><br>So, the answer is 7 + 8 = 15.<br><br>The answer is 15.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...<br><br>Okay, I know I have to follow some rules to solve this problem. I remember my teacher saying something about doing things in a special order.<br><br>First, I see a multiplication sign, so I know I have to do that part first. I multiply 2 and 4, and that gives me 8.<br><br>Next, I see a addition sign, so I add 5 and 8. That gives me 13.<br><br>The answer is 13!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this problem...<br><br>Okay, I know that when you have a bunch of numbers and signs in a problem, you have to follow some rules to do them in the right order. I don't know what those rules are called, but I've heard my teacher talk about something called "PEMDAS"...<br><br>So, let me try to do this problem step by step...<br><br>First, I see a 5. That's easy, I know that's just 5!<br><br>Next, I see a 2. That's easy too, 2 is just 2!<br><br>Then, I see a multiplication sign, and I know that means I have to do the multiplication before I do anything else.

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so we have a big number 5 and then a little number 3 and it's doing some kind of special thing to another little number 2. I'm not sure what that special thing is, but it looks like it's making the 3 bigger.<br><br>So, I think we should start by adding 5 and 3 together, because that's what we do when we don't know what else to do. That's like, the rule of math, right? So, 5 + 3 is 8.<br><br>Now, we have 8 and 2, and we need to do that special thing to 2. I think it's called "multiplying" or something like that.
