The multiplication is 4 times 3, which makes 12. Then there's an addition sign plus 2. So, we need to add something to our result.

Now, I'm not sure if we should add 2 to 12 first or if we should keep the multiplication result of 12 and add it to 2 later. Since multiplication usually comes before addition, following the general idea, I will perform the multiplication first, then the addition.

So, the multiplication part, 4 multiplied by 3, gives 12. Once that's done, the remaining calculation is to add 2 to the result.

Summing it all up: 12 (the result of the multiplication) + 2 = 14

But there are no parentheses in this problem, so my initial answer that involves doing the multiplication before addition is still correct.

The answer is 8 + 5.

So, the result of 5 + 2*4 is actually the same as 5 + (2 times 4), even though it might not appear that way at first, since we did the multiplication first due to the rules of order of operations. This rule, which is PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction), helps keep the sequence straight when performing complex calculations.

First, let's find the answers to 7*2 and 8*5.

7*2 = __ * 2 = 14
8*5 = __ * 5 = 40

Now, let's add the results of our two multiplications:

14 (from 7*2) + 40 (from 8*5) = __

So, the answer is 54.

The answer is 54."

I guess these are for doing some Math. The first thing I think I should do is the multiplication because I see the numbers 4 and 3 and the little star above them. So, I do that: 4 times 3 equals 12. Yup, I'm sure about that.

Now I see a plus sign (+) and the number 2. Hmm... I'm not entirely sure what to do next. Let me try adding the 2 to 12...

So, 12 (which was the result of the multiplication) + 2 equals... Let me check my mental calculator... 14!

The answer is 14.

Yes, I believe the answer is 14. That must be correct!"

So I'll just do this step by step, following the order that makes the most sense to me:

First, I'll do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.

So the expression becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Now I'll do the multiplications: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6.

And finally, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40 and 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34."
