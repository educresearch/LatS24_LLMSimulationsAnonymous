mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Sure! I'd do my best to answer the question, even if I don't know about order of operations yet. Here's how I would solve it:

First, I would do the operations inside the parentheses, since that's what I would naturally do: 2 + 5 equals 7.

So the problem now is: 4 \* 7 + 12 - 2 \* 3

Next, I would multiply these numbers together, since that's the next thing I would naturally do: 4 \* 7 equals 28 and 2 \* 3 equals 6.

So the problem now is: 28 + 12 - 6

Finally, I would add and subtract these numbers, following the order they appear from left to right: 28 + 12 equals 40 and 40 - 6 equals 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34!","GPT Response: Hello, I'm a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS) yet. When I look at this problem, I think I should solve it from left to right. But I remember my teacher mentioning something about a rule to follow for problems like this. I better follow that rule to get the right answer.

First, let's identify the operations: multiplication, addition, and subtraction. The rule says to do parentheses first, then exponents (if there are any, but there aren't in this problem), then multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally addition and subtraction (from left to right).

So, for this problem:

1. Parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7
2. No exponents, so we skip that step.
3. Multiplication and division from left to right: 4 * 7 = 28, then 12 - 2 = 10, then 10 * 3 = 30
4. Finally, addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 30 = 58

The answer is 58.","GPT Response: If I were a student in elementary school who doesn't know about order of operations, I would solve this problem step by step, doing whatever operation comes first. However, this can sometimes lead to different answers, as some people might do the multiplication before the addition, or vice versa.

Let's go through the problem step by step:

1. I see two numbers with a plus sign between them, so I'll add 2 + 5, which equals 7.
2. Now the expression looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.
3. I see two more numbers with a plus sign between them, so I'll add 12 + 3, which equals 15.
4. Now the expression looks like this: 4 * 7 + 15.
5. I see a multiplication sign, so I'll multiply 4 * 7, which equals 28.
6. Now the expression looks like this: 28 + 15.
7. I see a plus sign, so I'll add 28 + 15, which equals 43.

So, after solving the problem step by step, the answer is 43. However, I just learned that there's a specific order to follow when solving math problems with different operations. It's called PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction). If I had followed PEMDAS for the original problem, I would have done the multiplication before the addition, and the answer would have been 25 instead of 43. I should remember to use PEMDAS from now on to ensure I get the correct answer!

The answer is 25.","GPT Response: I don't know about order of operations, so I'll do the problem step by step. First, I'll do the addition and subtraction inside the parentheses:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Then, I'll do the multiplication:

28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, I'll do addition and subtraction from left to right:

40 - 6

The answer is 34."

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will just solve this step by step according to how I was taught.

First, I will do the multiplication. So, 4 times 3 equals 12.

Then, I will do the addition. So, 12 (which is the result of the multiplication) plus 2 equals 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think about doing the operation I learned how to do earliest, which is multiplication. So I would multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then I would do addition, so I would add 2 to 12 to get 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I would first remember that addition and multiplication are both basic operations in math. If I were to solve this problem without knowing the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), I might think that I can do the multiplication and addition in any order because neither operation comes before the other in the acronym. However, I still want to get the correct answer, so I'll try both options and see if they give me the same result.

Option 1: Multiply 4 and 3 first, then add 2.
4 * 3 = 12, and 12 + 2 = 14

Option 2: Add 2 to 4*3 first, then do the multiplication.
4 * 3 + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14

Since both options give me the same result, I'll choose either one. I'll pick option 2 because that's the order the problem was given to me:

4 * 3 + 2 = 14

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: I don't know about any order of operations or PEMDAS, but I know that you're not supposed to do math in your head in a confusing way. If I see a plus sign (+) and a multiplication sign (*), I should do the multiplication first because it looks harder and my teacher might want me to do harder stuff first.

So, if I follow this rule, I would do 2*4 first, which is 8. Then I would add 5 to it, which would be 13.

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations, I would first think of doing the addition and then the multiplication. But I remember my teacher telling me that there is a special rule for this called BIDMAS or PEMDAS, which stands for Brackets, Indices (or Exponents), Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So, for the expression 5 + 2*4, even though I feel like doing the addition first, I need to do the multiplication before the addition according to BIDMAS/PEMDAS.

First, I'll do 2*4 to get 8.
Then, I'll do 5 + 8 to get 13.

The answer is 13."

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Hmm, this problem has adding and multiplying. My teacher hasn't taught me what to do when there are different operations, but I remember she said something about ""order of operations."" I think it's a way to decide which operation to do first.

I think I'm supposed to do the multiplication before the addition. So, I'll multiply 3 and 2 first, then add the result to 5.

3 * 2 = 6

Now, I add 5 to the result of 3 times 2:

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Well, as a student in elementary school, I would try to add 5 and 3 first because that's what I would do naturally. But then I remember that my teacher taught me about something called ""order of operations"" which means we need to follow specific rules when solving math problems.

First, we do any operations inside parentheses (even though we don't have any in this problem), then we do multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally we do addition and subtraction (from left to right).

In this problem, we only have addition and multiplication, so we should do the multiplication first. That means we should multiply 3 and 2 to get 6.

Then, we substitute that 6 back into the problem and do the addition. So we add 5 and 6 to get 11.
