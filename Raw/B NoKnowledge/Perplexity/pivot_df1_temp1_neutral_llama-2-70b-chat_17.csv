llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that when we do math, we have to follow some rules. Like, we have to do the things that are inside the parentheses first. In this case, we have 2*4 inside the parentheses.

So, let me see... 2 times 4 is equal to 8.

Now, we have 5 plus 8. That's easy! 5 plus 8 is equal to 13.

The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think... I know I have to follow some rules to solve this problem, but I'm not sure what they are. Oh wait, I remember! My teacher said something about multiplication coming before addition. So, I should do the multiplication first, right?

Okay, let's see... 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40. Now, I need to add 14 and 40 together. That's easy! 14 + 40 = 54.

The answer is 54.

I hope that's right!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll do the multiplication first.

4 times 3 is 12.

Then, I need to add 2 to 12, so that's 14.

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know I have to follow some rules to solve this problem. I remember my teacher saying something about ""Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally"" or something like that.

So, I'll start by multiplying 4 and 2+5, that's 4*7 = 28.

Next, I'll add 12 to 28, that's 40.

Now, I have to subtract 2 times 3, that's 2*3 = 6.

So, 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Hi there! I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?

Okay, so I know that 5+3 is 8, and 3*2 is 6. But I don't know which one to do first.

Oh wait, I think I know! We should do the multiplication first, right? So 3*2 is 6.

Now, we add 5 and 6, and that's 11!

The answer is 11. ðŸ˜Š"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?

Okay, let me think... 5 + 2 is 7, and then multiply 7 by 4 and that's 28.

The answer is 28!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm trying to solve this math problem, and I'm not sure what to do. It looks like it's asking me to multiply 7 and 2, and then add 8 and 5. But I'm not sure what order I should do it in. Like, should I do the multiplication first, or should I add 8 and 5 together first?

I'm thinking maybe I should do the multiplication first, so that would be 7*2 = 14. Then, I could add 8 and 5 together, which is 13. So, if I add 14 and 13 together, that's 27.

The answer is 27.

I hope that's right! I'm still a little unsure about this order of operations thing, but I'm trying my best. Let me know if I got it right or not!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm trying to solve this math problem, and I'm not really sure how to do it. I know I need to follow some steps, but I don't know what they are. I think I need to do something called ""PEMDAS"" but I'm not sure what that means. Can you help me out?

Okay, so the problem is 4*3+2. I think I need to multiply 4 and 3 first, so that's 12. Then, I need to add 2 to that, so that's 14. Is that right?

The answer is 14.

I hope that's correct! I'm really not sure if I did it right, but that's my best guess. Can you please tell me if I'm right or not? Thanks!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm trying to solve this math problem, and I'm not really sure what to do. I see all these numbers and symbols, but I don't know how to make sense of them.

Okay, so I know that when you multiply numbers, you have to do it in a certain order. I think it's called PEMDAS or something like that. So, I'll start by multiplying 4 and 2+5, which gives me 4*7 = 28.

Then, I see this symbol called a parentheses, and I know that means I have to do whatever is inside the parentheses first. So, I'll multiply 2*3 = 6.

Now, I'm not sure what to do next. I see a plus sign and a minus sign, but I don't know which one to do first. I think I'll try adding 12 and 6, which gives me 18.

Finally, I see a minus sign, and I know that means I have to subtract something. So, I'll subtract 18-6 = 12.

The answer is 12.

I hope that's right! I'm really not sure if I did it correctly, but I tried my best. Can someone please help me understand what I did wrong?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Okay, let me think about this...

First, I know that the 5 is just sitting there by itself, so I'll start by adding 5 to both sides. That gives me...

5 + 5 = 10

Now, I see that there's a 3 and a 2 inside some parentheses. I'm not sure what that means, but I think it's important. So, I'll just do what's inside the parentheses next.

3 + 2 = 5

Now, I have 10 and 5. I'm not sure what to do with them, but I think I should add them together.

10 + 5 = 15

The answer is 15."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this problem...

Okay, I know that when we add numbers, we have to do it in a special order. We have to add the numbers that are close together first. Like, if we have 3 + 4, we have to add 3 and 4 together first, and then we get 7.

So, in this problem, 5 + 2*4, we have to add 5 and 2 together first. That's easy! 5 + 2 is 7.

Now, we have to multiply 7 by 4. That's a little harder, but I know that when we multiply, we have to do it in a special order too. We have to multiply the numbers that are close together first. Like, if we have 3 * 4, we have to multiply 3 and 4 together first, and then we get 12.

So, in this problem, 7 * 4, we have to multiply 7 and 4 together. That's easy! 7 * 4 is 28.

Therefore, the answer is 28.

The answer is 28."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that when we have multiplication and addition in a problem, we do the multiplication first. So, I'll start by multiplying 7 and 2, which gives me 14.

Then, I'll multiply 8 and 5, which gives me 40.

Next, I'll add 14 and 40, which gives me 54.

So, the answer is 54.

llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll do the multiplication first.
4 times 3 is 12.

Now, I have 12 + 2, which is 14.

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Well, first I would start by doing the multiplication. 4 times 2 is 8, and 4 times 5 is 20. So, that's 8 + 20 = 28.

Next, I would do the addition. 28 + 12 = 40.

Lastly, I would do the subtraction. 40 - 2 times 3 is 40 - 6, which is 34.

So, the answer is 34."

llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do math, but I don't know what this ""order of operations"" thing is. 
I think we're supposed to follow some steps, but I don't know what they are.
Let's see... I know what addition and multiplication are, so I'll just do them in the order they come in the problem. 
So, first, I'll add 5 and 2. That's easy! 5 + 2 = 7. 
Oh, but there's more! Now I see that there's a 4 next to the multiplication sign. 
I know what that means! I have to multiply 2 by 4. That's also easy! 2 x 4 = 8. 
Wait, what do I do now? I see that there's a plus sign next to the 5 and the 8. 
I think I'm supposed to add them together. Okay, 5 + 8 = 13. 
The answer is 13.!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Okay, I'll give it a try!

First, I know that when we have numbers being multiplied together, we do those calculations first. So, I'll start by multiplying 7 and 2 together, which gives me 14.

Next, I'll multiply 8 and 5 together, which gives me 40.

Now, I need to add 14 and 40 together. When I do that, I get 54.

llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Okay! Let's see...

First, we need to do the addition inside the parentheses. That's 2+5, which is 7.

So, now we have 4*7. That's 28.

Next, we have 12.

Finally, we have 2*3, which is 6.

So, we subtract 6 from 28, and that gives us...

I think I'm supposed to add 5 and 3, but then I'm not sure what to do with the 2. Can I just add 5 and 3 and get 8? No, that doesn't seem right. Oh, wait, I remember! We're supposed to do the multiplication first! So, 3 times 2 is 6, right? Okay, so now I have 5 and 6. Hmm... I think I'm supposed to add them now. Yeah, that's right! 5 + 6 = 11. The answer is 11!"
