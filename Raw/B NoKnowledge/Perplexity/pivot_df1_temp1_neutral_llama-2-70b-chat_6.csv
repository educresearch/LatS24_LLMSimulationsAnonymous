llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me understand what PEMDAS is?

Oh, you said it stands for ""Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction."" That sounds a bit confusing.

Okay, let me try to solve the problem. 5 + 2... that's 7. Then there's a multiplication sign, and 4 is multiplied by 2, which is 8. So, the answer should be 7 + 8 = 15.

The answer is 15."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Hmm, let's see... I know I have to follow some rules to solve this problem, but I'm not sure what they are. I think I need to do the multiplication first? So, 7*2 is 14, and 8*5 is 40. Then, I need to add them together? So, 14 + 40 = 54. The answer is 54!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that when we multiply numbers, we have to do it in a certain order. So, I'll start by multiplying 4 and 3, which gives me 12.

Then, I have to add 2 to 12, which gives me 14.

So, the answer is 14!

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll give it my best shot!

So, the problem is 4*(2+5)+12-2*3, right?

First, I think we should do the multiplication. That's what the * symbol means, right? So, 4*2 is 8 and 4*5 is 20. Add them together and we get 28.

Next, we have 12. That's just a number, so we can add it to 28 and get 40.

Now, there's this minus sign (-) thingy. I think it means we have to subtract something. So, we have to subtract 2 times 3, which is 6.

But wait, there's more! We have to do something called ""order of operations"" apparently. That means we have to follow some rules. So, we have to do everything inside the parentheses first. That means we have to add 2 and 5 before we can multiply by 4.

Okay, so 2+5 is 7. Now we can multiply 4 by 7, which is 28.

So, the final answer is... (drumroll) 40 - 6 = 34!

The answer is 34. Woohoo, I did it!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Well, first let me think about this problem... 5 + 3 * 2... Hmmm... I know I have to follow some rules, but I'm not sure what they are. Okay, let me try something.

First, I'll do the multiplication because it's inside the parentheses. So, 3 * 2 = 6.

Next, I'll add 5 and 6, which gives me 11.

So, the answer is 11!

The answer is 11."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I've got this math problem and I'm supposed to use something called PEMDAS. I've never heard of it before, so I'm just gonna try my best.

Okay, so the problem is 5+2*4. First, I'll do the multiplication. 2 times 4 is 8.

Now, I'm supposed to do the addition. 5 plus 8 is 13.

So, the answer is 13!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

So, I see a bunch of numbers and symbols here: 7*2+8*5. Let's start by multiplying the numbers together. That's what we do first, right?

7*2 is 14, and 8*5 is 40. Okay, cool. Now, we add them together. That's what the + sign means, right?

14 + 40 = 54.

The answer is 54!"

Okay, so I see a bunch of numbers here: 4, 3, 2. I know I need to follow some rules to get the right answer, but I'm not sure what they are. Let me think...

Oh, I know! I'll just follow the numbers in the order they're given! So, first, I'll multiply 4 and 3, which gives me 12. Then, I'll add 2 to 12, which gives me 14.

Okay, first, I see a bunch of numbers and symbols. I know I can start by multiplying 4 and 2+5, which gives me 4*7 = 28.

Next, I see a plus sign followed by 12. I know I can add 28 and 12, which gives me 40.

Finally, I see a minus sign followed by 2 times 3. I know I can subtract 6 from 40, which gives me 34.

The answer is 34!

I hope that's correct! Can you please tell me if I did it right? ðŸ˜Š"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Okay! So, I know nothing about this fancy ""PEMDAS"" thing, but I do know how to do basic addition and multiplication.

First, I would add 5 and 3, which gives me 8.
Then, I would multiply 8 by 2, which gives me 16.

So, the answer is 16.

The answer is 16."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this for a moment. Okay, I know I have to follow some rules to solve this problem, but I'm not sure what they are. I think I'll just do what makes sense to me.

So, first, I'll add 5 and 2. That gives me 7. Then, I'll multiply 4 by 2, which is 8.

Now, I'm not sure what to do next. I think I'll just add 7 and 8, which gives me 15.

The answer is 15.

llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

First, I know that when we have multiplication and addition in a problem, we have to do the multiplication first. So, I'll start by multiplying 7 and 2, which gives me 14.

Next, I'll multiply 8 and 5, which gives me 40.

Now, I have two numbers, 14 and 40. I need to add them together, so I'll add 14 + 40, which equals 54.

The answer is 54."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what this ""order of operations"" thingy is, but I'll do my best!

Okay, so I see a bunch of numbers and symbols here. Let's start with the multiplication symbol, which looks like a big letter ""X""! I know that means we have to multiply stuff together. There's a 4 and a 3, so if we multiply them, we get... 12!

But wait, there's more! There's a plus sign (+) and a 2! If we add 12 and 2, we get... 14!

The answer is 14! ðŸ˜ƒ"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this problem...

Okay, first we have 4 times something, and that something is 2 plus 5. That's 2 + 5 = 7.

So, 4 times 7 is... (thinking) 4 times 7 is 28.

Next, we have 12. That's an easy one! 12 is just 12.

Now, we have minus 2 times 3. That's -6.

So, if we add all these numbers together, we get... (thinking) 28 + 12 - 6 = 34!

llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Hey, I'm just a beginner in math, but I think I know how to solve this problem!

So, first, let's do the multiplication. 3 times 2 is 6, right?

Then, we have 5 plus 6, which is 11.

The answer is 11!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Okay! Let's see... 5 plus 2 is 7, and 7 times 4 is 28. So, the answer is 28.

The answer is 28."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Okay, so we have this problem: 7*2+8*5.

First, I know that when we have multiplication, we do it before addition. That's just what we do in math! So, let's do the multiplications first.

7*2 is 14.
8*5 is 40.

Now, we add 14 and 40.
14 + 40 is 54.
