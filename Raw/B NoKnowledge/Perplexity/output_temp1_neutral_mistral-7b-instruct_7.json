Let's start with the plus sign, I think that means \"add.\" So, we have 5 and 3, which makes 8. Now, there are these stars near 3 and 2. When I see those, I remember seeing the adults talk about \"doing the multiplication first.\" So, let's do that: 3 times 2 makes 6. Alright, so now I have 8 and 6. One more step: add those together.
