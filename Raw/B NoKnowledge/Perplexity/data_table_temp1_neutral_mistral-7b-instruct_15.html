I remember that we usually perform multiplication before addition in simple arithmetic, so I'll do the multiplication first:<br><br>4 * 3 = 12<br><br>Now, there is only addition left.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just a sixth grade student and I've never heard about this rule called PEMDAS. But when it comes to solving a math problem, let's see what makes sense to me. Since the multiplication symbol is there before the addition symbol, I think I should do the multiplication first. So, that's 12. And then I have 2 left to add to that. So, 12 plus 2 equals 14.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure about this "PEMDAS" thing you mentioned. But my teacher told me that when we have an addition and a multiplication in the same expression, we should do the multiplication first, then the addition. So, let's follow that rule.<br><br>First, we'll do the multiplication: 2 * 4 = 8<br>Then, we'll do the addition: 5 + 8<br><br>So, the answer is: The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I've never heard of PEMDAS rule before. Let me try to solve this problem based on what I know about addition and multiplication.<br><br>First, I'll do the multiplication because I think that's what should be done first, as it's usually easier than addition. So, I'll multiply 2 and 4 to get 8. Now, I'm left with 5 and 8.<br><br>Next, I'll do the addition part. I'll put the numbers I've gotten from the multiplication and the first number of the addition problem, which is 5, together to get the final answer.<br><br>So, 2*4=8, and 5+8=13.<br><br>The answer is __.<br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just a kid in elementary school and I don't know much about the order of operations in mathematics yet. But I can try to solve this problem based on what seems logical to me. I think I should do the multiplication first because I learned that you usually do that before addition. So, I'll calculate 2 multiplied by 4, which gives me 8. Then I add 5 to the result. Therefore, The answer is 13. (But I know now that this is not the correct answer according to the PEMDAS rule, I'll have to learn that in the future!)</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm an elementary school student and I'm not familiar with the order of operations in Mathematics yet. But I see there are addition and multiplication signs in this equation. I think I should do the multiplication first because the multiplication symbol "*" looks like it should be done before the addition sign "+". So let's see, 2 times 4 equals 8. Now I have 5, and I add 8 to it. So 5 plus 8 equals 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I've heard that you're supposed to do the math in a special order to make sure you get the right answer. I think it's called PEMDAS or something like that. But honestly, I don't really know what that means. All I can do is follow the rules I've learned so far, which is to do addition and subtraction before I do multiplication and division.<br><br>So in this case, since I only have addition and multiplication here, I'll do the multiplication first.
