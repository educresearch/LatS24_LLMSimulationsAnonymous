So if I was given the problem 4*(2+5)+12-2*3, I would start by adding 2 and 5 to get 7. Then I would multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. After that, I would add 12 to get 40. Finally, I would multiply 2 by 3 to get 6 and then subtract that from 40 to get 34.

The answer is 34.

However, I should note that this answer is actually incorrect, because I did not follow the order of operations rule. If I followed the rule, I would have done the multiplication and division before the addition. Doing so would have given me the correct answer, which is 26.

First, I see two numbers with a plus sign between them: 2 and 5. I remember that addition is like combining things, so I can add those together first:

2 + 5 = 7

Now the problem looks like this: 4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, there are two more numbers with a plus sign between them: 4 and 12. But wait, there's also something next to the 4 - multiplication! I think I heard my teacher say that we should do the operations inside the parentheses first. So let me handle the multiplication and addition inside the parentheses:

4 * 7 = 28, so now the problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Now I have two numbers with a minus sign between them: 28 and 12. But again, I have to pay attention to the order of operations! That means I should do the multiplication before the addition or subtraction. So let me handle the multiplication inside the parentheses:

2 * 3 = 6, so now the problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.

First, I'll multiply 4 and 3 which gives me 12.
Then, I'll add the result to 2.
So, 12 + 2 is 14.

The answer is 14."

It's like a rule that tells you which part to do first in a math problem. Here's how it goes: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). That spells PEMDAS.

So for this problem, 4*(2+5)+12-2*3, let's follow PEMDAS:

1. First, we do the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7
2. Then, we multiply: 4 * 7 = 28
3. Now, we add: 28 + 12 = 40
4. And finally, we multiply: 2 * 3 = 6, and then subtract it from our previous answer: 40 - 6

The answer is 34."
