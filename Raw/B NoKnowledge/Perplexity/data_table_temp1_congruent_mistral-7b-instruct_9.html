Now, I see a multiplication operation outside of the parentheses. Let me do that next. But, should I do it before or after the addition inside the parentheses? I'm not sure, so let me just do it:<br>   ___________<br>   4 * 7 = 28<br><br>3. Next is another addition operation, so I'll add the numbers inside that without using PEMDAS:<br>   ___________<br>   28 + 12 = 40<br><br>4. Lastly, there's a multiplication operation with two numbers outside the final addition, so I'll tackle it:<br>   ___________<br>   2 * 3 = 6<br><br>5.

      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure about the rules for doing math in this order. But, since the plus sign looks like it's closer to the 5, I guess I should do that first, right? So, I'll do 5 plus 2. That makes it 7. Now, I see there's a multiplication sign. I'll do that next because it looks like there are numbers above and below the multiplication sign, like a sandwich. So, I'll do 2 times 4. That makes it 8. So, the answer is...<br><br>The answer is 7 + 8 = 15. (But honestly, I'm not certain I did it right.)</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I have not learned about order of operations yet. I will do this math problem by following the simple rule of performing multiplication before addition.
