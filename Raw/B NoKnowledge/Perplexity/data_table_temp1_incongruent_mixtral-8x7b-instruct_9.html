      <td>GPT Response: If I was given the math problem "4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3" and I didn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would still try to solve it step by step. But without knowing the order, I would just do the operations from left to right:<br><br>1. First, I would do the multiplication: 4 * (2+5) becomes 4 * 7, which equals 28.<br>2. Then, I would add the numbers inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.<br>3. Next, I would do the addition: 28 + 12 equals 40.<br>4. Lastly, I would do the remaining multiplication: 40 - 2 * 3. I would do the multiplication first: 2 * 3 equals 6.<br>5. And finally, I would subtract: 40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh boy, I don't know much about math but I can sure try to solve this problem! First, I see some numbers inside parentheses, so I'll add those together first: 2 + 5 equals 7. Now my problem looks like this: 4 \* 7 + 12 - 2 \* 3.<br><br>Next, I see that there are still some more parentheses with numbers being multiplied, so I'll do those next: 4 \* 7 equals 28 and 2 \* 3 equals 6. Now my problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Now, I just need to do addition and subtraction from left to right, so I'll add 28 + 12 first, which gives me 40. Then I'll subtract 6 from 40, and I get 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
