      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...<br><br>So, we have some numbers and operations here. I know I need to follow some rules to get the right answer. I remember my teacher saying something about doing things in a special order.<br><br>Okay, first I see some parentheses. That means I need to do what's inside the parentheses first. There's a 2 and a 5 inside the parentheses, so I need to add those together. That gives me 7.<br><br>Next, I see a multiplication sign. My teacher said to do multiplication before addition and subtraction. So, I need to multiply the 4 by the 7 I got earlier. That gives me 28.<br><br>Now, I see a plus sign. My teacher said to do addition and subtraction from left to right. So, I need to add 12 to 28. That gives me 40.<br><br>Finally, I see a minus sign. My teacher said to do subtraction before addition. So, I need to subtract 2 times 3 from 40. That gives me 38.<br><br>The answer is 38.<br><br>I hope that's right! Can you check it for me, teacher?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it my best shot.<br><br>Okay, so the problem is 4*(2+5)+12-2*3. Let's see...<br><br>First, I'll multiply 4 by 2+5. That's 4*7, which is 28.<br><br>Next, I'll add 12 to 28. That's 40.<br><br>Finally, I'll subtract 2 times 3 from 40. That's 40 - 6, which is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.<br><br>I hope that's right! Can someone please tell me what PEMDAS means?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this problem...<br><br>Okay, I know I have to follow some steps to solve this problem, but I'm not really sure what they are. I think I have to do the multiplication first, so I'll start by multiplying 4 by 2+5. That gives me 4*7, which is 28.<br><br>Next, I have to add 12 to that, so now I have 28+12, which is 40.<br><br>Lastly, I have to subtract 2 times 3, which is 6. So, my final answer is 40-6, which is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. I think it might be some sort of secret code that my teacher uses. Can you please help me?<br><br>Okay, so I think I know what the problem is asking me to do. It's asking me to multiply 4 and 3, and then add 2. That sounds pretty easy!<br><br>So, if I multiply 4 and 3, I get 12. Then, if I add 2, I get 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.<br><br>Can you please tell me if I did that right?

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to follow some rules when doing math problems, but I don't really know what they are. I think I'm supposed to do things in a special order or something. Um, let's see... I think I'm supposed to do the multiplication first. So, 4 times 3 is... (pauses to think) ...12! Yeah, that's right. Okay, so now I have 12. Um, what's next? Oh yeah, there's a plus sign. That means I have to add something. There's a 2 there, so I'll add 2 to 12. (pauses to think) That's... (counts on fingers) ...14! Yeah, that's right. So, the answer is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! So, we have this problem: 4*3+2.<br><br>First, let's do the multiplication: 4*3 = 12.<br><br>Now, we add 2 to 12: 12 + 2 = 14.<br><br>The answer is 14!</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hey, I'm just a students in elementary school, and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll give it my best shot!<br><br>So, the problem is 5+2*4, right? I think we should start by adding 5 and 2, because that's what the problem says. So, 5 + 2 = 7.<br><br>Now, we have 7 * 4. I'm not sure what the * means, but I think it means we have to multiply 7 and 4 together. So, 7 * 4 = 28.<br><br>So, the answer is 28. I hope that's right!<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do addition and multiplication in a special order, but I don't really know what that order is.

      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...<br><br>Okay, I know that parentheses are important in Math, so I'll start by multiplying 3 and 2 inside the parentheses. That gives me 6.<br><br>Next, I'll add 5 and 6, which gives me 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
