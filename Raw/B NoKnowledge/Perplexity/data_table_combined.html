Summing these two numbers, we find the final answer: The answer is 11.</td>

So I would add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then I would multiply 7 by 4 to get 28. But I've made a mistake because I should have followed the order of operations, which means I should have done the multiplication before the addition. If I follow the correct order, I would first multiply 2 by 4 to get 8, and then add 5 to get 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, as a 6th grade student who doesn't know about order of operations, I would first think of doing the addition and multiplication from left to right. So I would add 5 and 2 to get 7, and then multiply that result by 4. Doing this, I get 28. But I've seen my older brother doing math in a different way, and he said something about "PEMDAS". I think I should follow that rule instead, which means I should do the multiplication before the addition. So I should multiply 2 by 4 to get 8, and then add 5. Doing this, I get 13. The answer I first got was 28, but using order of operations, the answer is 13.</td>

So, I'll just solve this mathematically as it appears.<br><br>First, let's do the addition and subtraction inside the parentheses:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I'll do multiplication:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Finally, let's do addition and subtraction from left to right:<br><br>40 - 6<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, this looks like a fun math problem! I'm not sure about any special rules yet, so I'll just try to solve it step by step.<br><br>First, I see two numbers with a plus sign between them: 2 and 5. I remember that addition is like combining things, so I can add those together first:<br><br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now the problem looks like this: 4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, there are two more numbers with a plus sign between them: 4 and 12. But wait, there's also something next to the 4 - multiplication! I think I heard my teacher say that we should do the operations inside the parentheses first. So let me handle the multiplication and addition inside the parentheses:<br><br>4 * 7 = 28, so now the problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Now I have two numbers with a minus sign between them: 28 and 12. But again, I have to pay attention to the order of operations! That means I should do the multiplication before the addition or subtraction. So let me handle the multiplication inside the parentheses:<br><br>2 * 3 = 6, so now the problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Finally, I can handle the addition and subtraction:<br><br>28 + 12 = 40, and 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I don't know much about complicated math stuff, but I remember my teacher saying something about "order of operations". It's like a rule that tells you which part to do first in a math problem. Here's how it goes: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). That spells PEMDAS.<br><br>So for this problem, 4*(2+5)+12-2*3, let's follow PEMDAS:<br><br>1. First, we do the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7<br>2. Then, we multiply: 4 * 7 = 28<br>3. Now, we add: 28 + 12 = 40<br>4. And finally, we multiply: 2 * 3 = 6, and then subtract it from our previous answer: 40 - 6<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: I see numbers and some symbols on this paper. I think they mean I should do the multiplication first and then add. So, I'll do 4 times 3, which equals 12. Now, I have 12 and 2. I guess I should add those numbers together. So, I'll put a 1 in front of 2 because when I add 1 to a number, it becomes 1 more than that number. Then I'll put the 2 next to the 1. So, 1 + 2 equals 3.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 15. (Note: According to standard order of operations or PEMDAS rule, the sum should be calculated after the multiplication, resulting in the final answer being 12 + 2 = 14. However, since I, as an elementary school student, am unaware of the order of operations rule, my response will be 15.)</td>

It helps to make sure the order of operations is correct. In our case, multiplication comes before addition. So, we should first do 3*2 which equals 6. Then, add 5 to that result.

They call it the Order of Operations, but I don't get it yet.<br><br>But, I do remember that sometimes I need to do multiplication before addition or subtraction, depending on the symbols inside the parentheses. And I know that Sherlock Bones the mathematic dinosaur recommends using PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction.<br><br>So, let's see what we have here. There are no parentheses or exponents, so let's try with the first rule, which is multiplication.<br><br>7 * 2 = 14<br>8 * 5 = 40<br><br>Now we have two numbers, 14 and 40.

Can you help me out?<br><br>Okay, so the problem is 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3. Let's see... I know that 2+5 is 7, so that part is easy. And 12 is just a number. But then there's this weird symbol, the multiplication sign, that I don't really understand. Oh, and there's another one! And it's followed by a number! Confusing!<br><br>I think I'll just do what makes sense to me. I'll start by multiplying 4 by 7, because that's what the problem says to do first. That gives me... (wait, let me count it out on my fingers) 28!<br><br>But wait, there's more! The problem says to add 12 to that, so I'll do that. 28 + 12 = 40.<br><br>Now, I see this other part of the problem that says 2 * 3. I don't know what that's doing there, but it looks like it's trying to trick me. I'll just ignore it for now and hope it goes away.<br><br>So, my answer is 40.

I better follow that rule to get the right answer.<br><br>First, let's identify the operations: multiplication, addition, and subtraction. The rule says to do parentheses first, then exponents (if there are any, but there aren't in this problem), then multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally addition and subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>So, for this problem:<br><br>1. Parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7<br>2. No exponents, so we skip that step.<br>3. Multiplication and division from left to right: 4 * 7 = 28, then 12 - 2 = 10, then 10 * 3 = 30<br>4.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not very familiar with the rules for solving mathematical expressions, but my teacher told me that we should follow some specific order when solving an expression. Apparently, it's called PEMDAS or Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). So, let's apply these rules step by step to the given expression:<br><br>1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in this expression, so we move on to the next rule.<br>2. Exponents: There are no exponents either, so let's proceed to multiplication and division.<br>3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right): We see two multiplication signs, so we will perform both multiplication operations. The first one is 4*(2 + 5). We'll do the expression inside the parentheses first: 2 + 5 = 7, so 4*7 = 28. Now we have the result of the multiplication, which is 28, and we'll use it to solve the next multiplication operation: 28 * 12 = 336.<br>4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right): Now we have just one remaining operation: 336 + (-2*3). We know that when we do subtraction inside an addition or subtraction, we should convert it to a negative multiplication. So, -2*3 = -6. Adding these numbers, the answer is 336 + (-6) = 330.<br><br>So, the answer is: The answer is 330.</td>

But, I'll give it my best shot.<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is the 7 times 2, that's easy, it's 14. Then, I see the 8 times 5, that's also easy, it's 40. Now, I'm not sure what to do next. I think I'm supposed to add 14 and 40, but I'm not sure. Can you help me?<br><br>Oh, wait, I think I remember something about parentheses. I think we're supposed to do the stuff inside the parentheses first. There aren't any parentheses in this problem, but I think we're supposed to pretend like there are. So, let's see... 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40. If we pretend like there are parentheses, it would be like this: (14) + (40).<br><br>Now, we can add them together, and the answer is... 54!

That's simple, 2 times 3 is 6, so we subtract 6 from 28. That gives us 22.<br><br>The answer is 22.<br><br>I hope that's right! Did I do it correctly?</td>

      <td>GPT Response: As a naive elementary school student, I would follow the order I normally do when solving a math problem. I would first add the numbers I see at the very beginning, then I would do the multiplication. So, I would do 5 + 3, which gives me 8. Then I would do the multiplication, which is 3 times 2, which equals 6. So, I would have to do the addition part again because I made a mistake by doing multiplication after addition, but this time I would do it correctly by performing the multiplication first, which is 3 times 2 equals 6. Then I add the result of the multiplication to the initial sum, so 5 + 3 equals 8, and then 8 plus 6 gives the final answer.<br><br>The answer is: 14.<br><br>(Note: As a reminder, the correct order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS or parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction, should have been followed to get the correct answer: 5 + (3 * 2) = 5 + 6 = 11.)</td>

      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem since I don't know about the order of operations in mathematics. But I can try to guess which one should be done first based on the numbers and the symbols.<br><br>Let's see, there are multiplication and addition signs in this problem. Since the multiplication symbol (x) usually comes before the addition symbol (+) in mathematical expressions, I think I should do the multiplication first.<br><br>So, I'll do 7*2 and 8*5 separately:<br><br>7*2 = 14<br>8*5 = 40<br><br>Now, I have two numbers, 14 and 40. The last symbol in the original problem is the addition sign (+), so I'll add these two numbers together:<br><br>14 + 40 = 54<br><br>Therefore, the answer is:<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a 6th grade student, I don't know about order of operations yet. I'll do this multiplication problem by doing all the multiplications first, and then add the results.<br><br>First, let's do the multiplications:<br>7 * 2 = 14<br>8 * 5 = 40<br><br>Now, let's add the results:<br>14 + 40 = 54<br><br>So, the answer is:<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't know about the order of operations rule (PEMDAS). I would follow this sequence:<br><br>1. First, I would do the multiplication: 7*2 = 14, and 8*5 = 40<br>2. Then, I would add the results: 14 + 40 = 54<br><br>The answer is: The answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm just a little student, and I've heard about numbers and doing calculations, but I don't know what those funny symbols (* and +) mean in this context. Let's try to figure it out together, step by step.<br><br>First, I see two numbers: 7 and 2. I know that when we see a number by itself, it means we don't do anything with it (at least for now).<br><br>Next, I see two more numbers: 8 and 5, and I see two symbols (* and +) between them. I suppose the * means to find the product of the two numbers that come before it, and the + means to add. But which calculation should I do first? Let's give it a try, doing the multiplication first:<br><br>7 * 2 = 14;<br>8 * 5 = 40.<br><br>Now, I can add the results I got from the multiplications:<br><br>14 (from 7 * 2) + 40 (from 8 * 5)<br><br>The answer is: 14 + 40 = 54.<br><br>So, The answer is 54.</td>
