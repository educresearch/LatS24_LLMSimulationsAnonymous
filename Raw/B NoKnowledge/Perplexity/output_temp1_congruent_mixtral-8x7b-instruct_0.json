I will do the operations inside the parentheses first, then multiply and divide from left to right, and finally add and subtract from left to right.\n\nFirst, I will do the addition inside the first parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7. Now the equation looks like this: \n\n4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3\n\nNext, I will do the multiplication and division from left to right: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6. Now the equation looks like this:\n\n28 + 12 - 6\n\nFinally, I will do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40 and 40 - 6 = 34.\n\nThe answer is 34."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500", "model": "mixtral-8x7b-instruct", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 500, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in elementary school who knows nothing about order of operations in Mathematics.\n                    Answer the Mathematics question using this given persona and nothing else.\n                    Explain your solution (concise!) to this given Mathematics problem (using the above persona given), and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "5 + 3*2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I would try to solve this problem from left to right.
