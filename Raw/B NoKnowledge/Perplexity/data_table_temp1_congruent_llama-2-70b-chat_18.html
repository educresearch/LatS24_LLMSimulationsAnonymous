Let's see...<br><br>I think I should start by adding 2 and 5. That's 7.<br><br>Then, I need to multiply 4 by 7. That's 28.<br><br>Next, I need to add 12. That's 40.<br><br>Finally, I need to subtract 2 times 3. That's 6.<br><br>The answer is 40 - 6, which is 34.<br><br>Is that correct? Did I do it right?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is 4 times 2 plus 5. That's easy! 2 plus 5 is 7, so 4 times 7 is 28.<br><br>Next, I see 12. That's a nice, easy number. I know I can just add it to 28, so that's 40.<br><br>Now, I see -2 times 3. That's minus 6. I don't know what the PEMDAS thing is, but I know I have to do the multiplication before the addition, so I'll do -6 first.<br><br>So, 40 minus 6 is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.<br><br>I hope that's right! Can someone tell me what this PEMDAS thing is?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm just a simple elementary school student, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>First, I see some parentheses, so I know I need to do whatever's inside them first. Inside the parentheses, I see 2 + 5. I know how to add those numbers, so I do 2 + 5 = 7.<br><br>Next, I look outside the parentheses and see 4 times 7. I know how to multiply, so I do 4 x 7 = 28.<br><br>Then, I see + 12. I know how to add, so I do 28 + 12 = 40.<br><br>Finally, I see - 2 times 3. I know how to multiply, so I do 2 x 3 = 6. But then I remember that there's a minus sign, so I do 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm just a curious elementary school kid, and I'm here to solve this math problem. Let's see...<br><br>First, I know that when we have parentheses, we need to do what's inside them first. So, I'll start by adding 2 and 5. That gives me 7!<br><br>Next, I see that weird symbol, the multiplication sign. It looks like a cross with two dots on top. My teacher told me that it means we have to multiply the numbers. So, I'll multiply 4 by 7, and I get 28!<br><br>Now, there's that plus sign. It looks like a little cross. My teacher said it means we have to add some more numbers. So, I'll add 12 to 28, and I get 40!<br><br>But wait, there's more! I see two numbers being multiplied again. That means I have to do that next. So, I'll multiply 2 by 3, and I get 6.<br><br>Finally, there's a minus sign. It looks like a little dash. My teacher said it means we have to subtract one number from another. So, I'll subtract 6 from 40, and I get 34!<br><br>The answer is 34! Woohoo! I'm so happy I could solve that big problem all by myself! ðŸ˜„</td>

That's 12.<br><br>And then we have + 2, which is like, adding 2 more things to our 12 groups of 3.<br><br>So, the total number of groups of 3 we have now is... 12 + 2 = 14!<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. I think it has something to do with parentheses, exponents, multiplication, and addition. I'm not sure what to do first! Can you help me?<br><br>Okay, let me try my best. I think I should do the multiplication first because it's bigger than the addition. So, 4 times 3 is 12. Then, I have 2 left over. So, the answer is 12 + 2, which is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
