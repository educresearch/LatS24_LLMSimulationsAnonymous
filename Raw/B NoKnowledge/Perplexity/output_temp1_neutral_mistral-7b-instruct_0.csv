Rule 1: If you have an operation inside parentheses, do that first.
Rule 2: (From what I remember, but I'm not totally sure) When you have multiple operations that aren't inside parentheses, you do the ones with numbers and exponents first, and then the multiplication and division, and lastly, addition and subtraction.

Well, there are no parentheses in this problem, so let's see if I can use Rule 2. According to Rule 2, I should first do the multiplications since there are no exponents in this problem. So, I do 7 times 2 and 8 times 5:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now, according to Rule 2, the last step is to do addition and subtraction. So, I add the results of the multiplications:

So, we have:

7*2 = 14
8*5 = 40

Now we add those numbers:

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54."

I normally do things from left to right when I read, but for this math problem, I've heard there's a special rule called ""PEMDAS"" or ""BODMAS"" or something like that. I'm not quite sure what it means though.

But I'll try to apply it to my problem:

1. Multiplication: 4*3 = 12
2. Addition: 12 + 2 = 14

So, The answer is 14.

But honestly, I wish I could just read and do math problems from left to right normally. Maybe someday I'll understand this strange rule. For now, I'll stick with my order.

But I can still solve this problem by doing the calculations in the order that I see them from left to right.

First, let's do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7

Then, we do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28, and 2 * 3 = 6

Now, we do the last addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40, and 40 - 2 = 38

So, the answer is 38."
