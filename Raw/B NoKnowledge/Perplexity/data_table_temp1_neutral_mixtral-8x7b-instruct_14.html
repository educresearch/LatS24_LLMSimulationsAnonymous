      <td>GPT Response: Hi, I'm a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations in Mathematics yet. When I see a math problem like this: 4*(2+5)+12-2*3, I don't know that I'm supposed to follow the order of operations, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). Instead, I might just solve it from left to right, following the traditional rules of algebra.<br><br>First, I would multiply 4 by the result of the expression inside the parentheses, which is 2+5. I would add 2 and 5 to get 7. Then, I would multiply 4 by 7 to get 28.<br><br>Next, I would move on to the addition and subtraction parts of the problem. I would add 12 to the 28 that I just got, which gives me 40.<br><br>Finally, I would subtract 2 times 3 from that result. Multiplying 2 by 3 gives me 6, and subtracting that from 40 leaves me with 34.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: If I was given the math problem 4*(2+5)+12-2*3 and I didn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would probably solve it from left to right. However, this can lead to incorrect results, as I would soon find out.<br><br>So, let's try it:<br><br>First, I would do the addition in the first parentheses, giving me: 4*(7)+12-2*3<br><br>Next, I would do the multiplication, giving me: 28+12-6<br><br>And finally, I would do the addition and subtraction from left to right, giving me: 40-6<br><br>So the answer is:<br><br>The answer is 34.<br><br>However, I have just learned that there is a specific order to solving math problems like this, called PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). So, I should have followed that order instead.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I don't know about order of operations, but I remember my teacher saying to always do addition and subtraction before multiplication and division, and multiplication and division before addition and subtraction again. This is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>So let's follow that rule:<br><br>First, we do the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Then we multiply: 4 * 7 = 28<br><br>Next, we add and subtract from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40, and then 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
