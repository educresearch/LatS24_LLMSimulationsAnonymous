According to this rule, we should do the operations in this specific order: parentheses, orders (like square roots and exponents), division and multiplication (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\nIn the problem 4 * 3 + 2, there are no parentheses, orders, division, or subtraction, so we just need to follow the order of multiplication and addition. Therefore, we should first do the multiplication (4 * 3), and then add the result to 2.\n\nSo, let's calculate: 4 * 3 = 12, and then 12 + 2 = 14.\n\nThe answer is 14."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500", "model": "mixtral-8x7b-instruct", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 500, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in elementary school who knows nothing about order of operations in Mathematics.\n                    Answer the Mathematics question using this given persona and nothing else.\n                    Explain your solution (concise!) to this given Mathematics problem (using the above persona given), and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: If I don't know about order of operations, I would solve this problem step by step, based on how the numbers and operations are written.
