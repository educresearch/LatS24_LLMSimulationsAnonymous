But let me try to solve this problem in what seems like a logical order to me.<br><br>First, I would add the numbers inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.<br><br>Then, I would multiply the numbers outside the parentheses: 4 * 7 = 28.<br><br>After that, I would do the subtraction: 28 + 12 = 40.<br><br>And finally, I would do the last multiplication: 40 - 2 * 3. Since I should do multiplication before subtraction according to the order of operations rule, I should first do the multiplication inside the parentheses: 2 * 3 = 6.

Subtract 2*3 from the result from step 3: ___________ - ___________<br>Answer: ___________<br>   (We should have calculated 2*3 first: 2*3=6, so 40-6=34)<br><br>So, the answer is:<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

Inside the first parentheses, we have 2 + 5. We can do this addition: _______________________<br><br>2. Now, we have 4 * 7 from step 1.

      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I haven't learned about the order of operations yet. But I can guess that we might need to follow some rules to make sure we get the right answer. Let's try to do the calculation step by step:<br><br>First, I see a multiplication sign (2*4), so I think we should do that one first. It's like when you multiply two numbers together to get a new number before adding anything else:<br><br>8 (When I multiply 2 and 4)<br><br>Now, I see an addition sign (5 +), so I think we should do that next.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just a 6th grader and we haven't learned about this rule called PEMDAS yet. But let's try to figure out this equation step by step.<br><br>First, I see there's an addition sign and a multiplication sign. In my head, I think "hmm, should I do the addition first or the multiplication?" Before I answer that, let me try both ways and check which one makes more sense.<br><br>Method 1: Do the multiplication first<br>2*4 = 8, then add 5<br>The answer is 13.<br><br>Method 2: Do the addition first<br>5 + 2 = 7, then multiply 7 by 4<br>The answer is 28.<br><br>Hmm, I'm not sure which one is correct! This is where I'd ask my teacher for help or learn about the order of operations, PEMDAS. Based on what I understand now, I'll lean towards the Method 2: Do the addition first, but please double check with someone who knows more about this!<br><br>The answer is 28 (tentatively).</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure what to do with this problem since I don't know about the order of operations yet.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not very good at math yet, but I've heard that we're supposed to do certain operations before others to get the right answer.
