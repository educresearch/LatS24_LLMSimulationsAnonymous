Let's follow these steps:

1. Solve the expression inside the parentheses: (2+5) = 7
2. Multiply 4 with 7: 4 * 7 = 28
3. Next, we have 12 - 2 * 3. Since we need to follow the subtraction after multiplication, we should solve the multiplication first: 2 * 3 = 6. Now, subtract this product from 12: 12 - 6 = 6.

The answer is 28 + 6.

First, let's do the multiplication because, to me, that seems like it should come before addition in some way, but I'm not really sure. So, 2 * 4 equals 8. Now, I have 5, and I need to add 8. I've heard this concept being referred to as ""order of operations,"" but I'm not quite sure what that means yet.

Let's see if this works: Instead of doing the multiplication first, what if I did the addition first? If I add 5 and 2 (the numbers outside the multiplication symbol), I get 7. And then, I can add 4 to that result. So, 7 + 4 equals 11.

I'm not sure which answer is correct, but one of them must be. Let's see if we can figure it out by comparing these results to the answers we get when we follow the typical ""order of operations"" guidelines (PEMDAS).

The answer is .... let me double-check if 8 = 11 by checking with my teacher or a more experienced mathematician. If that's not correct, then the answer following the order of operations (PEMDAS) should be 5 + (2 * 4) = 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13. I see that, following the order of operations (PEMDAS), I should have done the multiplication before the addition. The correct order is (2 * 4) + 5 = 13. It's important to remember these rules to make sure all calculations are accurate."

Let's try solving each group inside the parentheses first:

1. Multiply 7 by 2: _ _ * 2 = 14
2. Multiply 8 by 5: _ _ * 5 = 40

Now what should I do next? Maybe I should carry the result of the first step to the second one, but I don't think this is how it's done. Let me ask my teacher to clarify this concept called Order of Operations (PEMDAS)!

The answer is (according to my teacher): The answer is 49. To get this answer, you should first do the multiplication inside the parentheses: 8*5=40, and then do the other multiplication 7*2, which equals 14. Finally, add those two results: 40+14=49."

So, I'll do the addition: 4 * 3 + 2 = ___

First, let's find the result of 4 * 3 = 12, then add 2:
12 + 2 = 14

Now I found the answer, but I don't know if this is the right way to do it. I wish someone could explain the order of operations to me.

I see here we have some numbers and some operations. The operations are multiplication, addition, and subtraction. I also see some parentheses. Let's take a look at them step by step, following the order I see:

1. First, the parentheses: I'll open them up and do what's inside first. It says 2 + 5, so that's addition.
2. So, now I have 4 * (7) and 12 - 2 * 3.
3. Next, I do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6.
4. Now I have 28 and 12 - 6.
5. Subtract first: 12 - 6 = 6.
6. Then, I have 28 + 6 = 34.

The answer is 34."
