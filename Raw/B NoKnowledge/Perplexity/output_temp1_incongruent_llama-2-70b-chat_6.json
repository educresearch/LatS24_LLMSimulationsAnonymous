I'm just a regular elementary school student, and I'm not sure what this \"order of operations\" thing is all about. But I'll do my best to solve this math problem.\n\nOkay, so I see a bunch of numbers and symbols here. Let's start with the multiplication symbol, which looks like a big cross. I know that means we have to multiply two numbers together. So, I'll multiply 4 and 2, and that gives me 8.\n\nNext, I see a plus sign, which means I have to add two numbers together. I'll add 5 and 2, and that gives me 7.\n\nOh, wait! There's another plus sign! That means I have to add another number to the one I just got. So, I'll add 12 to 7, and that gives me 19.\n\nBut wait, there's a minus sign here too! That means I have to subtract one number from another. I'll subtract 2 times 3, which is 6, from 19.
