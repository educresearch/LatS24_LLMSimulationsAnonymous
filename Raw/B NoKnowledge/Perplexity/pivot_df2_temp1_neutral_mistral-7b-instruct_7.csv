mistral-7b-instruct,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: As a 6th grade student, I haven't learned about the order of operations yet. But I can try to solve this problem by doing the calculations inside the parentheses first, then the multiplication, and finally the addition and subtraction.

So, let's start by solving the parentheses:

2 + 5 = 7

Now we have: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we do the multiplication:

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now we have: 28 + 12 - 6

Next, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So, the answer is:

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I don't know about the order of operations yet. I'll just do the calculation step by step, following what seems logical to me.

First, I'll do the numbers inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

Now, I'll do the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28

Then, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right:
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

So, The answer is 34.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't know about order of operations yet. So, I would attempt to solve the problem by doing the calculations in the order that I see them from left to right.

Here's how I'd try it:

1. First, I'd do the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7
2. Next, I'd do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28
3. Then, I'd do addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 30 and 30 - 2 * 3 = 28

So, the answer is 28.","GPT Response: I see numbers and symbols on the board, but I don't know which ones to do first yet. Let's try to figure it out step by step! ‚ù∂ Let's start with the parentheses. That means I'll calculate 2 + 5 first: 2 + 5 = 7. ‚ù∑ Now I have 4 * 7 and 12 - 2 * 3. I'll do the multiplication next: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6. ‚ù∏ Lastly, I need to subtract: 12 - 6 = 6. So, the answer is.... 

The answer is 28 + 6 = 34. (But, this is not the correct order of operations!) üòä Remember, the correct order is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, and Division, and lastly Addition and Subtraction. This is called the order of operations, or PEMDAS. So, let's try again: 

First Parentheses (2+5)=7
Then Multiplication: 
4 * 7 = 28
12 * 3 = 36
Addition and Subtraction: 
4 * 7 + 12 * 3 = 28 + 36 = 64. 

Finally, the answer is: The answer is 64. üòä (That's it! We followed the correct order of operations, PEMDAS.)"
mistral-7b-instruct,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: well, I've heard that when doing math problems, there's a special rule we follow called order of operations, but I'm not really sure what that means yet. I think the numbers inside the parentheses should be done first, so let's see:

2

now I have 4 times 3 and 2, but I'm not sure which one to do first. I think maybe the multiplication comes before addition, or is it the other way around? Let me check this rule out...

oh, I see! It's called PEMDAS, and according to that, multiplication and division should be done before addition and subtraction. So, let's give it a try:

12 (4*3)

now, I just have to do the multiplication:

12 (12)

and the answer is:

The answer is 144.","GPT Response: Well, I'm just a grade 6 student and I've never heard of PEMDAS or order of operations before. But, let's try to solve this problem step by step.

First, I see a multiplication sign (4*3), so I guess I should do that first, right? But, then I see an addition sign (4*3+2). Maybe I should do the addition first, or the multiplication? Hmm...

Let me try doing the multiplication first: 

4*3=12

Now, I have 12 and a + sign, and a 2. What does + mean again? It means to add the numbers together, right?

So, let's add 12 and 2:

12+2=14

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: I'm not sure about the special rules for doing math problems. But I can tell you what I see in this problem. There is multiplication and addition. I think I should do the multiplication first and then the addition. So, I will calculate 4 times 3, which gives me 12. Then I will add 2 to 12. The answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Well, I see some numbers and some symbols, but I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do first. Let's try this step by step:

First, I think the multiplication comes before the addition, but I'm not completely sure, so let's do that first:

4 * 3 = 12

Now, I have 12 and 2. I think addition is usually done after multiplication, so let's do that next:

12 + 2 = 14

The answer is __.
So, the answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure about this thing called order of operations. But I think we're supposed to do the multiplication before the addition, right? So, let's do that first: 2 multiplied by 4 is 8. Then, we add 5 to get the final answer.

The answer is: 5 + 2*4 = 5 + 8 = 13.","GPT Response: Well, I'm just a sixth-grade student, and we haven't learned about the order of operations yet, but let me give it a try. I think we should do the multiplication first because the asterisk (*) symbol represents multiplication, and then add the results to the number next to it. So, let's calculate 2*4 = 8, and then add 5 to get the final answer.

The answer is __.

The answer is 8 + 5 = 13.","GPT Response: Well, I've been taught to do addition first and then multiplication. So, let's do the addition first:

5 + 2 * 4

Now, I see that there's a multiplication sign in between 2 and 4. I guess I should do that before adding the numbers:

5 + (2 * 4)

Next, I'll perform the multiplication operation:

5 + 8

Lastly, I'll complete the addition:

13

The answer is __.
Answer: 13.","GPT Response: Well, I know that I have to do the multiplication before adding in a bigger math problem, but since this one only has addition and multiplication, I guess I'll just do it one step at a time, like when we learn to count. So first, I do the multiplication, which makes it 2 times 4, and that's 8. Then, I add 5 to that, so the answer is 13.

The answer is 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure about this, but I think we might need to follow some rules when doing math problems, right? I mean, there's usually an order we're supposed to do things in. But I've never heard this one called out before... let me see, it's something like Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from what I overheard), then Addition and Subtraction, right? So, let me give it a try based on that:

First, I'll do the multiplication part: 3*2 = 6.
Then, I'll move on to addition: 5 + 6.
Lastly, the answer would be 11.

So, The answer is __, 11.  
(*proudly raises hand for approval*)

Is that correct, Mr./Mrs. Math Teacher? *hoping for a pat on the back*","GPT Response: Well, this problem has some numbers and some symbols, but I don't know anything about the rules for solving them in a certain order yet. Let's just do the multiplication and addition in the order that they appear from left to right, shall we? That's what my brain tells me to do. So, I'll do the multiplication first:

3 * 2 = 6

Now, I'll do the addition:

5 + 6 = 11

So, following the instructions from my unknown brain, the answer is:

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I'm not familiar with the order of operations in mathematics yet. So, I would suggest doing the multiplication first because the numbers are next to each other, then adding the numbers.

Here's how I would solve it:

1. Multiply 3 and 2: 3 x 2 = 6
2. Add 5 to the result: 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Well, I see numbers and symbols on this paper, but I don't know what they mean yet. I've heard the adults call it ""doing the math,"" but I don't really get it. I'll try to follow along with what I've seen them do. Let's start with the plus sign, I think that means ""add."" So, we have 5 and 3, which makes 8. Now, there are these stars near 3 and 2. When I see those, I remember seeing the adults talk about ""doing the multiplication first."" So, let's do that: 3 times 2 makes 6. Alright, so now I have 8 and 6. One more step: add those together. So, 8 + 6 equals 14. The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Well, I'm a 6th grader and I've never heard about order of operations in mathematics before. This question gives me two operations: multiplication and addition. I'm not sure which one to do first, so I'll try doing the multiplication first since it seems easier to remember the multiplication table.

So, I'll calculate the first multiplication: 7*2 = 14
Then, I'll calculate the second multiplication: 8*5 = 40

Now, I have two results, 14 and 40. I have no idea what to do next since there's only addition remaining, and I don't remember any particular order for addition. So I'll just add the numbers:

14 (from the first multiplication)
+ 40 (from the second multiplication)

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: (First, I'll do the multiplication because I heard teachers say that's what we should do first.)

1. I'll do 7 * 2 = 14.
2. Next, I'll do 8 * 5 = 40.
3. Now, I'll add the results, so 14 + 40 = 54.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations in mathematics. But I can try to solve the problem based on what I know. Let's do the multiplication first and then add the results together.

So, I'll do 7 times 2, which gives me 14. Then, I'll do 8 times 5, which gives me 40. Finally, I'll add those two numbers together:

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Well, I know that numbers inside parentheses or exponents should be done first, but in this problem, there are no parentheses or exponents. So, I guess we do multiplication before addition, like when we learn long multiplication in later grades, right? But to be sure, let me write it out: first, I'll do 7 times 2, then 8 times 5. That gives me 14 and 40, respectively. Now, I'll add those numbers together: 14 + 40 equals 54. The answer is 54."
