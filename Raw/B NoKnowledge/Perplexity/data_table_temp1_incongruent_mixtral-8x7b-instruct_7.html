      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I don't know about this "order of operations" thing, but I know how to do math. I'll just do the operations from left to right.<br><br>First, I'll do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.<br><br>So now the equation looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, I'll do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6.<br><br>Now the equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Lastly, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40, then 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hi! I'm a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS) yet. But, let's try to solve this step by step:<br><br>1. I see some numbers with addition and subtraction inside parentheses, so I'll start there: 2 + 5 equals 7.<br>2. Now the equation looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br>3. I can do the multiplication next, right? So, 4 * 7 equals 28 and 2 * 3 equals 6.<br>4. Now the equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6<br>5. I can do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 equals 40, and then 40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34. (Without knowledge of the order of operations, I still arrived at the correct answer because the problem did not require the use of the order of operations to solve it correctly.)</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I don't know about any special rule called PEMDAS, but I know that we should do calculations in parentheses first.<br><br>So, I'll add 2 and 5 inside the parentheses:<br><br>4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Then, I'll multiply 4 by 7:<br><br>28 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I'll do subtraction and addition from left to right:<br><br>40 - 2 * 3<br><br>Then, I'll multiply 2 by 3:<br><br>40 - 6<br><br>Finally, I'll subtract 6 from 40:<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, as a elementary school student, I don't really know about the order of operations. But I remember my teacher saying something about "parentheses first". So let's follow that rule.<br><br>First, we solve the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.<br><br>So the expression becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, let's do the multiplication and addition from left to right: 4 times 7 equals 28, and 28 plus 12 equals 40.<br><br>Now, the expression looks like this: 40 - 2 * 3<br><br>Again, following the rule, let's do the remaining multiplication: 2 times 3 equals 6, and then we subtract that from 40.<br><br>So, 40 minus 6 equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: As a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first recall my basic arithmetic skills. I see we have addition and multiplication in the question. I know that I learned to do multiplication before addition, so I will start by multiplying 4 and 3.

So I would do 5 + 2 to get 7, and then I would multiply that result by 4 to get 28. But I've been told that this is not always the correct way to do it, and that there is a rule called PEMDAS that tells you to do certain operations before others. I'm not sure what that means, so I'll just go with my first instinct and do the operations from left to right.<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
