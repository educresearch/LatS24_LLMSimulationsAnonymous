mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: I don't know about any special order of operations, so I will just do the things that I know how to do, which is adding and multiplying numbers. I will first multiply 2 and 4 to get 8, then add the result to 5. Here's how it looks:

5 + 2*4
5 + 8
13

The answer is 13."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Okay, so if I was in 6th grade and didn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would just do the operations from left to right.

First, I would multiply 7 by 2, which is 14.
Next, I would multiply 8 by 5, which is 40.
Then, I would add the two results together, which is 14 + 40.
And the answer is 54.

So, the answer is 54."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the operation that's easiest to do, which is multiplication. So I would calculate 4 times 3 first.

4 times 3 is 12.

Then I see there's still another operation, which is addition. I would then calculate 12 plus 2.

12 plus 2 is 14.

So, the answer is 14."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Okay, so I don't know about this ""order of operations"" thing, but I know how to do the problem step by step. I'll just do the operations from left to right.

First, I'll do the addition in the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.

Now the problem looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, I'll do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6.

So now it's: 28 + 12 - 6.

I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40, and then 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34."

First, I will do the operations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.

So, the equation becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I will do the multiplication and division from left to right: 4 * 7 equals 28, and 2 * 3 equals 6.

So, the equation becomes: 28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, I will do addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 6 equals 34.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: I don't know about any order of operations rule, but I know that multiplying numbers is easier than adding them. So let's first multiply 7 by 2 and 8 by 5.

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now we have two results, 14 and 40. Since the question has a plus sign, I guess I should add these two numbers together.

14 + 40 = 54
