      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations (PEMDAS) in mathematics. So, I would solve the expression from left to right and from the inside out without worrying about any special rules. Here's how I would do it:<br><br>1. First, I'd do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7<br>2. Next, I'd do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28<br>3. And finally, I'd do the remaining addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40, and then 40 - 2 * 3 = 38 (Since we follow the multiplication before subtraction in the order of operations, but since I'm not aware of it, I did the subtraction last.)<br><br>The answer is 38.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I don't know about order of operations yet. But, I'll try to solve the problem in a logical way. I believe we should do the operations inside the parentheses first, then exponents, then multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally addition and subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>Let's apply this logic to the problem:<br><br>1. Solve the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7<br>2. Multiply: 4 * 7 = 28<br>3. Add: 28 + 12 = 40<br>4. Multiply: 2 * 3 = 6<br>5. Subtract: 40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure what the numbers and symbols mean in this equation. But I see there are numbers, addition, multiplication, and subtraction. I think I should do the operation inside the parentheses first, then do multiplication, and finally addition and subtraction. So let's try that:<br><br>First, I'll do 2 + 5 which equals 7. Then I'll multiply 4 and 7, which equals 28. So now I have 28.<br><br>Next, I'll do multiplication: 12 * 3 equals 36.<br><br>Lastly, I'll do addition and subtraction: 28 + 36 equals 64 and 64 - 2 equals 62.<br><br>So, the answer is 62.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I have to do the numbers inside the parentheses, so that's 2 + 5 = 7. Now, I have 4 times 7 and 12, and 2 times 3. I will do the multiplication before addition and subtraction, as told by my teacher. So, 4 times 7 is 28, and 2 times 3 is 6.<br><br>Now I have 28 and 12, so I add them: 28 + 12 = 40. Lastly, I have 40 and 6, so I add them: 40 + 6 = 46.<br><br>The answer is 46.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations rule (PEMDAS). But I can still try to solve this math problem by following the common sense rule that multiplication should be done before addition. So, here's my attempt:<br><br>First, I'll do the multiplication:<br>4 * 3 = 12<br><br>Then, I'll do the addition:<br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>So, the answer is: The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just an elementary school student, so I don't really know about any special rules for solving math problems. But I can try to follow the steps that I've learned. So, let's do this problem: 4 times 3, and then add 2. That is, 12 (which is 4 times 3), and then 12 plus 2. So, the answer is... 14.<br><br>The answer is __.<br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I see numbers and signs, but I'm not sure what they mean yet. Let's try this step by step:<br><br>First, I'll do the multiplication because I think the numbers are being combined before the addition according to some rules I've heard adults talking about. So, 4 multiplied by 3 is 12.<br><br>Now, I have 12 and 2. This time, I'll do the addition because I remember adding two numbers together makes a new number. So, 12 + 2 equals 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure about this "order of operations" thing you mentioned. But, from what I can tell in this problem, it looks like we should do the math inside the parentheses first, if there were any. Since there are no parentheses here, let's see what we can do.<br><br>The plus sign (+) usually means we add numbers together. But, what about the asterisk (*)? Shouldn't that be for addition too, since it's closer to the plus sign?<br><br>No, it's actually for multiplication. So, let's do that first. That gives us:<br><br>2 * 4 = 8<br><br>Now, let's add that number to the remaining number:<br><br>5 + 8 = 13<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just a 6th grade student and we haven't learnt anything about the order of operations yet.But I can tell you that when we do the arithmetic in this expression, we should probably do the multiplication before the addition, as the * symbol represents multiplication and + represents addition. So let's see, 2 multiplied by 4 equals 8, and then we add 5:<br><br>The answer is: 5 + 2*4 = 5 + 8 = 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a fourth grader, I've just started learning addition and multiplication, but I haven't learned the order of operations yet. When I see this problem, 5 + 2*4, I'd try solving it step by step, but I might make a mistake because I don't know the rule for multiplication before addition.<br><br>My process:<br>1. I see the addition sign first, so I think I should add 5 and 4 right away. But, 4 is a part of 2*4, which is a multiplication problem.<br>2. I'm unsure of which operation to do first. Let's see if we can simplify the problem somehow before trying to add or multiply.<br><br>The answer is: I'm not confident in my answer without knowing the order of operations rule. Instead, I'd ask my teacher or classmate for help.<br><br>The correct answer is 11. (5 + 2*4 = 5 + (2*4) = 5 + 8 = 11)</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmmm, I'm not sure what to do first in this problem. I know how to add and I know how to multiply, but I don't know the rule about doing certain operations before others.Let's try it this way:<br><br>I see a multiplication sign (&times;) between 2 and 4, so I'll do that first: 2 &times; 4 = 8.<br><br>Now I have 5 + 8. Adding 5 and 8 gives me 13.<br><br>The answer is __.<br>Answer: The answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm not really familiar with the order of operations rule, PEMDAS. But I think I can still try to figure out which operation to do first based on some basic math knowledge.<br><br>From what I remember, I believe we usually do multiplication before addition, because we learn that when dealing with real-life situations. For example, if I have 5 apples and get 2 more apples, it makes more sense to me to get the 2 additional apples first and then add them to the 5 I already have. So, in the given expression, I would do the multiplication first:<br><br>5 + 3 * 2<br>5 + 6<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure about this, but I think we should do the multiplication first before adding. So, Let's do 3 multiplied by 2 which equals 6. Then, add 5 to the result which gives us an answer of 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't know about the order of operations yet. So, I would suggest we do the addition and multiplication at the same time and follow the simple rule: perform multiplication before addition. in this case, we have 3 multiplied by 2, which equals 6. Then, we add 5 to the product, giving us a final answer of 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure what to do first because I haven't learned about order of operations yet. But I think it might be better to do the multiplication first and then the addition. So, let's do 3 multiplied by 2, which equals 6. Then I'll add 5 to that number.<br><br>So the calculation would look like this: <br>3 * 2 = 6<br>6 + 5 = 11<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hm, this looks like a fun puzzle! But I'm just a little elementary school student, and I've never heard of something called "order of operations" before. Since we don't have any parentheses in this equation, I think I'll just do the multiplication first, and then the addition.<br><br>So, I'll start with the multiplication: 7 * 2 = 14, and 8 * 5 = 40.<br><br>Now I have two numbers, 14 and 40.
