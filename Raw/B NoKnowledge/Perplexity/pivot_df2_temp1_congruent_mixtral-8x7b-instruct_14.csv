mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to answer that math problem as a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS).

At first, I would think that I should do the operations from left to right. So I would start by multiplying 4 and 2, and get 8. Then I would add 5, and get 13. Next, I would multiply 4 and 13, and get 52.

Then, I would move on to the next operation, which is addition. I would add 12 to 52, and get 64.

Finally, I would do the last operation, which is multiplication. I would multiply 2 and 3, and get 6. Then, I would subtract 6 from 64, and get 58.

Therefore, the answer is 58.","GPT Response: Hello, I'm a grade 6 student who doesn't know about order of operations (PEMDAS) yet. When I see a math problem like this: 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3, I would solve it step by step.

First, I would do the operations inside the parentheses:

4*7 + 12 - 2*3

Next, I would do the multiplication:

28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, I would do addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: I don't know about any order of operations rules, so I'll just do the math from left to right.

First, I'll do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.

Then, I'll multiply: 4 times 7 is 28, and 2 times 3 is 6.

Next, I'll add and subtract in order: first, add 28 and 12, which gives 40, then subtract 6 from 40, leaving 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: I don't know about order of operations, but I know that we should do the operations inside the parentheses first. So I'll add 2 and 5 to get 7. Then I have:

4 \* 7 + 12 - 2 \* 3

Next, I'll do the multiplication. I see that there are two multiplication operations, and I don't know about the order in which I should do them, but I'll start by doing the one on the right, 2 \* 3, to get 6. Then I have:

4 \* 7 + 12 - 6

Now I'll do the multiplication on the left, which is 4 \* 7, to get 28. Then I have:

28 + 12 - 6

Finally, I'll do addition and subtraction from left to right. First, I add 28 and 12 to get 40. Then I subtract 6 from 40 to get 34.

The answer is 34."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first remember that in elementary school, we usually do addition and subtraction before multiplication and division.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: As a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the problem from left to right. So I would add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then I would multiply 7 by 4 to get 28. But I realize that I learned another rule called PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction). I remember now that Multiplication and Division should be done before Addition and Subtraction. So I should have multiplied 2 by 4 first, and then added 5.

Wait, I just remembered! There's something called the order of operations that I'm supposed to follow. I should do any multiplication or division before addition or subtraction. So, I should actually multiply 2 by 4 first to get 8, and then add 5 to get 13.
