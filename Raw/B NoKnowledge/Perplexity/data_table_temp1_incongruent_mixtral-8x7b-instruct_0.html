      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I don't know about this order of operations thing, but I'll just do the math from left to right.<br><br>First, I'll add 2 and 5 inside the parentheses, which gives me 7. Then I have 4 times 7, which is 28. Now my equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, I'll do the subtraction and addition from left to right, so I'll add 28 and 12 to get 40, and then I'll subtract 2 times 3.

      <td>GPT Response: Hi! I'm a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS) yet. But let's try to solve this problem: 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3.<br><br>First, I would do the operations inside the parentheses: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Then, I would do the multiplication: 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>After that, I would do the addition: 40 - 6.<br><br>Finally, I would do the subtraction: 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I would follow these steps:<br>1. Solve the operation inside the parentheses first, which is 2 + 5, giving me 7.<br>2. Next, I would do the multiplication, so I would multiply 4 by 7, giving me 28.<br>3. Then, I would add 12 to 28, giving me 40.<br>4. Lastly, I would do the remaining multiplication, which is 2 times 3, giving me 6.<br>5. Finally, I would subtract 6 from 40.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh boy, this looks like a fun math problem! But I'm just an elementary school student and I don't know about order of operations yet. I think I should ask my teacher about something called "BIDMAS" or "PEMDAS" which tells you how to solve these kinds of problems.<br><br>Okay, I asked my teacher and she said BIDMAS/PEMDAS stands for Brackets/Parentheses, Indices/Exponents, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). That sounds like a mouthful, but I get it! We need to solve the problem step-by-step in that order.<br><br>1. First, I see there are parentheses, so I'll do the operation inside: 2 + 5 = 7.<br>2. Now the problem looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br>3. Next, I see multiplication and division, so I'll do those: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6.<br>4. The problem now looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.<br>5. Lastly, I see addition and subtraction, so I'll do those from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40 and then 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: As a sixth-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will simply solve this step by step from left to right.<br><br>First, I'll do the multiplication: 4 times 3 equals 12.<br>Then I'll do the addition: 12 plus 2 equals 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a 6th grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first guess that the answer is 14, because I would do the multiplication and addition from left to right. But I know that's not the right way to do it, because I remember my teacher saying something about a specific order to follow. I'm not sure what it is yet, but I hope I'll learn it soon!<br><br>But for now, I would answer this question by following the order that my teacher showed us in class, which is to do the multiplication and division before the addition and subtraction. So I would first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12, and then add 2 to get 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

But I know my answer should have just one digit because there's only one number in the question with more than one digit. So I need to check with my teacher or the grown-ups about this new thing called "order of operations" to be sure.<br><br>But if I had to guess again without knowing about it, I would try to do the multiplication and addition at the same time, but that doesn't make sense. So I'll just stick with my first guess of 14 for now.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
