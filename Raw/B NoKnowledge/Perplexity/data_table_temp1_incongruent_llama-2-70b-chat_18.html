      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 multiplied by something. That something is 2+5, which is 7. So, 4 times 7 is 28.<br><br>Next, I see a plus sign and a 12. That means I add 12 to 28, which gives me 40.<br><br>But wait, there's more! There's a minus sign and a 2 times 3, which is 6. So, I subtract 6 from 40, and that gives me 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 multiplication symbol, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 2+5. That gives me 4 * 7 = 28.<br><br>Next, I see the addition symbol, so I'll add 12 to 28, which gives me 40.<br><br>Finally, I see the subtraction symbol, so I'll subtract 2 times 3 from 40, which gives me 34.<br><br>The answer is 34!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! Let's see...<br><br>First, we need to do the addition inside the parentheses. That's 2 + 5, which is 7.<br><br>So, the equation becomes 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, we need to do the multiplication. 4 * 7 is 28.<br><br>Then, we add 12, which makes it 40.<br><br>Finally, we subtract 2 * 3, which is 6.<br><br>The answer is 34!</td>

That's a pretty easy number to work with. Then I see a 2 and a 4. Hmm, I'm not sure what to do with those yet. Oh wait, I see the word " multiplication"! That means I have to multiply the 2 and the 4 together, right? So that's 8.<br><br>Now, I have 5 and 8. I'm not sure what to do next. Do I add them together? Yeah, that sounds right! So 5 + 8 = 13.<br><br>The answer is 13!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm trying to solve this math problem, and I'm not sure what to do. It says 5+2 * 4. I know that 5+2 is 7, but then it says to multiply 4 by 7, and that's where I get lost. I don't know what to do next. Can someone help me out?<br><br>Okay, so I've been thinking about it, and I think I might know the answer. If I do 5+2, that's 7, and then if I multiply 7 by 4, that's 28. So, the answer is 28! Right?<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
