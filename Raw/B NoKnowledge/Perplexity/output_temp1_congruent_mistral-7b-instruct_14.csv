But I can try to solve this problem based on what I know about addition and multiplication.

First, I see that there is an addition sign and a multiplication sign together in one expression. I've heard that when there are two or more operations in one line, you should do the multiplication first, and then do the addition. So that's what I'll try to do.

Therefore, I will do the multiplication operation first, which is 2 * 4 = 8. Then I'll do the addition operation, which is 5 + 8.

So, the calculation will be like this:

2 * 4 = 8 (multiplication)
5 + 8 = 13 (addition)

Now that I've done both the multiplication and the addition, I can give you the answer:

The answer is 13."

First, I think we should do the mathematical operations inside the parentheses if there are any. But in this problem, there are no parentheses. So let's move on to the next rule: exponents. I don't see any exponents here though.

The next rule is multiplication and division. Both 7 and 8 are numbers, so they're not division, and the ""*"" symbol means multiplication. So, let's do the multiplications first:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

I'll do the multiplication first and then the addition:

1. Multiply 4 and 3:  tens = 4, ones = 3, result = 12. So 4*3 = 12.
2. Next, I have 12 and 2. I add them together: tens = 1, ones = 2, result = 13.

The answer is 13."

First, let's do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.

Now we have 4 times 7, which is the same as having 4 groups of 7. So, we Multiply 4 and 7 to get 28, and then we multiply 28 by all the other numbers around it.

We have 28 and need to add 12, so the sum is 40.

Finally, we need to subtract 2 times 3. We multiply 2 and 3 to get 6, and then we subtract 6 from 40.

The answer is 34."

But I can try to guess based on what I know about addition and multiplication. I think I should do the multiplication first, because I've seen that in some problems, and then add the results. So, let's try that:

First, I'll do the multiplication: 3*2 equals 6.

Next, I'll add 5 to the result of the multiplication: 5 + 6.

Now, let's do the addition: 5 + 6 equals 11.

So, the answer is:

The answer is 11."
