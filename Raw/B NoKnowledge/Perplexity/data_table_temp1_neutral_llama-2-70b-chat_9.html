      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it my best shot.<br><br>So, the problem is 4*(2+5)+12-2*3, right? I think I'll start by multiplying 4 and 2+5, that's 4*7=28.<br><br>Next, I see a plus sign, so I'll add 12 to 28, that's 40.<br><br>Now, there's a minus sign, so I'll subtract 2 times 3 from 40, that's 40-6=34.<br><br>The answer is 34!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll give it my best shot!<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 and the parentheses, so I'll start by multiplying 4 by what's inside the parentheses. That's 4*7, which is 28.<br><br>Next, I see the 12, so I'll add that to 28. That gives me 40.<br><br>Now, I see the -2*3. I'm not sure what that means, but I think it means I have to subtract 6 from 40. So, 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey, I'm not sure how to do this thing with all these letters and stuff. Can you help me out?<br><br>Okay, so I see there are some numbers and symbols here. Let's see... 4 times 2 is 8, plus 5 is 13, and then plus 12 is... hmmm... 25? No, that can't be right.<br><br>Oh wait, I see! There's this thing called PEMDAS, right? So that means we have to do the stuff inside the parentheses first.<br><br>So, 2+5 is 7, and then 4 times 7 is... carry the 1... 28! And then plus 12 is 40.<br><br>But wait, there's more! There's a minus sign here too! 2 times 3 is 6, and then minus 6 is... 34!<br><br>The answer is 34.<br><br>I hope that's right! Can you tell me if I did it correctly?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, let's see...<br><br>First, we need to do the addition inside the parentheses. That's 2+5, which is 7.<br><br>Next, we multiply 4 by 7, and that's 28.<br><br>Then, we add 12 to 28, and that's 40.<br><br>Last, we subtract 2 times 3, which is 6.<br><br>So, the final answer is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

Next, I see a 2 and a 4. These numbers are multiplying each other, so I'll do that next. 2 times 4 is 8.<br><br>Now, I see a plus sign, and that means I need to add something. I've got my 5 and my 8. Let's see... 5 plus 8 is 13!<br><br>The answer is 13.<br><br>I hope that's right! Did I do okay following PEMDAS?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll give it my best shot!<br><br>So, 5+2*4... hmmm... I think I should start by multiplying 2 and 4. That's easy, it's just 8!<br><br>Now, I have 5 + 8... oh wait, I think I need to add 5 and 8! Okay, that's 13.<br><br>The answer is 13!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...<br><br>Okay, I know I have to follow some rules to solve this problem.

That's easy, it's like counting on my fingers. 5 + 2 = 7.<br><br>Now, I know I have to do something with the 4, but I'm not sure what. Wait, I remember! My teacher said something about multiplication being like repeated addition. So, if I have 2 groups of 4 things, that's like having 8 things altogether!<br><br>So, I can multiply 2 and 4 by adding 8: 2 x 4 = 8.<br><br>Now, I have to add 7 and 8 together. That's easy: 7 + 8 = 15.<br><br>The answer is 15.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know that in math, we have something called PEMDAS. It stands for "Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction."

There are no exponents here, so I can skip that step too.<br><br>Then, I have to do the multiplication. Oh wait, there is a multiplication sign! It says 3*2.
