And there's another multiplication: 2 * 3 = 6<br>4. Lastly, I notice there are addition and subtraction signs: Adding numbers on the right side, 12 + 1 = 13. Then, subtracting the smaller number on the left side, 28 - 2 = 26.<br><br>The answer is 26.<br>(I'm just a kid, remember!

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I know that in math we sometimes need to follow certain rules to make sure we get the right answer.

I guess I should try doing the multiplication first since it's there in the middle, right? So let's do that:<br><br>3 * 2 = 6<br><br>Now, there's a plus sign left. I'll add the numbers that the plus sign connects:<br><br>5 + 6 = 11<br><br>The answer is 11.
