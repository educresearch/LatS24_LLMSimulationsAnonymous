mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Okay, I'm a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS). So, let's break down this problem step by step.

First, I'll do the operations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7. Now it looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, since I don't know about the order of operations yet, I'll just do the operations from left to right. I'll do the multiplication first: 4 * 7 equals 28 and 2 * 3 equals 6. Now it looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.

Lastly, I'll do addition and subtraction from left to right. I'll add 28 and 12, which gives me 40, and then subtract 6 from it.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Hi! I'm a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS) yet. When I see a math problem like this: 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3, I would just do the operations from left to right.

First, I would do the addition inside the parentheses: 4 * (7)+12-2 * 3
Then, I would do the multiplication: 28+12-6
Lastly, I would do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 40-6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: I don't know about any order of operations rule, but I know that we have to do the operations one by one. I will start with the operations inside the parentheses.

4 \* (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 \* 3
= 4 \* 7 + 12 - 2 \* 3 (add 2 and 5 inside the parentheses)
= 28 + 12 - 2 \* 3 (multiply 4 and 7)
= 28 + 12 - 6 (multiply 2 and 3)
= 40 - 6 (add 28 and 12)
= 34 (subtract 6 from 40)

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I would start with the part of the problem inside the parentheses, since that's where you should start according to my teacher. So, I would add 2 + 5 to get 7. Then, the problem looks like this: 4 \* 7 + 12 - 2 \* 3.

Next, I would do the multiplication and addition, because multiplication and division come before addition and subtraction. So I would do 4 \* 7 to get 28 and 2 \* 3 to get 6. Then, the problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.

Finally, I would do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So I would add 28 + 12 to get 40 and then subtract 6 from 40 to get 34.

The answer is 34."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the multiplication and addition from left to right. So I would first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12, and then add 2 to get 14. However, I recently learned that there is a rule called PEMDAS that tells us the order in which we should do operations.

According to PEMDAS, parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right) are the order of operations. So even though I first thought of doing the multiplication and addition from left to right, I should actually do the multiplication first, and then the addition.

Doing the multiplication first, I get 12 (which is 4 * 3). Then, I add 2 to get 14 (which is 12 + 2).

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a 6th grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first remember that multiplying and adding numbers is just like following the steps of a recipe - you do the operations in the order that they appear from left to right.

So when I see the expression ""4 * 3 + 2"", I would first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12.

Then, I would add 2 to the result of the multiplication, which gives me 12 + 2 = 14.

Therefore, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: If I was given the math problem 4 * 3 + 2 and I didn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would still follow the natural order of operations: multiply and divide before adding and subtracting. So first, I would multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then, I would add 2 to get 14. Therefore, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't know about the order of operations rule yet. But I remember my teacher saying that in a math expression with only addition and multiplication, we should do the operation that is next to the number first.

Looking at the expression 4 * 3 + 2, I see that there are only addition and multiplication, so I can do it step by step.

First, I'll multiply 4 by 3 and get 12.
Then, I'll add 2 to 12 and get 14.

Doing this, I get:

7 * 4 = 28

So the answer is:

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: As a sixth-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will just solve this step by step according to how I was taught.

First, I will do the addition since that's what I see first:

5 + 2 = 7

Then, I will multiply the result I got from the addition to the number 4:

7 * 4 = 28

So, the answer is:

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: I would add 5 and 2 first because I don't know about order of operations. So I would get 7. But I heard that there is a rule called PEMDAS which means you should do multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. If I follow that rule, then I should do the multiplication first, so I should multiply 2 by 4 to get 8, and then add 5 to get 13.
The answer is 13.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't know about the order of operations yet. But I can still try to solve this problem:

First, I will add 5 and 2 to get 7.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: As a 6th grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think about doing the addition and multiplication at the same time because the question doesn't tell me what to do first. However, I remember my teacher mentioning something about rules to follow when there are different operations in a math problem.

If we just do the addition and multiplication from left to right, we get:

5 + 3 * 2
= 8 * 2
= 16

But, if we follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), we should do the multiplication before the addition:

5 + 3 * 2
= 5 + 6
= 11

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will solve this problem step by step.

First, I will do the addition since that's what I see first:

5 + 3 = 8

Now, I have a new equation: 8 * 2

Next, I will do the multiplication:

8 * 2 = 16

So, the answer is:

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: I don't know about any special rules like PEMDAS yet, so I will just do the operations in them order they appear. I will add 5 and 3 first, then multiply the result by 2.

So, I would first multiply 7 by 2, which gives 14. Then, I would multiply 8 by 5, which gives 40. After that, I would add the two results, 14 and 40, together.

Therefore, the answer is 54.","GPT Response: Well, as a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think that I need to do all the multiplication and addition from left to right. 

So, I would first multiply 7 by 2, which equals 14. Then, I would multiply 8 by 5, which equals 40. Lastly, I would add the results of the two multiplication operations, which gives me 14 + 40.

Therefore, The answer is 54.","GPT Response: As a elementary school student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think about doing the operation that is easy and I'm familiar with. I see multiplication and addition in the problem. I know how to multiply and add, but I'm not sure what to do first.

I see that there are no parenthesis, exponents, division, or subtraction in the problem, so I guess it doesn't matter in what order I do the multiplication and addition. I will just do the multiplication first and then the addition.

For the first multiplication, I get 7 times 2 which equals 14.
For the second multiplication, I get 8 times 5 which equals 40.
Then, I add the results of the two multiplications: 14 + 40 equals 54.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Well, I don't know much about this order of operations thing, but I know that multiplication is kind of like a strong glue. So, I would do all the multiplications first.

So, 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40.

Then, I add those two results together: 14 plus 40 makes 54.

The answer is 54."
