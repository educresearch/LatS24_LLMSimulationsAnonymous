llama-2-70b-chat,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm not really sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it a try.

Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4, and it looks like it's multiplying something. There's some stuff inside the parentheses, so I'll do that first.

Inside the parentheses, there's a 2 and a 5. I think I'm supposed to add those together, so that's 7.

Now, there's this thing that says ""plus 12"". I think that means I add 12 to the 7 I just got. So, that's 19.

But wait, there's more! There's a 2 and a 3, and it looks like I'm supposed to multiply them. That's 6.

Now, there's a minus sign, and it looks like I'm supposed to subtract 6 from 19. That gives me 13.

The answer is 13.

I hope that's right! Can someone tell me if I did it correctly?","GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thingy is all about. But I'll give it my best shot!

So, the problem is 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3, right?

First, I'll do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28 (I'm not sure what the parentheses mean, so I'll just do the multiplication and hope for the best!)

Next, I'll add 12: 28 + 12 = 40

Finally, I'll subtract 2 times 3: 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34!

I hope that's correct, and if it's not, I hope my teacher will help me understand what I did wrong.","GPT Response: Hmm, I'm not sure how to do this problem. I know I need to follow some rules, but I don't know what they are. I think I need to do the multiplication first, so I'll start by multiplying 4 by 2+5. That gives me 4 * 7 = 28.

Next, I need to add 12 to 28, so I get 40.

Finally, I need to subtract 2 times 3 from 40. That's 2 * 3 = 6, so I subtract 6 from 40 and get 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: I don't know what the order of operations is, but I can try to solve the problem step by step.

First, I see a multiplication sign, so I will multiply 4 and 2+5.
2+5 is 7, so I will multiply 4 and 7.
4 * 7 = 28

Next, I see a plus sign, so I will add 12 to 28.
28 + 12 = 40

Finally, I see a minus sign, so I will subtract 2 times 3 from 40.
40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, so we have 4 times 3, that's 12.
Then we have plus 2, so that's 12 + 2, which is 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

Okay, so the problem is 4 * 3 + 2. I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll do the multiplication first. 4 * 3 is equal to 12.

Now, I need to add 2 to 12. That's easy! 12 + 2 is equal to 14.

So, the answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll do the multiplication first.
4 * 3 = 12

Now, I have 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Okay, let's see... 4 times 3 is 12, and then we add 2, so that's 14. The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Hmm, okay, let me think about this...

So, we have five plus two, that's easy, it's seven.
But then we have that funny symbol, the multiplication sign.
It looks like a cross, doesn't it?
I know, let's call it a "" multiplication cross"".
Okay, so we have seven multiplication cross four.
Hmm... what does that mean?
I think it means we have to make seven groups of four things.
Like seven groups of four apples.
That would be... hmm... twenty-eight apples!
So, the answer is twenty-eight.
The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But let's try to solve this math problem together!

Okay, so we have 5+2 * 4. I know that 5 is a bigger number than 2, so let's start by adding 5 and 2. That gives us 7.

Now, we have 7 * 4. I'm not sure what the * symbol means, but I think it means we have to multiply 7 and 4. So, 7 x 4 = 28.

So, the answer is 28!

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that when you have addition and multiplication in a problem, you have to do the multiplication first. So, I'll do the multiplication part: 2 * 4 = 8.

Now, I have 5 + 8. I know that 5 is less than 8, so I'll add them: 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: Okay! So, let's see... 5 + 2 is 7, and 7 * 4 is... hang on, let me count it out... 7, 14, 21, 28! The answer is 28!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure how to do this problem, but I think I know what the order of operations means. It's like a recipe for solving math problems. So, I think I should follow these steps:

1. First, I should do the multiplication, because it's inside the parentheses. That's what the ""P"" in PEMDAS stands for, right? So, 3 * 2 = 6.
2. Next, I should do the addition. That's what the ""A"" in PEMDAS stands for. So, 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Sure, I'll give it a try!

So, we have 5 + 3 * 2. I know that when we multiply, we do it before we add. That's just how we do things in grade 6! So, let's multiply 3 and 2 first.

3 * 2 = 6

Now, we add 5 and 6.

5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this problem...

Okay, I know that when we add numbers, we do it from left to right. So, first, I'll add 5 and 3, and that gives me 8.

Now, I see that there's a multiplication sign, and I know that multiplication comes before addition. So, I'll multiply 2 by 3, and that gives me 6.

Now, I have 8 and 6, and I need to add them together. So, 8 + 6 = 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, but I don't know why. I just know that's what my teacher said. So, I'll do the multiplication first.

3 * 2 = 6

Now, I add 5 to 6 and get...

6 + 5 = 11

The answer is 11."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to follow some rules when doing math problems, but I'm not really sure what they are. I think I'm supposed to do stuff inside parentheses first, then exponents, then multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction. But I'm not really sure what order those last two are in.

So, for this problem, 7 * 2 + 8 * 5, I think I'll just do what makes sense to me. I'll start by multiplying 7 and 2, because that's what I'm supposed to do first, right? That gives me 14. Then, I'll multiply 8 and 5, and that gives me 40. After that, I'll add 14 and 40, which gives me 54.

So, the answer is 54.

I hope that's right! If not, can someone please help me understand what I did wrong?","GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

So, the problem is 7 * 2 + 8 * 5. I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll start by multiplying 7 and 2. That gives me 14.

Next, I'll multiply 8 and 5. That gives me 40.

Now, I add 14 and 40, which gives me 54.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Okay, so we have this big problem with lots of numbers and symbols. Let's see... we have a 7 and a 2, and then a plus sign, and then an 8 and a 5. Hmmm... I know we have to follow some rules when we do math, but I don't know what they are called. Oh wait, I remember! My teacher said something about doing things in a special order. Let's see... we have to do the things inside the parentheses first, then the exponents, then the multiplication and division, and finally the addition and subtraction. Wow, that's a lot to remember!

Okay, so let's start with the inside stuff. We have a 7 and a 2, and we have to multiply them together. That's easy! 7 x 2 = 14. Now we have to add 8 and 5. That's easy too! 8 + 5 = 13. Oh, wait! I think we're supposed to do the multiplication before the addition. Oops! Okay, let's try again.

We have 7 * 2 = 14, and then we have 8 * 5 = 40. Whoa, that's a big number! Now we have to add 14 and 40. Hmmm... that's a little tricky, but I think we can do it. 14 + 40 = 54!

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Okay! So, we have a big multiplication problem. Let's start by multiplying the first two numbers together. 7 * 2 = 14. Now, we have to multiply 8 by 5, which is 40. Finally, we add 14 and 40 which gives us... 54! The answer is 54."
