So, the problem is 4*(2+5)+12-2*3, right?

First, I think we should do the multiplication. That's what the * symbol means, right? So, 4*2 is 8 and 4*5 is 20. Add them together and we get 28.

Next, we have 12. That's just a number, so we can add it to 28 and get 40.

Now, there's this minus sign (-) thingy. I think it means we have to subtract something. So, we have to subtract 2 times 3, which is 6.

But wait, there's more! We have to do something called ""order of operations"" apparently. That means we have to follow some rules. So, we have to do everything inside the parentheses first. That means we have to add 2 and 5 before we can multiply by 4.

Okay, so 2+5 is 7. Now we can multiply 4 by 7, which is 28.

So, the final answer is... (drumroll) 40 - 6 = 34!

But then I'm supposed to do something with the 4 and the 5. I think I'm supposed to multiply them. Is that right? So, 4 x 5 = 20.

So, the answer is 20.

The answer is 20."

I think we're supposed to do the multiplication first, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 2+5. That gives me 4*7 = 28.

Next, I think I'm supposed to add 12, so I'll add 12 to 28, which gives me 40.

Finally, I'm supposed to subtract 2 times 3, which is 6. So, I'll subtract 6 from 40, which gives me 34.

The answer is 34."

Okay, so I have 5 + 3*2. I know I need to do the multiplication first, so I'll do 3*2, which is 6. Then, I have 5 + 6, which is 11.

The answer is 11!"
