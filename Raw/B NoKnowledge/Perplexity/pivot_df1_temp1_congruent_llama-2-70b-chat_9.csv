Okay, so we have 5 + 2*4... Hmmm... I think I know how to do this!

First, I'll do the multiply part. 2 times 4 is 8. Cool!

Now, I'll add 5 and 8. That's 13!

The answer is 13.

I hope that's right! Do you think I did it correctly? Can you explain this PEMDAS thing to me?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that when we have multiplication and addition in a problem, we do the multiplication first. So, let's do the multiplication parts: 7*2 = 14 and 8*5 = 40.

Now, we add 14 and 40, and that gives us... 54!

The answer is 54."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, so we have 4*3, that's like, 4 groups of 3, which is 12, right?

And then we have 2, that's like, 2 more things.

So, if we add 12 and 2, we get... 14!

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Hey, I'm just a grade 6 student, I don't know much about this order of operations thing. But let's see...

Okay, so we have 4 times 2 plus 5, that's 4 times 7, which is 28.

Then we have 12, that's just 12.

Next, we have 2 times 3, that's 6.

So, we have 28 + 12 - 6, that's 34.

The answer is 34.

I hope that's right! Can someone please tell me if I did it correctly?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you explain it to me?

Oh, you want me to solve the problem anyway? Okay, let me try.

I think I need to add 5 and 3 first, so that's 8. Then, I need to multiply 3 by 2, which is 6. So, the answer is 8 + 6, which is 14.

The answer is 14.

I hope that's right! Do I get a sticker?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not really sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But, I'll give it a try!

So, the problem is 5 + 2*4, right? I think I know how to do this!

First, I'll add 5 and 2, that's easy! 5 + 2 = 7.

Next, I need to multiply 2 by 4. I know how to do that! 2 x 4 = 8.

Now, I need to add 7 and 8. That's easy too! 7 + 8 = 15.

The answer is 15!

I hope that's right! ðŸ˜…"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I've got this math problem and I'm supposed to use this thing called PEMDAS. I'm not really sure what it means, but I think it's like a secret code or something.

Okay, so the problem is 7*2 + 8*5. First, I'm gonna do the multiplication. 7*2 is 14, and 8*5 is 40. Now, I'm supposed to add them together, but I'm not sure which one to add first. Uh, oh well, I'll just add 14 and 40 together, and that's... 54!

So, the answer is 54. Yeah, I know it's not a secret code or anything, but it's still a pretty cool number, right?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I've got this math problem and I'm supposed to use this thing called PEMDAS. I don't really know what it means, but I think it's like a secret code or something.

Okay, so the problem is 4*3 + 2. I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, right? So, 4 times 3 is 12. Then, I add 2 and get 14.

The answer is 14.

I hope that's right! Can someone please tell me what PEMDAS stands for?"

Oh, you want me to try anyway? Okay, I'll do my best.

4 * 2 + 5 + 12 - 2 * 3

I think I should multiply 4 and 2 first, so that's 8.
Then I add 5, so that's 13.
Next, I add 12, so that's 25.
Finally, I subtract 2 times 3, which is 6.

The answer is 19.

Is that right? Did I do it correctly? Can you please explain PEMDAS to me now?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

So, the problem is 5 + 3*2. I think I should start by adding 5 and 3, that's 8. Now, I don't know what this * thing means, but I think it's like repeated addition. So, I'll add 3 and 2 together, that's 5.

Now, I have 8 and 5, and I'm not sure what to do next. I think I should add them together, so that's 13.

The answer is 13.

Okay, first, I think we should do the multiplication. That's the trickiest part, right? So, 2 times 4 is 8. Got it! 

Now, we have 5 + 8. This is easy! 5 + 8 is 13! 

The answer is 13. ðŸ˜Š"

llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let's see... I know I have to follow some rules when doing math, but I'm not sure what they are called. I think it's something like ""Do the multiplication first, then do the addition."" So, I'll start by multiplying 4 and 3, which gives me 12. Then, I'll add 2 to 12, which gives me 14.

First, I see a multiplication sign, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 2 + 5. That gives me 4 * 7 = 28.

Next, I see another multiplication sign, so I'll multiply 28 and 12. That gives me 336.

Now, I see a subtraction sign, so I'll subtract 2 times 3 from 336. That gives me 336 - 6 = 330.

The answer is 330!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this problem for a moment. Okay, I know that the plus sign comes before the multiplication sign, so I'll start by adding 5 and 3. That gives me 8. Next, I'll multiply 8 by 2, which gives me 16. The answer is 16!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication before the addition, but I don't know why. Can someone please explain it to me?

Okay, so I have 2*4, that's 8. Then I have 5+8, that's 13.

The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Okay, let me think...

So, first let's do the multiplication. 7 times 2 is... hmm... 14! And 8 times 5 is... wow, that's 40!

Okay, so the problem is 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3. Let's start by multiplying 4 and (2 + 5): that gives us 4*7 = 28.

Next, we add 12 to that: 28 + 12 = 40.

Now, we have to subtract 2 times 3, which is 6. So, 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34!"

Anyway, let's see... 3 times 2 is 6, right? So, if we write that down, we get 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11.

Can someone please tell me why we do the multiplication first? I don't get it."
