Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 multiplication symbol. I know that means I have to multiply 4 and what's inside the parentheses.

Inside the parentheses, I see 2+5. I know I have to add those numbers first. So, 2+5 is 7.

Now, I multiply 4 and 7, and that gives me 28.

Next, I see the addition symbol (+) and the number 12. I add 28 and 12, and that gives me 40.

Finally, I see the subtraction symbol (-) and the number 2 times 3, which is 6. I subtract 6 from 40, and that gives me 34.

The answer is 34.

First, I see some numbers and symbols that I know how to handle. Let's start with the easiest part: 2+5. I know how to add those numbers, so I'll do that first. 2+5 equals 7.

Next, I see 4*7. I know how to multiply, so I'll do that next. 4 times 7 is 28.

Now, I see 12. That's a number, so I'll just leave it alone for now.

Finally, I see 2*3. I know how to multiply, so I'll do that last. 2 times 3 is 6.

Now, let's add up all the numbers I have: 28, 12, and 6. That's 46!

The answer is 46."
