Okay, so in this problem, there are a few things going on. There's a 5, a 2, a 4, and some multiplication and addition symbols. I think you're supposed to do the multiplication first, so let's see... 2 times 4 is 8!

Now, there's this thing called ""order of operations"" that says you gotta do the multiplication before the addition. So, we've got 8 from the multiplication, and now we need to add 5 and 2. That's easy - 5 plus 2 is 7!

First, I multiply 4 and 3, which gives me 12.

Then, I add 2 to 12, which gives me 14.

The answer is 14."

First, we have to do the things inside the parentheses. That's just how it works. So, we have 2+5, which is 7.

Next, we multiply 4 by 7, which is 28.

Then, we have 12 - 2 times 3, which is 12 - 6, which is 6.

Finally, we add 28 and 6, which is 34.

The answer is 34."
