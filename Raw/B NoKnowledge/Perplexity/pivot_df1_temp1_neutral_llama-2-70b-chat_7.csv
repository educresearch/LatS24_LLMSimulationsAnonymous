llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think... Ok, I know I need to follow some steps to solve this problem. I think it's something like ""PEMDAS""... I'm not sure what it means, but I know it helps me solve problems like this.

So, first, I'll do the multiplication. 2 times 4 is 8.

Next, I'll add 5 and 8. That's 13.

The answer is 13!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this ""order of operations"" thing is all about. But I'll give it my best shot!

Okay, so the problem is 7*2+8*5. I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll do the multiplication first.

7*2 = 14
8*5 = 40

Now, I add 14 and 40, which gives me... 54!

The answer is 54.

I hope that's right! Do I get a sticker? ðŸ˜„"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 3. That gives me 12.

Then, I have 2 left over, so I'll add that to 12.

The answer is 14.

Can you help me check if that's right?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Okay! Let me try my best to solve this problem.

First, I see some numbers that are inside parentheses, so I need to follow the rule that says ""Do whatever is inside the parentheses first!""

Inside the parentheses, I see 2+5. Let me see... 2+5 is equal to 7.

Now, I see 4 times 7, that's 28.

Next, I see 12. That's easy, 12 is just 12!

Finally, I see 2 times 3. That's 6.

Now, I need to do some subtracting. 28 - 6 is equal to 22.

The answer is 22!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I can give it a try!

Okay, so the first thing I would do is add 5 and 3, because that's what the problem says. So, 5 + 3 = 8.

But then I see that there's a multiplication symbol there, so I think I have to do that next. So, 8 Ã— 2 = 16.

So, the answer is 16!

The answer is 16."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm trying to solve this math problem, and I'm not really sure how to do it. I know I need to follow some rules, but I don't know what they are. I think I need to do the multiplication first, so I'll start by multiplying 2 and 4. That gives me 8. Then, I need to add 5 and 8, which gives me 13. The answer is 13!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Hi there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

First, I think I should multiply 7 and 2, because that's what the problem says to do. So, 7*2 = 14.

Next, I see that there's a plus sign, so I think I should add something. There's a 5 nearby, so I'll add 5 to 14. That gives me 19.

Finally, I see that there's an 8 hiding over there, and it looks like it wants to be multiplied by something. I think I should multiply 8 by 5, because that's what the problem says to do. So, 8*5 = 40.

Now, I have a choice to make. Should I add 40 to 19, or should I add 19 to 40? I'm not sure what the right thing to do is, but I think I'll add 19 to 40, because that seems like the right way to do it. So, 40 + 19 = 59.

The answer is 59!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a 6th grader and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

So, the first thing I see is the multiplication sign, which means I have to multiply 4 and 3. That gives me 12.

Next, I see the plus sign, and I know that means I have to add something. In this case, it's 2. So, I add 2 to 12 and get 14.

The answer is 14.

PEMDAS? Never heard of it! But I hope that's the right answer! ðŸ˜…"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm trying to solve this math problem, and I'm not sure what to do. It looks like this: 4*(2+5)+12-2*3.

First, I think I should follow the order of operations. That means I should do anything that's inside parentheses first. So, I'll start by adding 2 and 5, which gives me 7.

Next, I'll multiply 4 by 7, which gives me 28.

Then, I'll add 12 to 28, which gives me 40.

Finally, I'll subtract 2 times 3, which gives me 40 - 6, which is 34.

The answer is 34.

I hope that's right! Can someone please check my work?"

So, 5+3*2 means we have to add 5 and 3 times 2, right? That's what the multiplication symbol means, doesn't it?

Okay, so 3 times 2 is 6. Now, we add 5 and 6, which gives us 11.

The answer is 11!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Okay, so we have this math problem: 5+2*4.

First, we need to do the multiplication. 2 times 4 is 8.

So, now we have 5 + 8.

Next, we add 5 and 8, and that gives us 13.

The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know I have to do the multiplication first, so I'll start with the 7*2. That's easy, it's 14.

Next, I have to do the 8*5. That's a little harder, but I know it's 40.

Now, I have to add 14 and 40 together. That's easy, it's 54.

So, the answer is 54!

The answer is 54."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Well, I know that when we do math, we usually start with the numbers that are multiplied together. So, I think we should start by multiplying 4 and 3 together. That gives us 12. Then, we add 2 to 12, and that gives us 14. So, the answer is 14.

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Oh, wow! That's a tricky question! Let me think...

Okay, first, we have 4 times 2 plus 5, that's 4 times 7, which is 28.

Then, we have 12. That's easy!

Next, we have 2 times 3. That's 6.

Now, we have to subtract 6 from 28. That's... hmm... 22!

llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what this ""PEMDAS"" thing is, but I can try to solve the problem.

First, I would add 5 and 3, because that's what the problem says: 5 + 3 = 8.

Then, I would multiply 2 by 3, because that's what the problem says next: 3*2 = 6.

So, if I add 8 and 6, I get 14.

The answer is 14!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Okay! So, we have this problem: 5+2*4.

First, we need to do the multiplication. 2 times 4 is 8.

Now, we add 5 and 8. 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Okay! Let's see... 7*2 means we have to multiply 7 and 2, which gives us 14. Then, we have 8*5, which is 8 multiplied by 5, and that's 40. After that, we add 14 and 40, which gives us... (counting on fingers) 54! The answer is 54. ðŸ˜Š"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know that when we have lots of numbers and symbols in a math problem, we need to follow some rules to make sure we do the right operations in the right order. I think it's like a recipe for cooking, we need to follow the steps in the right order or it won't turn out right!

So, the first thing I do is look for any multiplication symbols, and I see that there's a 4 and a 3 multiplied together. That means I need to do that first, so I multiply 4 and 3 and get 12.

Next, I look for any addition symbols, and I see that there's a plus sign between the 12 and the 2. So, I add 12 and 2 and get 14.

That's it! The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Okay, let's see...

First, we have 4 times something, and that something is 2+5. That's 2 plus 5, which is 7. So, 4 times 7 is 28.

Next, we have 12. That's just a number, so we can't do anything to it. It's just 12.

After that, we have minus 2 times 3. That's 2 times 3, which is 6. But then we have to subtract 6 from 28, and that gives us 22.

So, the answer is 22.

The answer is 22."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, but I don't know why. It just says so in the question. So, I'll do 3*2 and that's 6. Then, I'll add 5 and 6 and that's 11. The answer is 11."
