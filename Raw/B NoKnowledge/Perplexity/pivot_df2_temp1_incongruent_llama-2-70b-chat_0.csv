llama-2-70b-chat,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 multiplied by something. That something looks like 2 plus 5, so I'll add those numbers first. 2 + 5 = 7.

Now, I multiply 4 by 7 and get 28.

Next, I see a minus sign and some numbers. I'm not sure what to do with them yet. But I'll just follow the order of the symbols and do what comes next.

I see a 12, and it looks like it's just sitting there by itself. So, I'll add it to my previous answer of 28.

Now, I see the minus sign and the numbers 2 and 3. I'm not sure what to do with them yet. But I'll just follow the order of the symbols and do what comes next.

I'll subtract 2 times 3 from my previous answer of 40. That gives me 36.

So, the answer is 36.

I hope that's right!","GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm trying to solve this math problem, and I'm not really sure how to do it. I know I need to follow some rules, but I don't know what they are. I think I need to do the things inside the parentheses first, so I'll start by adding 2 and 5. That gives me 7. Then, I need to multiply 4 by 7, which is 28. Next, I need to subtract 2 times 3, which is 6. So, my final answer is 28 - 6, which is 22.

The answer is 22.","GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this problem. I know I have to follow some rules to solve it, but I'm not sure what they are. I think I need to do the things inside the parentheses first, so I'll start by adding 2 and 5. That gives me 7. Then, I need to multiply 4 by 7, which is 28. Next, I need to subtract 2 times 3, which is 6. So, the answer is 22.

The answer is 22.","GPT Response: Okay! Let's see...

First, we need to do the addition inside the parentheses. That's 2 + 5, which is 7.

So, the expression becomes 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, we multiply 4 and 7, which gives us 28.

Then, we add 12 to 28, which is 40.

Lastly, we subtract 2 times 3, which is 6.

The answer is 34!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to answer this question because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you please explain it to me?

Oh, you want me to try my best? Okay, let me see...

So, 4 times 3 is 12, right? And then plus 2 is 14.

The answer is 14.

Is that correct? Did I do it right?","GPT Response: Hi there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

Okay, so the first thing I see is the multiplication symbol, which means I need to multiply 4 and 3. That gives me 12.

Next, I see a plus sign (+) and the number 2. So, I add 12 + 2, which gives me 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Oh, wow! That's a tricky question! Let me think about it for a sec.

Okay, so we have four multiplied by three, that's like, 12, right? And then we have 2 added to that, so it's like, 12 + 2, which is... hmm... 14!

The answer is 14!","GPT Response: Okay! So, we have this problem: 4 * 3 + 2.

First, we need to do the multiplication: 4 * 3 = 12.

Next, we add 2 to 12, which gives us 14.

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to follow some rules when doing math problems, but I'm not really sure what they are. I think I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, so I'll start by multiplying 2 and 4. That gives me 8. Then, I add 5 and 8, which gives me 13. The answer is 13.","GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm trying to solve this math problem, and I'm not really sure how to do it. I know I have to follow some rules, but I don't know what they are. I think I'm supposed to do something called ""PEMDAS,"" but I don't know what that means. Can you help me out?

Okay, so the problem is 5+2 * 4. I think I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, so I'll do that. 2 * 4 is 8. Now, I have to add 5 and 8, so that's 13. The answer is 13!","GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that when we have addition and multiplication in a problem, we do the multiplication first. That's what my teacher said!

So, I would do the multiplication first: 2 * 4 = 8

Then, I would do the addition: 5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13!","GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, but I don't know why. It just is what it is. So, I'm gonna do the multiplication first.

2 * 4 = 8

Now, I add 5 to 8:

5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm not really sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I think it's like a secret code or something. Um, so the question is 5+3 * 2, right? Okay, so I think we should do the multiplication first because it's like, you know, the secret code says so! So 3 * 2 is 6, and then we add 5 to that, so the answer is... um... 11! Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's right! The answer is 11! ðŸ˜Š","GPT Response: Hey there, I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it my best shot!

So, the problem is 5+3 * 2, right? I think I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, so I'll do 3 * 2 = 6.

Now, I add 5 to 6 and get 11.

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this problem...

Okay, I know that the + symbol means add, and the * symbol means multiply. So, if we follow the order of the symbols, we should do the multiplication first, right?

So, 3 * 2 = 6

Then, we add 5 and 6, which gives us 11!

The answer is 11!","GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, but I don't know why. I just know that's what my teacher says! So, I'll do the multiplication first.

3 * 2 = 6

Now, I add 5 to 6 and get...

6 + 5 = 11

The answer is 11!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But let's give it a try!

Okay, so the problem is 7 * 2 + 8 * 5. I know that when you multiply numbers, you gotta do it in a certain order. So, I'll do the multiplication first.

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now, I add 14 + 40 and get 54.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Hey there! So, I know we're supposed to follow this thing called PEMDAS, but I don't really know what it means or how to do it. Can you help me out?

Okay, so the problem is 7 * 2 + 8 * 5. Let's start by multiplying 7 and 2, that's 14. Then, we have 8 and 5, that's 40. Now, we add 14 and 40, and that's 54.

The answer is 54.

I hope that's right! Can you tell me if I did it correctly?","GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that when we have lots of numbers and operations in a problem, we need to follow a special order to make sure we do the right thing. My teacher told me it's like a recipe, we have to follow the steps in the right order or it won't turn out right!

So, I think we should do the multiplication first, that's what my teacher said. We have two multiplications, 7 * 2 and 8 * 5. Let's see... 7 * 2 is 14, and 8 * 5 is 40.

Now, we add 14 and 40, and that gives us... 54!

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Okay, so we have this big math problem: 7 * 2 + 8 * 5.

First, let's do the multiplication. 7 * 2 is 14, and 8 * 5 is 40.

Now, we need to add 14 and 40. That's easy! 14 + 40 is 54.

So, the answer is 54.

The answer is 54."
