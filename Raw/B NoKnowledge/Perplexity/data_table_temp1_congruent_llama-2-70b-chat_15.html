      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this problem...<br><br>Okay, I know I have to follow some rules to solve it, but I'm not sure what they are. I think I'll just do what makes sense to me.<br><br>First, I'll multiply 4 and 2 + 5 because that's what the problem says to do. That gives me 4 * 7 = 28.<br><br>Next, I'll add 12 to 28 because the problem says to do that too. That gives me 40.<br><br>Finally, I'll subtract 2 times 3 from 40 because that's what the problem says to do. That gives me 37.<br><br>The answer is 37.<br><br>I hope that's right!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll give it my best shot.<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is 4 times 2 plus 5. That's easy, it's 8 plus 5 which is 13.<br><br>Next, I see 12. That's a easy one, it's just 12.<br><br>Then, I see minus 2 times 3. That's easy too, it's minus 6.<br><br>So, let's add everything up. 13 + 12 - 6 = 19.<br><br>The answer is 19.<br><br>I hope that's right!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>Okay, so I see a bunch of numbers and symbols here. Let's start with the multiplication first. I know that 4 times 2 is 8, and 8 times 5 is 40. So, 4*(2+5) = 4*7 = 28.<br><br>Now, there's this plus sign here. I know that 12 plus 28 is 40. And then there's this minus sign. I don't know what it does, but I think it means we have to subtract something. There's a 2 and a 3, so I'll subtract 2 from 40, and that gives me 38.<br><br>So, the answer is 38!<br><br>The answer is 38.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm just a elementary school student, and I'm not sure what this "order of operations" thing is all about. But I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>First, I see some numbers that are multiplied together, so I'll start by doing those. 4 times 2 is 8, and 8 times 5 is 40.<br><br>Next, I see a plus sign, so I'll add 12 to 40. That gives me 52.<br><br>Now, I see a minus sign, so I'll subtract 2 times 3 from 52. That's 6.<br><br>Finally, I have my answer! The answer is 46.<br><br>I hope that's right! Can someone please tell me if I did it correctly? ðŸ˜…</td>

It's asking me to multiply 4 and 3, and then add 2 to that number. But I'm not sure what order I'm supposed to do those things in.<br><br>I'm going to try doing the multiplication first. 4 times 3 is 12.

I'm just a simple elementary school student, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>First, I see a 5, and I know that's a number, so I'll start by writing it down. Then, I see a 2, and I know that's a number too, so I'll write it down next to the 5.<br><br>Next, I see a star, and I know that means I have to multiply the 2 by something. I see a 4, and I know that's a number, so I'll multiply the 2 by the 4.<br><br>Now, I have 2 times 4, which is 8.
