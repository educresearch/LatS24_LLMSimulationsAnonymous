mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: I would solve the problem step by step. First, I would do the operations inside the parentheses, then I would do the multiplication and division from left to right, and finally, I would do the addition and subtraction from left to right.

4 \* (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 \* 3
= 4 \* 7 + 12 - 2 \* 3 (add 2 and 5 inside the parentheses)
= 28 + 12 - 2 \* 3 (multiply 4 and 7)
= 28 + 12 - 6 (multiply 2 and 3)
= 40 - 6 (add 28 and 12)
= 34 (subtract 6 from 40)

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Hi, I'm a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS). I will try my best to solve this problem step-by-step.

First, I will do the operations inside the parentheses:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Then, I'll do the multiplication:

28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, I'll do addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: I would follow the numbers and operations in the order they are given, doing the operations from left to right. This means I would first add 2 and 5, then multiply the result by 4, add 12, and finally subtract 2 times 3.

So, I would calculate as follows:

(2 + 5) = 7
4 \* 7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2 \* 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: I don't know about order of operations, but I remember my teacher saying something about doing calculations in parentheses first. So let's solve it step by step:

1. Calculate what's inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7
2. Then, do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6
3. After that, add and subtract in order: 28 + 12 = 40, 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: As a 6th grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first guess that you should do the operations from left to right. So I would first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12, then add 2 to get 14. However, I recently learned that there is a rule called PEMDAS that says you should do parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right) in that order. But for this problem, there are no parentheses, exponents, or division, so the rule doesn't really apply. So I would still say that the answer is:

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about order of operations (PEMDAS), I will just solve this by doing the operations from left to right.

First, I will multiply 4 and 3. That gives me 12.

Then, I will add 2 to 12. That gives me 14.

So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the multiplication and addition from left to right. 

First, I would multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then, I would add 2 to 12.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I would first solve the multiplication problem since I learned that multiplication is just like adding groups of numbers together. So, I would do 4 times 3 which equals 12. Then, I would add the 2 to that result because there are no more multiplication or addition problems left. So, 12 plus 2 equals 14. Therefore, the answer is 14."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: As a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think about just doing the operations from left to right. But I have heard about this rule that we need to follow, so let me figure it out.

Order of operations is like this: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). In this question, there are no parentheses or exponents, so I'm looking for multiplication or division first, and then addition.

There is multiplication: 2*4. So I should do that part first. 2 times 4 is 8. Now the expression looks like this: 5 + 8.

Next, I do the addition: 5 plus 8 is 13.

So,

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the addition and multiplication from left to right.

So, I would first add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then, I would multiply that result by 4.

7 multiplied by 4 is 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: I don't know about any special rule called PEMDAS, but I have heard that sometimes you need to do multiplication before addition. If that's the case, then I would first multiply 2 and 4 to get 8, and then add 5 to get 13.

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: As a curious elementary school student who has just started learning about math, I would approach this problem by following the basic order of operations that I have been taught so far, which is to perform calculations in the following order: parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.

For the given expression 5 + 2*4, there are no parentheses or exponents involved. So, we move on to the next step, which is multiplication and division. We see that we have to multiply 2 by 4, giving us 8.

Now, our expression becomes 5 + 8. Finally, we do addition (since there are no more multiplication or division operations left), giving us a total of 13.

The answer is 13."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the addition part since that's what I see first. But I remember my teacher mentioning something about rules for doing operations in a certain order. I think we need to do the multiplication first, then the addition.

So, I'd do 3*2 first, which is 6.

Then I'd add that result, 6, to 5.

Doing that, I get 11.

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the addition and multiplication from left to right. So I would first add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then I would multiply 8 by 2 to get 16. So the answer is 16.

So,
5 + 3*2 = 8 + 4 = 16

The answer is 16.

(Note: The correct answer using order of operations or PEMDAS is 11, because you should do multiplication before addition. But since the persona I am pretending to be does not know about order of operations, I have given the answer in a way that would make sense to them.)","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations, I would first add 5 and 3 to get 8.

First, I would do 7*2, which equals 14. Then, I would do 8*5, which equals 40. Lastly, I would add the results, 14 + 40, to get 54.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Well, I don't know about any special rules like PEMDAS, but I know how to do multiplication and addition. I just need to figure out what to do first. Let's see...there are two operations here: multiplication and addition. But I remember my teacher saying something about doing calculations inside parentheses first, then exponents, then multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally addition and subtraction (from left to right). I guess that's called the order of operations.

So, for this problem, 7*2 + 8*5, I should do the multiplication parts first. 

7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40.

Now that I have those results, I can do the addition:

14 + 40 equals 54.
