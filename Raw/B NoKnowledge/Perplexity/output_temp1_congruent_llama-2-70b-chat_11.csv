Okay, I know that when we add numbers, we have to do it from left to right. So, the first number on the left is 5, and then there's a multiplication sign. That means we have to do the multiplication before we can add anything else.

So, 2 times 4 is 8. Now, we can add 5 and 8, and that gives us... 13!

Okay, let's see... In this problem, there are no parentheses, so we can skip that part. There are no exponents either, so we can move on to the multiplication and division part.

I see that there's a multiplication sign between 4 and 3, so I'll do that first. 4 multiplied by 3 is 12.

First, we have to do the multiplication: 4 * (2 + 5) = 4 * 7 = 28.

Next, we have to add 12: 28 + 12 = 40.

Finally, we have to subtract 2 times 3: 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34."
