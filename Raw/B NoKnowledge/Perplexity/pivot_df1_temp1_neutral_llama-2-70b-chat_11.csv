So, first I'll add 5 and 2, that's 7. Then, I'll multiply 4 by 2, that's 8.

So, the answer is 7 + 8 = 15.

The answer is 15."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm not really sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it my best shot.

Okay, so the first thing I see is the 7*2, which is equal to 14. Then, I see the 8*5, which is equal to 40.

So, if I add 14 and 40, I get 54.

The answer is 54! ðŸ˜Š"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: I've never heard of this PEMDAS thing, so I'll just do the math in the order that makes sense to me.

First, I'll multiply 4 and 3, which gives me 12.
Then, I'll add 2 to 12, which makes 14.

So, the answer is 14.

I know that's not how you're supposed to do it, but it's the only way I know how! Can you help me understand this PEMDAS thing?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm just a grade 6 student, and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

Okay, so I see a bunch of numbers and symbols here. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I see 4*. I know that means I have to multiply 4 by something. Oh, wait! There's a parentheses! It says 2+5. Hmm, I think I have to add 2 and 5 first. That's 7, right? So, 4*7 is... umm... 28!

Next, I see a plus sign (+). That means I have to add something else. Oh, there's a 12! So, 28 + 12 is... let me see... 40!

But wait, there's a minus sign (-) too! I have to subtract something. Uh-oh, it's 2 times 3! That's 6. So, 40 - 6 is... 34.

The answer is 34!

I hope that's right! Can someone tell me if I did it correctly?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that when we add numbers, we do it from left to right. So, first, I'll add 5 and 3, which gives us 8.

Next, I see that there's a multiplication sign, which means we have to multiply something. In this case, it's 3 and 2. I'm not sure what the answer to that is, but I think it's 6.

So, if I combine what I have so far, I get 8 + 6 = 14.

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I've got this math problem and I'm supposed to find the answer. It says 5+2*4. Now, I know that the * means multiplication, so I'm gonna do that part first. 2*4 is equal to 8, so now I have 5+8. Next, I need to add 5 and 8, which gives me 13. The answer is 13!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Hi there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure how to solve this problem using something called PEMDAS. Can you help me out?

Okay, so I know that 7*2 means 7 times 2, which is 14. And 8*5 means 8 times 5, which is 40.

Now, I'm not sure what to do next. I know I need to add 14 and 40, but I don't know what order to do it in. Can you tell me what to do?

Oh, I see! You're saying I should do the multiplication first, then add the two numbers together. That makes sense.

So, 7*2 is 14, and 8*5 is 40. If I add them together, I get 54.

The answer is 54!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?

Okay, so I know that 4 times 3 is 12. And then there's a plus sign, so I think that means I have to add something. There's a 2 after the plus sign, so I'll add 2 to 12. That makes 14.

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you explain it to me?

Oh, you want me to try my best? Okay, let's see...

I think I should start by multiplying 4 and 2+5 because it's inside parentheses. That gives me 4*7 = 28.

Next, I see a plus sign, so I think I should add 12 to 28, which gives me 40.

Finally, I see a minus sign, so I think I should subtract 2 times 3 from 40, which gives me 36.

The answer is 36.

I hope that's correct!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Sure! I'm happy to help.

So, we have this math problem: 5+3*2

First, I know that 3*2 is 6, so I can write that down.

5 + 6 = 11

So, the answer is 11.

The answer is 11."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what this ""PEMDAS"" thing is, but I know how to do addition and multiplication!

So, first, I would add 5 and 2, which gives me 7.

Then, I would multiply 4 by 7, which gives me 28.

Therefore, the answer is 28.

The answer is 28."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this problem for a moment. Okay, I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll start by multiplying 7 and 2 together. That gives me 14. Next, I'll multiply 8 and 5 together, and that gives me 40. Then, I'll add 14 and 40 together, and that gives me 54. The answer is 54!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm just a simple elementary school student, and I'm not sure what this ""order of operations"" thing is all about. But I'll do my best to solve this problem.

Okay, so I see a bunch of numbers here: 4, 3, 2. I know I need to multiply 4 and 3, so I do that first.

4 Ã— 3 = 12

Now, I see that there's a plus sign, so I add 2 to 12.

12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?

Okay, I see that there are lots of numbers and symbols in the problem. Let me try to break it down.

First, I see a 4 and a 2. I know that 4 times 2 is 8.

Next, I see a + sign and a 5. I know that 8 + 5 is 13.

Then, I see a ) symbol. I'm not sure what that means, but I think it means I should do the next step.

After that, I see a 12. I know that 13 + 12 is 25.

Finally, I see a - sign and a 3. I know that 25 - 3 is 22.

So, the answer is 22!

The answer is 22."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Okay, so we have this math problem: 5+3*2.

First, let's start with the multiplication part, which is 3*2. That's easy, it's 6!

Now, we have 5+6, which is 11.

So, the answer is 11!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, but I don't know why. I just know that's how we do it. So, I'll do the multiplication first. 2 times 4 is 8. Now, I add 5 and 8, and that's 13. The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Okay, let's see...

First, I know that when we have multiplication, we have to do it before addition. That's what my teacher told me!

So, I'll do the multiplications first:

7*2 = 14
8*5 = 40

Now, I add 14 and 40:

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54!"

4 times 3 is 12.

Now, I'm supposed to add 2 to that, so...

12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Okay! Let's see...

First, we have to do the stuff inside the parentheses. That's 2+5, which is 7.

So, now we have 4*7. That's 28.

Next, we have 12.

After that, we have 2*3, which is 6.

Finally, we subtract 6 from 28, and that gives us 22.

The answer is 22!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Okay! Let's see... 5 plus 3 is 8, and 8 times 2 is 16. So, the answer is 16.

The answer is 16."
