I'd try to solve this problem by doing the operations in what I think is the simplest order. Here's my attempt:<br><br>1. I see the numbers inside parentheses, so I'll do that first: 2 + 5 = 7<br>2. Then I'll multiply: 4 * 7 = 28<br>3. After that, I'll subtract: 28 + 12 = 40<br>4. Finally, I'll do the last subtraction: 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>

This is called the order of operations or PEMDAS. For the given problem, I'd try both ways I know how to do the problem and then check which answer seems more logical. I'd first do the multiplication, then the addition:<br><br>4 * 3 = 12<br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>But, I also know that sometimes you have to do addition before multiplication. I'd better check which answer is correct.

      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I have not learned about the order of operations yet.

      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I've never learned about order of operations yet. But I can try to solve this problem by guessing which operation should be done first based on the usual way we learn math in school. So, I'll do the multiplication first, then add the numbers:<br><br>2*4 = 8<br><br>Now, add the numbers:<br><br>5 + 8 = 13<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm a grade 6 student, so I don't really know much about the order of operations in math yet. But let me try this problem out, I guess.<br><br>First, I see that there's addition and multiplication in the expression. According to what I've learned so far, I think we should do the multiplication first, then the addition. So, I'll do 2 * 4 first. That gives me 8. <br><br>Now, I have 5 + 8. I think I can do that addition easily. So, 5 + 8 equals 13!<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a non-expert in mathematics order of operations, I would approach this problem by focusing on what the symbols represent. From left to right, I see there's an addition (5 +) and a multiplication (2*4). I remember that multiplication is typically performed before addition, as my teacher mentioned once. So, I would first do the multiplication: 2 * 4 = 8. Then I would substitute that result into the addition: 5 + 8. Performing the addition gives me the final answer: The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure what to do with this sum because I don't know the rules for order of operations yet. But I think I should do the multiplication first since it has a symbol (*) and then add the numbers. So, let's see what happens:<br><br>First, I'll do 2 multiplied by 4: 2 * 4 = 8<br>Now, I'll add 5 to the result I just got: 5 + 8<br><br>The answer is: 13. But I'll have to remember to ask my teacher about these rules so I can do it correctly all the time.</td>

I'm not quite sure what those rules are called, but I think I've heard something about parents, exponents, multiplication, division, and addition in a specific order. Let's see if we can apply that to this problem.<br><br>First, I see that there's a multiplication sign, so I think that needs to be done first. But before I do that, I need to know if there are any exponents involved. Since there are none in this problem, let's continue with the next rule: multiplication.<br><br>So, I'll do the multiplication: 3*2 equals 6.<br><br>Now, I have my problem simplified, and I only have addition left.
