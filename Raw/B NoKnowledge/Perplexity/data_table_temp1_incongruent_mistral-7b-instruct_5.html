      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations rule (PEMDAS). But, I've heard that some calculations need to be done before others because of certain rules. Let's try to tackle this problem step by step:<br><br>1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in this expression, so we'll move on to the next part.<br><br>2. Exponents: There are no exponents, so we'll continue.<br><br>3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right): There are two multiplication signs: 4 * (2+5) and 2 * 3. Let's do them one by one.<br><br>First, let's do the easy one: 2 * 3 = 6<br><br>Now, let's do 4 * (2+5). We need to add 2 and 5 inside the parentheses first: <br>4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28<br><br>4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). There's one addition (2+5) and one subtraction (-2) left.<br><br>The sum of 2 and 5 is 7. So, we have:<br>28 (from 4 * (2+5)) + 12 - 2 * 3<br>= 28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Lastly, let's do the addition and subtraction:<br>28 + 12 = 40<br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So, the answer is __.<br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a 6th grade student, I have not learned about the order of operations yet. I will just do the calculation from left to right and top to bottom.<br><br>First, I will do the parentheses: 2+5=7, so the equation becomes 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, I will do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28, 2 * 3 = 6.<br><br>Now, I will do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40, 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just a little student, and I don't know much about those letters you see in that math problem: "4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3". But I can tell you what I see: numbers and an operation sign.<br><br>So let's start with what's inside the parentheses: 2+5. I bet you that's supposed to be addition, so let's do that first. Seven, carry on!<br><br>Now I have 4 * 7. Hmm, what's this? I see a star, star means multiplication, right? Let's do that with the numbers we got: 28.<br><br>Add the 12: 28+12 makes 40. Now let's get the last part: -2 * 3. Minus sign isn't an operation we do first, but it means '="-"' times, so let's do this one last.<br><br>Three times (-2) equals -6. So, I can finally give you the answer:<br><br>The answer is 40 - 6.<br>Let's see, subtract 6 from 40, that's 34.<br>So the final answer is:<br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a beginner elementary school student, I would approach this math problem by following the order that the symbols appear from left to right. However, let's make it clearer by giving simple names to each part of the equation:<br><br>A = 4 * (2+5)<br>B = 12-2 * 3<br><br>Now, let's solve each part:<br><br>Part A:<br>Follow the multiplication first, so it becomes:<br>A = 4 * (2+5)<br>A = 4 * (7)<br>A = 28<br><br>Part B:<br>Since subtraction is done before multiplication (follow the order from left to right, but multiplication and division have the same precedence and are done before addition and subtraction), we need to do 12 - 2 * 3:<br>B = 12 - 2 * 3<br>B = 12 - 6<br>B = 6<br><br>The final answer:<br>The answer is A + B = 28 + 6 = 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I don't know about order of operations yet. I would try to solve the problem by doing the multiplication first, then adding the numbers. This is because I know that you usually learn to do multiplication before addition in math. So, I would do 2 * 4 which equals 8, and then add 5 to get the final answer.<br><br>The answer is: 5 + 8 = 13.<br><br>(However, please note that this answer is incorrect according to the order of operations rule, which is PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). The correct answer would be 5 + (2 * 4), which is equal to 5 + 8 = 13, but solved differently.)</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm a grade 6 student and I've never heard about this thing called PEMDAS or order of operations. But I do know that when it comes to solving a math problem, we usually try to follow a certain logic. I think we'll do the multiplication first since the asterisk * is there, then add the results to the number that comes before the multiplication. So let's first find 2 * 4: that's 8. Now add 5, and we have:<br><br>The answer is: 5 + 8 = 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a beginner student, I would approach this problem by doing the simple addition first, and then the multiplication. So, I would do 5 + 2 first, which equals 7. Then, I would do the multiplication part, which is 2 * 4. This makes 8. Therefore, the final answer would be the sum of these two parts, which is 7 + 8 = 15. The answer is 15.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I know that in mathematics we sometimes need to follow a specific rule to solve an equation correctly. But since I don't know what that rule is called, I'll try to solve this problem using what I think might make sense.Here's what I'd do: I'd first do the addition, then the multiplication. That is, I'd do 5 + (3 * 2). Hopefully, that's the right way to do it, but if not, please help me learn the correct rule so I can solve math problems like this one in the future!<br><br>The answer is _____.<br>[Without PEMDAS, the answer here isn't determined, as multiplication and addition have different precedence in the standard order.]</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I see there are some numbers and some symbols in front of me. The plus sign (+) and the multiplication sign (+) look the same, but they mean different things. I think I should do the multiplication first, because the multiplication sign is usually written above the addition sign in texts and problems. So, I'll do 3 * 2 which is 6.
