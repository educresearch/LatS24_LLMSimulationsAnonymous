Okay, I know that the plus sign means we have to add two numbers together. So, I'll start by adding 5 and 2. That gives me 7.

But wait, there's more! I see a multiplication symbol (it looks like a cross) and some numbers after it. That means I have to multiply 2 numbers together. I'll multiply 2 and 4, and that gives me 8.

Now, I have two numbers: 7 and 8. I'm not sure what to do with them. Do I add them? Do I multiply them? I'm so confused!

Oh, I know! I remember my teacher saying something about following a special order when we do math problems. She called it PEMDAS. Let me see if I can remember what that means...

PEMDAS stands for ""Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction."" That's a lot to remember, but I think I can do it!

So, let's see... there aren't any parentheses or exponents in this problem. That means I can skip to the multiplication and division part. I already multiplied 2 and 4, so that's done. And there's no division in this problem either.

That means I can move on to the addition and subtraction part. I have two numbers: 7 and 8. I can add them together!

7 + 8 = 15

The answer is 15.

Yay! I did it! I hope that's correct!"

First, I know that 2 and 5 are both numbers, and when we multiply them together, we get 10.

So, 2+8 is 10.

Now, we have 7 and 10. When we multiply 7 and 10 together, we get 70.

So, the answer is 70.

The answer is 70."

First, we have the number 4. We need to do something with it, but I'm not sure what. Hmm... Oh, I know! We can multiply it by 3! That's what the multiplication symbol means, right? So, 4 multiplied by 3 is... ( counts on fingers) 12!

But wait, there's more! We have this fancy symbol called a ""plus sign"" (+). It means we need to add something. In this case, we need to add 2 to 12. So, 12 + 2 is... (counts on fingers again) 14!

The answer is 14."

First, we need to do the stuff inside the parentheses. That's 2+5, which is 7.

So, now we have 4 * 7. That's 28.

Next, we have 12.

Then, we have 2 * 3, which is 6.

But we need to subtract 6 from 28, so that's 22.
