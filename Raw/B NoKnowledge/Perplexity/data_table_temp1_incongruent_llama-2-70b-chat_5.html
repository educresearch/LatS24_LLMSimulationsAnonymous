      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it my best shot.<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 multiplied by something. I don't know what that something is yet, but I'll come back to it.<br><br>Next, I see a bunch of numbers and operations that look like they're inside some parentheses. I think I'm supposed to do whatever is inside the parentheses first, so let's see...<br><br>There's a 2 and a 5, and they're added together. That's easy! 2 + 5 = 7.<br><br>Now, there's a 12. I don't know what to do with that yet, but I'll just leave it alone for now.<br><br>Oh, wait! I see a minus sign! That means I have to subtract something. There's a 2 and a 3, and they're multiplied together. That's easy too! 2 * 3 = 6.<br><br>Now, I have to subtract 6 from... hmm, what was that number again? Oh yeah, 12! So, 12 - 6 = 6.<br><br>Okay, I think that's everything! Let me check my work...<br><br>4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3<br>= 4 * 7 + 12 - 6<br>= 28 + 12 - 6<br>= 44 - 6<br>= 38<br><br>The answer is 38!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?<br><br>Okay, let's see... 4 times 2 is 8, and 8 plus 5 is 13. Then, 12 minus 2 times 3 is 12 minus 6, which is 6. So, the answer is 6.<br><br>The answer is 6.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm not sure what this thingamajig PEMDAS is, but I'll give it my best shot. So, we've got this math problem thingy that looks like this: 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3.<br><br>First, I think we should do the thing where we add 2 and 5 together. That's like, basic math, right? So, 2 + 5 = 7. Cool!<br><br>Next, we've got this thing where we multiply 4 by 7. That's easy! 4 * 7 = 28.<br><br>After that, we've got this other thing where we add 12 to 28. That's like, simple addition, right? 28 + 12 = 40.<br><br>Finally, we've got this last thing where we subtract 2 times 3 from 40. That's like, easy peasy, right? 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34. Ta-da!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, let me try to solve this problem!<br><br>First, I know that when we have parentheses, we need to do what's inside them first. So, I'll start by adding 2 and 5. That gives me 7.<br><br>Next, I need to multiply 4 by 7. That's easy - it's 28.<br><br>Now, I need to subtract 2 times 3. That's 6.<br><br>So, my final answer is 28 - 6, which is 22.<br><br>The answer is 22!</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm supposed to solve this math problem, right? It looks like this: 4 * 3+2.<br><br>Hmm, let me think... Okay, I know that the multiplication symbol, which looks like a big cross, comes first. So, I'll do that one first. 4 * 3 is... (counting on my fingers) 12!<br><br>Then, I see a plus sign (+) after the multiplication. That means I have to add something. Oh, I see! There's a 2 there. So, I'll add 12 + 2, which is... (counting on my fingers again) 14!<br><br>So, the answer is... (drumroll please) 14! Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's right. The answer is 14. Woohoo, I did it!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. I think it might be some kind of secret code that my teacher uses.<br><br>But, I think I can do the problem by just following the numbers. So, 4 times 3 is 12, and then if I add 2, it's 14.<br><br>So, the answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>Okay, so I see a bunch of numbers and symbols here. Let's start with the multiplication part. I know that 4 times 3 is 12, so I'll write that down.<br><br>Now, there's this plus sign and a 2. I'm not sure what to do with the 2, but I know that when you add something, you put the numbers together. So, I'll add 12 and 2, and that gives me 14.<br><br>The answer is 14!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, I'll give it a try!<br><br>So, first I think we should do the multiplication. That's what the * means, right? So, 4 * 3 is 12.<br><br>Next, we have the addition. That's what the + means, right? So, 12 + 2 is 14.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

I'm not sure what the * means, but I think it's like a multiplication sign.<br><br>So, I think the first thing I should do is add 5 and 2, and that gives me 7. Then, I see that there's a 4, and I think I should multiply 7 by 4, because that's what the * means, right?<br><br>So, 7 times 4 is... (thinks for a moment) ...28!<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, but I don't know why. Can someone explain it to me like I'm 10?<br><br>Okay, so imagine you have 2 groups of 4 apples. That's like 2 times 4, right? So, if you multiply 2 and 4, you get 8 apples. Now, if you add 5 more apples to that, you have a total of 13 apples!<br><br>The answer is 13. ðŸ˜Š</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...<br><br>Okay, I know that when we add numbers, we do it from left to right. So, first, I'll add 5 and 2, which gives me 7.<br><br>Now, there's this thing called "multiplication" that we do next. It's like repeated addition. So, I'll multiply 4 by 2, which gives me 8.<br><br>But then, there's this funny symbol called a "plus sign" that means we have to add some more. So, I'll add 7 and 8, which gives me... (counting on my fingers) 15!<br><br>The answer is 15.<br><br>Wait, what's that you say? There's a special order we're supposed to follow? Like, Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and then Addition and Subtraction?<br><br>Oh, I didn't know that! Maybe that's why my answer is different from what the teacher wrote on the board... Hmm, maybe I'll have to learn that PEMDAS thingy after all!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! Let's see... 5 + 2 is 7, and 7 * 4 is 28. So, the answer is 28.<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
