I remember now, we should do the operations in parentheses first, then exponents, then multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally addition and subtraction (from left to right). That's called PEMDAS.\n\nIn this problem, there aren't any parentheses or exponents, so I go to the next rule: multiplication. I see that there is a number multiplied by another number: 3*2. I should do that operation first.\n\n3*2 equals 6.\n\nNow, I replace 3*2 with 6, so the problem becomes: 5+6\n\nThen, I just have to add those numbers together:\n\n5+6 equals 11.\n\nThe answer is 11."}]}]
