llama-2-70b-chat,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll give it my best shot!

Okay, so the first thing I see is 4*2, which is 8. Then there's a plus sign and a 5, so that's 8+5, which is 13. Wait, there's more! There's a plus sign again and a 12. Hmm, 13+12 is 25.

Oh, but there's a minus sign and a 2*3, which is 6. So, 25 minus 6 is 19.

The answer is 19!","GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 multiplication symbol. I know that means I have to multiply 4 and the number that comes after it. The number after it is 2+5, so I'll do that first. 2+5 is equal to 7, so now I have 4 times 7, which is 28.

Next, I see the addition symbol (+) and the number 12. I know I have to add 12 to 28, so that's easy. 28 + 12 = 40.

Now, there's a subtraction symbol (-) and the number 2 times 3, which is 6. I have to subtract 6 from 40, so that's easy too. 40 - 6 = 34.

So, the answer is 34!

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Hey, I've never heard of this PEMDAS thingy, but I'll try my best to solve this math problem!

Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 multiplication symbol, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 2+5. That gives me 4 times 7, which is 28.

Next, I see the addition sign, so I'll add 12 to 28, which gives me 40.

Now, I see the subtraction sign, so I'll subtract 2 times 3 from 40. That's 2 times 3 is 6, so I'll subtract 6 from 40, which gives me 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34! üòÅ","GPT Response: Okay, let's see...

First, we need to do the multiplication: 4 * (2 + 5) = 4 * 7 = 28.

Next, we need to add 12: 28 + 12 = 40.

Finally, we need to subtract 2 times 3: 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 3. That gives me 12.

Next, I have 2 left over, so I'll add that to 12.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?

Okay, let me try. 4*3 is 12, right? And then there's a plus sign and a 2. So, 12 + 2 is 14. The answer is 14.

Is that right? Did I do it correctly?","GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this problem for a bit. Okay, I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 3. That gives me 12. Then, I'll add 2 to 12, which makes 14. So, the answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do something with these numbers, but I'm not sure what. Let me think...

Oh, I know! I can start by multiplying 4 and 3 together. That's easy, it's just 12.

Now, I have 12 + 2. That's easy too, it's 14.

The answer is 14!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that when we add numbers, we do it from left to right. So, first, I'll add 5 and 2, which gives me 7.

Next, I see that there's a multiplication symbol, which means I need to do that operation next. I'll multiply 4 by 2, which gives me 8.

Now, I need to add 7 and 8, which gives me 15.

The answer is 15.","GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. I think it might be a trick question, so I'll just do it the way that makes sense to me.

First, I'll add 5 and 2, which gives me 7.

Now, I'll multiply 4 by 2, which gives me 8.

I don't know what to do next, so I'll just add 7 and 8, which gives me 15.

The answer is 15.","GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that 5 plus 2 is 7, and 7 times 4 is 28.

So, the answer is 28!

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Okay, so we have this big complicated problem: 5+2*4. Let's see... 

First, we have the 5. That's easy. It's like, the number after 4. So, that's simple. 

Next, we have the 2. Now, that's a little trickier. It's like, the number after 1. But then, we have the *4. 

Hmm...what's that do? Well, it means we have to multiply 2 by 4. That's like...8! Yeah, because 2 times 4 is 8. 

So, put it all together, and we get...11! Yeah, because 5 plus 8 is 11. Therefore, the answer is 11!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it my best shot.

Okay, so the first thing I see is the 5. That's easy, it's just 5. Then I see the 3 and the 2, and I know I need to do something with them. I think I'm supposed to multiply them together, so that's what I'll do.

So, 3 times 2 is 6.

Now, I have 5 and 6. I'm not sure what to do next. I think I'm supposed to add them together, so that's what I'll do.

5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11.

I hope that's right! I'm not really sure what I'm doing, but I tried my best. Maybe next time I'll learn more about this PEMDAS thing and I'll be able to do it better.","GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm trying to solve this math problem, 5+3*2. I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best.

Okay, so I start by adding 5 and 3. That gives me 8. Then, I multiply 3 by 2, which is 6. So, now I have 8 + 6, which is 14.

The answer is 14.

I hope that's right! Can someone tell me if I did it correctly?","GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Therefore, the answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication part first, but I don't know why. I just know that's how we do it. So, I'll do 3*2 first. That's 6. Now, I have 5+6, and that's 11. The answer is 11."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Oh, wow! That's a tricky question! Let me think...

Okay, so I know that when we multiply numbers, we have to do it in a certain order. Like, if we have 2 numbers, we have to multiply the first number by the second number. So, in this case, we have 7 and 2, so we multiply 7 by 2 and that gives us... 14!

But wait, there's more! We also have 8 and 5. So, we have to multiply 8 by 5, and that gives us... 40!

Now, we have to add 14 and 40. So, 14 + 40 = 54!

The answer is 54!","GPT Response: Hey there! So, I know I'm supposed to do this math problem, but I'm not really sure how to do it. I've never heard of this PEMDAS thing before. Can someone help me out?

Okay, so I see that there are lots of numbers and symbols in the problem. I'm just gonna do what looks right to me.

First, I'll multiply 7 and 2. That gives me 14.

Next, I'll multiply 8 and 5. That gives me 40.

Now, I'll add 14 and 40. That gives me 54.

So, the answer is 54!

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

First, I know I have to do the multiplication part, so I'll start with that.

7 x 2 = 14
8 x 5 = 40

Now, I have to add these two numbers together.

14 + 40 = 54

So, the answer is 54!
