      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me understand what each letter stands for? Maybe we can break it down together and figure it out.<br><br>Oh, I see! So, P means parentheses, E means exponents, M means multiplication and division from left to right, and A means addition and subtraction from left to right. That makes sense!<br><br>Let's try to follow those steps for the problem 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3:<br><br>1. Parentheses: Inside the parentheses we have 2 + 5 = 7<br>2. Exponents: There are no exponents in this problem.<br>3. Multiplication and division from left to right: 4*7 = 28<br>4. Addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40<br>5. Finally, we subtract 2 times 3, which is 6: 40 - 6 = 34<br><br>The answer is 34.<br><br>I'm so glad I learned about PEMDAS! It really helped me solve this problem.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you explain it to me?<br><br>Okay, I understand now. So, I need to follow the order of operations:<br><br>1. Parentheses: inside the parentheses we have 2+5=7<br>2. Exponents (none in this case)<br>3. Multiplication: 4*7=28<br>4. Addition: 28+12=40<br>5. Subtraction: 40-2*3=40-6=34<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...<br><br>First, I know that I have to do the things inside the parentheses first. So, I'll start by adding 2 and 5. That gives me 7.<br><br>Next, I have to multiply 4 by 7. That gives me 28.<br><br>Then, I have to add 12 to 28. That gives me 40.<br><br>Finally, I have to subtract 2 times 3 from 40. That gives me 37.<br><br>The answer is 37.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! Let's see...<br><br>First, we have to do the things inside the parentheses. That means we have to add 2 and 5. My teacher taught me that when we add numbers, we have to do it in the correct order. So, we add 2 first and then 5. That gives us 7.<br><br>Now, we have to multiply 4 by 7. That's easy! 4 times 7 is 28.<br><br>Next, we have to add 12. That's simple! 28 + 12 is 40.<br><br>Finally, we have to subtract 2 times 3. That's 6. So, we subtract 6 from 40, and we get...<br><br>The answer is 34!</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to follow some rules when doing math problems, but I don't really know what they are. I think I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, so I'll do that.<br><br>4 times 3 is 12.<br><br>Now, I'm supposed to add 2 to that, right?<br><br>12 + 2 = 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! So, I know we're supposed to follow this thing called PEMDAS, but I don't really get it. I mean, I know it's like a set of rules or something, but I don't understand why we need to follow them. Can't we just do the math in any order we want? Like, I don't know, addition first, then multiplication? Or maybe multiplication first, then addition? That sounds pretty cool, right?<br><br>Okay, so let's try it out. For the problem 4*3 + 2, I'm gonna do the multiplication first. That's right, I'm a rebel! So, 4 times 3 is 12. Awesome, now I have my answer! But wait, there's more! We have this annoying little addition problem left over. Ugh, fine. So, 12 + 2 is... *drumroll* 14! The answer is 14. Yay, I did it!<br><br>(By the way, can someone please explain to me why we have to do the multiplication first? I don't get it. It just seems so... random. Like, why can't we do addition first and then multiplication? That would make way more sense, right? Someone enlighten me, please!)</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. I think it has something to do with following a special order when you do math problems, but I'm not sure what that order is. Can you help me?<br><br>Okay, let me try my best. I think I should do the multiplication first because that's what I was taught to do. So, 4 times 3 is 12. Then, I need to add 2 to 12, so that's 14. The answer is 14. Is that right?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do multiplication before addition, but I don't know why. Can someone please tell me why?<br><br>Okay, fine. So, I'll do the multiplication first. 4*3 is 12. Now, I have to add 2 to 12, which is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14. Can someone please tell me why we do multiplication before addition?</td>
