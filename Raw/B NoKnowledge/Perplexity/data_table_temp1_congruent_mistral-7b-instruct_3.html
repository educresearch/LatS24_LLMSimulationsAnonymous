      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what those funny letters mean in this equation, but my teacher said something about certain operations having to be done first. Let's see, there's multiplication and addition here. Normally, I'd do multiplication before addition because I've heard that's the rule, but I don't know why or what it's called. So, let's do the multiplication first:<br><br>4 * 3 = 12<br><br>Now, there's just addition left:<br><br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>So, the answer is:<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I've got this math problem here, and it says I should do 4 times 3 first, but then there's a plus sign after that! That means we add something, right? So, let's do 4 times 3, which is 12. Now, I've got 12, and 2. Hmm, I'm not quite sure what to do now. Maybe I should do the 2 first because it's a smaller number? But then, what about the 12? I think maybe I made a mistake. Let me try it another way. I'll do the multiplication first, then the addition. That makes more sense, right? So, I'll do 4 times 3, getting 12, and then add 2. That gives me an answer of 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS is or what order I'm supposed to do the operations in. I guess I could try doing the multiplication first and then the addition, but I'm not completely sure that's the right thing to do. So here's what I'll do:<br><br>First, I'll do the multiplication: 4 * 3 = 12<br><br>Next, I'll do the addition: 12 + 2 = 14<br><br>So, The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I see numbers and some symbols on this paper. I think they mean I should do the multiplication first and then add. So, I'll do 4 times 3, which equals 12. Now, I have 12 and 2. I guess I should add those numbers together. So, I'll put a 1 in front of 2 because when I add 1 to a number, it becomes 1 more than that number. Then I'll put the 2 next to the 1. So, 1 + 2 equals 3.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 15. (Note: According to standard order of operations or PEMDAS rule, the sum should be calculated after the multiplication, resulting in the final answer being 12 + 2 = 14. However, since I, as an elementary school student, am unaware of the order of operations rule, my response will be 15.)</td>

But I can still try to solve this problem by following the rules that I have learned so far. I will do the multiplication first because I know that you usually do multiplication before addition.

      <td>GPT Response: As a 6th grade student, I've learned how to do addition and multiplication, but I haven't learned the order of operations yet. When I see this equation, I'd usually do addition before multiplication because that's what feels natural to me. However, to find the correct answer, I need to follow the order of operations, which is a rule we follow to get the right answer, even if it might not be what comes first in our mind. According to this rule, multiplication should be done before addition. In this case, that means we first multiply 3 and 2 to get 6, and then we add 5 to that result:<br><br>5 + 3*2 = 5 + 6 = 11<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm an elementary school student and I don't know about this thing called PEMDAS yet. But I can tell you this: we usually do multiplication before addition. So I'd do the 3 multiplied by 2 first: that's 6. Then I'd add 5 to that: so 5 + 6 equals 11. The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm just a happy little elementary school student, and I don't know much about complicated math rules yet. But I can tell you this: When you see an addition sign (+) and a multiplication sign (*) together, you need to follow the rule called "PEMDAS" which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). It helps to make sure the order of operations is correct. In our case, multiplication comes before addition. So, we should first do 3*2 which equals 6. Then, add 5 to that result. Therefore, The answer is 5 + 3*2 = 11. Yay, math! (but I'm still learning!)</td>

But which one should I do first, the 7*2 or the 8*5? I don't know which one is easier to calculate first, so I'll just do one of them. I'll do 7*2. That gives me 14. Now, I have 14 and I need to add 8*5. Let's see, 8 times 5 is 40. So, I add 14 to 40. That gives me 54.<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
