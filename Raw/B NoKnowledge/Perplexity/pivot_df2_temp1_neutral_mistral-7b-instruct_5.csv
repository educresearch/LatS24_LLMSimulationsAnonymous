mistral-7b-instruct,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations rule (PEMDAS). However, I can try to solve this problem step by step based on what I think seems logical.

First, I will do the operation inside the parentheses:

2 + 5 = 7

Next, I will perform multiplication:

4 * 7 = 28

Then, I will do subtraction:

28 - 2 * 3

Now, according to my current understanding, multiplication comes before subtraction. So, I will first perform the multiplication:

28 - 6 * 3

Lastly, I will perform subtraction:

28 - 18 = 10

The answer is: __10__.

(Please note that this answer is incorrect because of the incorrect order I used to perform subtraction and multiplication operations. The correct answer is obtained by performing the multiplication first followed by the addition and subtraction.)","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I don't know about the order of operations yet. I'll just do the calculations following the simple rule: whatever has the symbol (parentheses, multiplication, division, addition, or subtraction) encounter it first and do that operation. I'll start with the parentheses.

First, I'll do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.
Now, I'll replace the parentheses with that result: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I'll look for the multiplication symbol and do that: 4 * 7 = 28, and 2 * 3 = 6.
Now, I'll replace those with the results: 28 + 12 - 6

Then, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40, and 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't know about order of operations yet. I would just follow the rule of doing the calculations in the order that they appear from left to right. Here's what I would do:

First, I would do the calculation inside the parentheses, which is 2+5, making it 7. Then, I would multiply 4 and 7, getting 28. After that, I would add 12 to 28, which makes 40. Lastly, I would subtract 2 from 40, leaving me with 38.

So, as a student without knowledge of order of operations, the answer would be: The answer is 38.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't know about order of operations yet. So, let's solve the given problem step by step, following the order in which the operations are written from left to right.

First, let's do the addition inside the parentheses:

2 + 5 = 7

Now, we have:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we'll do the multiplication:

4 * 7 = 28 (multiple of 4 and 7)
2 * 3 = 6 (multiple of 2 and 3)

Now, our equation looks like this:

28 + 12 - 6

Next, we will do the addition and subtraction from left to right:

12 + 28 = 40 (Sum of 12 and 28)
40 - 6 = 34 (Subtract 6 from 40)

The answer is: 34."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what those strange symbols mean, but my teacher told me to follow some rules when doing math problems. Let's see, there are these weird letters: P, E, MD, as, and S. Let's see which one applies here.

* The P stands for Parentheses, but there aren't any in this problem.
* E is for Exponents. We don't have any exponents either.
* MD stands for Multiplication and Division, and there's both here, so let's deal with those first.
* as is for addition and subtraction. Also present in this problem.
* S is for ""whatevers left,"" but let's see if there are other rules first.

Since we have Multiplication and Division, we should do those first, from left to right. So, let's do the 4*3 part:

12

Now, we have 12 and 2 left to deal with, which are addition and subtraction. Let's do this addition:

14

So, the answer is:

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Well, I've heard that we need to follow certain rules when doing math problems. But to be honest, I don't know what those rules are yet. So let's just do this multiplication first because it comes before addition in my head: 4 times 3 makes 12. Now I have 12, and I need to add 2. So 12 plus 2 makes 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS) yet. So, I would do the multiplication first, because I think that's what you do when you see numbers with asterisks (*) next to each other. Then, I would do the addition.

Here's how I would solve the problem:

First, I would do the multiplication: 4 * 3 = 12

Then, I would do the addition with the answer I just got and the number 2: 12 + 2

So, the final answer is: 12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Well, I see some numbers and symbols here. I think we need to follow the rules of mathematical operations. I'll do the multiplication first, because the level of my math teacher tells me that's what we should do before addition. So, 4 times 3 gives me 12. Now, I have 12 and 2. The addition comes last, so 12 plus 2 is equal to 14. The answer is __.

The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know the rule for the order of operations in mathematics yet. But, I think I can make a guess to get the answer. I'll do the multiplication first and then the addition. So, 2 multiplied by 4 equals 8. Then, I'll add 5 to 8. So, the answer is 13.

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: Well, I'm just a 6th grade student and I don't really know about this thing called PEMDAS or order of operations yet. But I can try to solve the problem based on what I think makes sense!

The expression 5+2*4 looks a bit confusing to me with those addition and multiplication signs there. So, I think I'll do the multiplication first since I've been told that sometimes it comes before addition.

Let's see...2 multiplied by 4 equals 8. So, now my expression looks like this: 5 + 8

Hmm...now there's an addition sign and a number in front of it. I guess I'll do the addition next then, right?

Well, when I add 5 and 8, I get 13! So, the answer to 5+2*4 is...

The answer is __13__.","GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this, the teacher wrote this problem on the board and it looks a bit confusing to me. There are numbers and symbols, but I don't remember what they mean or which one to do first. Maybe we can ask the teacher to explain it to us?

The answer is ___.

(Note: I couldn't provide a solution as I don't know the rules for order of operations)","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I have not learned the rule for order of operations in mathematics yet. So, let's do the multiplication first and then add, as it might look simpler that way to me.

First, I will do the multiplication: 2 * 4 = 8

Now, I will do the addition: 5 + 8

The answer is: 13.

So, the solution to the problem 5 + 2 * 4 is 13. But I should remember that in mathematics, we should always follow the order of operations: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). In this problem, it seems that following the simple ""do the multiplication first, then add"" rule leads to the same result, but that's just a coincidence."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I don't know much about order of operations yet. But I remember hearing that sometimes we need to do multiplication before addition. Let's try it out with the given problem: 5 + 3 * 2

First, we do the multiplication: 3 * 2 = 6

Then, we put the result of the multiplication, which is 6, in the place of the multiplication sign: 5 + 6

Lastly, we do the addition: 5 + 6 = 11

So, the answer is: The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Well, I'm just a grade 6 student, and we haven't learned about the order of operations yet. But I can tell you that my teacher sometimes tells us to do the multiplication before the addition, so let's give it a try!

So first, we'll do the multiplication:

3 * 2 = 6

Now, let's do the addition with the result we got:

5 + 6

Add the numbers:

11

So, The answer is 11.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't know about order of operations yet. So, I would do the multiplication first because the symbol for multiplication looks like little houses and I remember that Mom helps Dad when they build houses. Then I would do the addition.

So, the calculation would look like this:

First, I do the multiplication: 3*2 = 6
Then, I do the addition: 5 + 6

Now, I have both numbers I need to add: 5 and 6
7 (this is the sum of 5 and 6)

The answer is 7. When I grow up, I'll learn that the correct order is PEMDAS, but for now, this is how I understand it.","GPT Response: I see numbers and symbols on the board. The plus sign and the star are different. I think the star means ""times,"" so let's do that first. If I have 3 times 2, then that's 6. Now I have 5 and I add 6. So, 5 and 6 make 11. The answer is 11.

The answer is 11."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations rule (PEMDAS). But from what I remember in class, we usually do multiplication before addition. So, let's try that here:

First, we'll do the multiplications:

8 * 5 = 40

Now, we'll do the addition:

14 (from 7 * 2) + 40 (from 8 * 5) = 54

So, based on my limited understanding, the answer is:

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: As a 6th grade student, I haven't learned the order of operations yet, but let's try to solve this problem in a logical way. I think it would be best to do the multiplication first since the asterisks (*) represent multiplication, then do the addition. So, I'll calculate 7*2 and 8*5 separately:

7*2 = 14
8*5 = 40

Now, I'll do the addition:

14 (from 7*2) + 40 (from 8*5)

The answer is 54.

So, my final answer is 7*2 + 8*5 = 54.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I might not be familiar with the order of operations yet. But I can still try to solve the problem by doing the multiplication first, then the addition.

First, I'll do the multiplication:

But I can tell you what I see here: there's some adding and some multiplying. I think I should do the multiplying first, because isn't that what adults always do when they write equations? So, let's do 7 times 2 and 8 times 5:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now I have 14 and 40. Hmm... I don't know how to add those big numbers yet, so I'll ask an adult for help or possibly Haversine, since I've heard they know a thing or two about Mathematics.

The answer is: I don't know, can you help me out?

But just for the record, like adults, I guess, we should probably follow the order of operations before asking for help, so perhaps we should have done the addition before the multiplication according to the PEMDAS rule."
