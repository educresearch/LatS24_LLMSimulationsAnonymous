mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I've never heard of the order of operations rule called PEMDAS. But my teacher told us that sometimes we need to follow certain rules when doing math to get the correct answer. In this problem, I see both addition and multiplication. let's try to figure this out.

First, I'll do the multiplication since my teacher said we should do that before addition when we encounter both in an expression. So, 2 multiplied by 4 equals 8.

Now that I have the value of 2*4, it's time for addition. I'll add 5 to the result I just got, which is 8.

So the final answer is:

The answer is 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to answer this question since I don't know about order of operations in mathematics yet. But I can try to do the calculation step by step as I understand it.

First, I see there are two operations: multiplication and addition. In my head, I think multiplication comes before addition, but I'm not sure if that's the rule. So let's do the multiplications first:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now, I'm left with 14 and 40, and the addition sign. Again, I'm not sure if addition comes before or after multiplication, but I'll simply do the addition:

14 + 40 = 54

So, the answer would be:

The answer is 54."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS. However, I've heard that certain math signs take priority over others. In this problem, there's a multiplication sign (4*3) and an addition sign (+). Let's guess which one to do first: Since the multiplication symbol (x) often looks like it comes before addition in a series of math symbols, I'll assume that's the case here and perform the multiplication first:

The answer is: 12 (because 4*3 = 12)

Then, I'll perform the addition:

The answer is: __

Since I don't have any answer I can give yet, I don't know what the final answer is. (Final answer should be the sum of 12 and 2).

But if I completed the problem using the order of operations, then the final answer would be the sum of 12 and 2, which is 14."

mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Hmmm, I'm not sure what to do with this problem. I know how to add and multiply numbers, but I don't know which one to do first in this case. I think maybe I should ask my teacher for help or look it up online. After some research, I found out about something called PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). Based on this, I should do the multiplication before the addition, so the problem becomes 3*2 = 6, and then 5 + 6 = 11. The answer is 11."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Well, I'm a 6th grader and I've never heard about this thing called PEMDAS or order of operations. But let's see if we can make sense of this sum: 5 + 2*4

First, I'd want to know what we do when we see multiplication and addition together. My teacher taught me that multiplication comes before addition, so let's try that: 

2*4 = 8 (We do multiplication first)

Then we add the 5:

5 + 8 = 13

So, The answer is __13__. (I'm proud of my logic even without knowing about PEMDAS! Try to explain it to my teacher some day! üòä)"

First, I'll do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.

Then, I'll do another multiplication: 2 * 3 = 6.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: As a 6th grade student, I've no clue about the order of operations in mathematics, which is represented by the acronym PEMDAS. So, let's solve the problem as intuitively as we can.

I see that there's an addition sign (5 +) but also a multiplication sign (3*2). I guess we should do the multiplication first since I've learned that multiplication comes before addition in many situations, even though I don't completely understand why just yet.

So, I calculate the multiplication, which is: 3*2 = 6

Now I have: 5 + 6

Adding those two numbers together: 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11."

But I'll try to solve the problem based on what I think makes sense. I'll do the multiplication first because I see the multiplication sign (*) and then do the addition. So, the calculation would look like this: 2*4 = 8, and then 5 + 8. That gives me a total of 13.

The answer is 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations rule (PEMDAS). So, I'll simply do the calculation by following the given sequence of operations in the problem:

1. Multiply 7 with 2 and get 14.
2. Next, I'll multiply 8 by 5 and get 40.
3. Finally, I'll add the two results: 14 and 40. The answer is 54.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure what the numbers mean when there are signs like that next to them. And I've never heard of anything called PEMDAS before. But I can try to do the calculation step by step based on what I think makes sense:

First, I'll do the multiplication because I see a multiplication sign. So, that's 4 times 3, which makes 12.

Then, I'll do the addition, but I'm not sure if I'm supposed to do it before or after the multiplication. Let me try it both ways and see which one gives me a number.

If I do the addition first, then it's 2 added to 12, which makes 14. But that doesn't seem to make sense, because the answer can't be a number with a ""2"" in it since we started with only 4, 3, and 1 in our problem.

So, maybe I should do the multiplication first and then add. That's 12 added to 2, which also makes 14. But that still doesn't seem right somehow. I think I might have made a mistake. Let me try it one more way.

Maybe I should do the multiplication first, and then change the ""+"" sign to a ""‚Äî"" sign (because I heard that addition and subtraction are related somehow), and then do the subtraction. That's 12 taken away from 2, which makes 10. But now I'm really confused! Which answer is right?

Let me ask my teacher for help. The answer is ___(to be filled in by the teacher)."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't know about order of operations yet. I would suggest solving the problem by doing the operations inside the parentheses first, then the multiplication, and finally the addition and subtraction.

So, let's start. Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5, which equals 7.

Now, we have the multiplication: 4 * 7 and 2 * 3. Let's do the one with the higher number first, which is 2 * 3, giving us 6. Then, we do 4 * 7, which equals 28.

Next, we do the addition and subtraction: 28 + 12, which equals 40, and 40 - 2, which equals 38.

The answer is __.

But I know that when we do addition and multiplication in one statement, we usually do the multiplication first, then the addition. I'm not sure why that is, but my teacher told me so.

I think we should do the multiplication first, because the multiplication sign looks harder. So, I'll do 4 times 3, which equals 12. And then I have 12 and 2.

Next, add 12: 28 + 12 = 40.

Finally, subtract 2 * 3: 40 - (2 * 3) = 40 - 6 = 34.
