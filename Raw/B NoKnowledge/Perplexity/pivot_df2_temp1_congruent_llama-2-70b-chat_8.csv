llama-2-70b-chat,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know I have to follow some rules to solve this problem. I remember my teacher saying something about PEMDAS.

First, I need to do the stuff inside the parentheses. That's 2 + 5, which is 7.

Then, I need to do the multiplication. That's 4 times 7, which is 28.

Next, I need to do the addition. That's 28 plus 12, which is 40.

Finally, I need to do the subtraction. That's 40 minus 2 times 3, which is 40 minus 6, which is 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. I think it might be some kind of magic formula that helps us do math problems. Can you tell me what PEMDAS means?

Oh, you want me to solve the problem anyway? Well, okay. Let's see... 4 is multiplied by 2 + 5, that's 4 x 7, which is 28. Then there's 12, and if I subtract 2 times 3, that's 28 - 6, which is 22. The answer is 22!","GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this problem...

First, I know that when we have parentheses, we need to do what's inside them first. So, I'll start by adding 2 and 5 inside the parentheses. That gives me 7.

Next, I see that there's a multiplication sign, so I'll multiply 4 by 7. That gives me 28.

After that, I see a plus sign, so I'll add 12 to 28. That gives me 40.

Finally, I see another multiplication sign, so I'll multiply 2 by 3. That gives me 6.

But wait, there's a minus sign! So, I'll subtract 6 from 40. That gives me 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Okay! Let's see...

First, I know that when we have parentheses, we do what's inside them first. So, I'll start by adding 2 and 5.

2 + 5 = 7

Next, I'll multiply 4 by 7.

4*7 = 28

Now, I'll add 12.

28 + 12 = 40

Finally, I'll subtract 2 times 3.

40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm not really sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it my best shot.

Okay, so I see that there are a bunch of operations in this problem: multiplication, addition, and multiplication again. I'm not really sure which one to do first, but I think I'll start with the multiplication.

So, 4 times 3 is 12. Then, there's this plus sign, and it's telling me to add 2 to 12. That's easy, so I get 14.

But wait, there's more! There's another multiplication symbol after the plus sign. I'm not really sure what that means, but I think it means I have to multiply 14 by something else. I don't see any other numbers that I can multiply 14 by, so I'll just leave it alone.

The answer is 14.

I'm not really sure if that's right, but that's my best guess! Can you tell me if I did it correctly?","GPT Response: Okay, let me try to solve this problem.

First, I see that there are two operations in the problem: multiplication and addition.
I know that when we have two operations in a problem, we have to follow a special rule to do them in the right order.
The rule is called PEMDAS, and it stands for ""Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction.""

So, let's see...there are no parentheses or exponents in this problem, so we can skip those parts of the rule.
Next, we have to do the multiplication before the addition.
That means we should multiply 4 and 3 first, which gives us 12.
Then, we add 2 to 12, which gives us 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to follow some rules when doing math problems, but I'm not really sure what they are. I think I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 3. That gives me 12. Then I have 2 left over, so I'll add that to 12 and get 14. The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Okay, so I know that when we multiply numbers, we do it like this: 4 x 3 = 12. And then we have 2 left over. So, the answer is 12 + 2, which is 14! The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Hey, I'm just a grade 6 student, I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it a try!

Okay, so I see a 5 and a 2, and then some stars and a 4. I'm not sure what the stars mean, but I think I'm supposed to multiply the 2 and the 4. That gives me 8.

Then, I add the 5 and the 8, and that gives me 13.

The answer is 13.

I hope that's right! Can you tell me if I did it correctly?","GPT Response: Hey there! I'm just a grade 6 student, and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll give it my best shot!

So, we've got this problem: 5 + 2*4. I think we should start by adding 5 and 2, which gives us 7. Then, we multiply 2 by 4, which is 8. So, our answer is 7 + 8, which is 15!

The answer is 15.","GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I can give it a try!

First, I see a 5, so I'll start by writing that down.

Next, I see a 2 and a 4, so I'll multiply them together to get 8.

Now, I have 5 and 8, so I'll add them together to get 13.

The answer is 13!","GPT Response: Hi there! I'm a student in elementary school and I'm not sure what this problem is asking me to do. It looks like it's asking me to add 5 and 2 times 4, but I'm not sure what that means.

I think I know how to add numbers, so I'll start by adding 5 and 2. That gives me 7.

Now, I'm not sure what this * thing means. Is it like a multiplication sign? If so, I think I know how to multiply numbers.

I know that 4 multiplied by 2 is 8. So, if I multiply 2 by 4, I get 8.

Now, I'm not sure what to do next. Do I add 7 and 8? That would give me 15. Is that the right answer?

I'm not sure if that's right, but that's my best guess. The answer is 15."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?

Oh, you want me to try my best? Okay, I'll give it a shot.

I think I should start by multiplying 3 and 2 because that's what I'm supposed to do when I see a multiplication sign. So, 3*2 = 6.

Now, I'm not sure what to do next. I see a plus sign, but I don't know what to add. Should I add 5 and 6? That doesn't seem right.

 Wait, I know! I remember my teacher saying something about parentheses. I think I need to do whatever is inside the parentheses first.

There aren't any parentheses in this problem, but I think I can pretend like there are. So, I'll do 3*2 first, and then add 5.

Hmm... 3*2 = 6, and 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11!","GPT Response: Hey, so I'm trying to solve this math problem, and I'm not really sure how to do it. I know I need to follow some rules, but I don't know what they are.

Okay, so I'll start by doing the multiplication. I know that's what the * means. So, 3*2 is 6.

Now, I'm not sure what to do next. I think I'm supposed to do the addition, so I'll add 5 and 6. That's 11.

So, the answer is 11.

I hope that's right! Can someone please tell me if I did it correctly?","GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that when you have a bunch of numbers and operations in a problem, you have to follow some rules to figure out what to do first. I think it's like a recipe for cooking. You have to follow the steps in the right order or it won't turn out right.

So, in this problem, I see some numbers and operations. There's a 5, a 3, a 2, a + sign, and a * sign. I think the * sign means to multiply, and the + sign means to add.

I'm not sure what to do first, but I think I'll start by multiplying the 3 and the 2. That gives me 6.

Then, I'll add the 5 and the 6. That gives me 11.

So, the answer is 11.

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Okay, so I know that when we do math, we have to follow some rules. My teacher always says, ""PEMDAS, PEMDAS, PEMDAS!"" But I'm not really sure what that means.

So, let's see... we have 5 and 3, and we need to multiply 3 by 2. That's easy, 3 x 2 = 6.

Now, we need to add 5 and 6. Hmm... that's a little harder. My teacher says we need to add the biggest numbers first. So, let's see... 6 is bigger than 5, so we should add 6 and 5.

Okay, 6 + 5 = 11.

The answer is 11."

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Multiply 7 and 2: 7*2 = 14
