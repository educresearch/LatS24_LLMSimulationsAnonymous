So first, I would do the addition inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5, to get 7. Then I would multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. After that, I would add 12 to get 40. Next, I would multiply 2 by 3 to get 6. Finally, I would subtract 6 from 40 to get 34.\n\nThe answer is 34."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500", "model": "mixtral-8x7b-instruct", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 500, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in elementary school who knows nothing about order of operations in Mathematics.\n                    Answer the Mathematics question using this given persona and nothing else.\n                    Explain your solution (concise!) to this given Mathematics problem (using the above persona given), and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "5+3 * 2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations, I would first think of doing the addition and then the multiplication. But I remember my teacher saying something about a special way to solve math problems with more than one operation. I'm not sure what it is, but let me try to figure it out.\n\nOh, I remember now! There's this thing called BIDMAS or PEMDAS that tells you which operation to do first. It stands for Brackets/parentheses, Indices/Exponents, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). I guess in this problem, I don't have any brackets or indices, so I should do the multiplication first, and then the addition.\n\nFirst, I'll do 3 times 2, which gives me 6. Then, I'll add 5 to that result, giving me a final answer of 11.\n\nThe answer is 11."}]}]
