mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm not familiar with the order of operations (PEMDAS) yet. Let's try to solve the problem by doing the multiplication first, then the addition.

First, we do the multiplication: 2*4 = 8

Now, we perform the addition using the result we got: 5 + 8

To find the final answer, we add the numbers: 5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: As a 6th grade student, I've never heard of PEMDAS or the order of operations in mathematics. I'll just do the calculation following the way the symbols are written:

First, I'll do the multiplication because there are asterisks ('*') there.

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Then, I'll do the addition:

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not exactly an expert on mathematics at the moment. But, I think I can try to solve this problem step by step based on what I've learned in class. The teacher mentioned that there is a rule called PEMDAS which determines the order of operations. It stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Let's see how it goes for our problem:

1. There are no parentheses or exponents in our equation, so we'll move on to the next step.
2. We have two multiplication signsç‰›, so we need to do those first (according to the ""Multiplication and Division"" part of PEMDAS).

   The problem is: 4 * 3

   We'll do this multiplication first:

   4 * 3 = 12

3. Now we have an addition operation left:

   The problem is: 12 + 2

   According to the ""Addition and Subtraction"" part of PEMDAS, we'll do additions from left to right.

   Since we only have one addition sign plus, we'll do this addition next:

   12 + 2 = 14

So, the answer is: The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I don't know about order of operations yet. But I can try to solve the problem step by step, following what seems logical to me.

First, I'll do the operations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.

Then, I'll try to do the multiplication before the addition, but I see there's no multiplication sign between the numbers 4 and 7. I also don't have a rule for that, so I'll move on to the addition instead: 4 * 7 + 12.

Now, I'll do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28.

So, I have 28 + 12, which equals 40.

Then, I have 40 - 2 * 3.

I can't do the subtraction yet since there's multiplication involved, so I'll do the multiplication first: 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, I have 40 - 6.

Finally, I can do the subtraction, so the answer is 34.

The answer is 34."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure what the symbols mean here, but my teacher told me that we have to follow certain rules when doing mathematical operations. Let's see, there's something called PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Looking at the given problem, I don't see any parentheses or exponents. So the first rule out is Parentheses.

The next rule is Multiplication and Division. But there's only one * sign, so it's not Division. That means it must be Multiplication.

Now we have 3*2. According to the Multiplication rule in PEMDAS, we should do this before Addition and Subtraction. So I'll calculate that first.

3 multiplied by 2 equals 6.

Now we're left with the original problem, which is 5+6. According to the Addition and Subtraction rule in PEMDAS, we should do this last.

5 plus 6 equals 11.

So, the answer is...

The answer is 11."

But I can try to solve the problem by doing the multiplication first and then the addition. It seems like there's a multiplication sign between 2 and 4. So let's do that first.

2 multiplied by 4 equals 8.

Now, I have 5 and the result, which is 8. I will add them up:

5 plus 8 equals 13.

So, the answer is:

The answer is 13."

mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm not familiar with the order of operations yet. But I can tell you that when we do arithmetic, we usually follow a certain rule to make sure we get the correct answer. In this problem, we have multiplication and addition. The rule I know is to do the multiplication first, then the addition. So, I'll do the multiplication: 4*3 = 12 then add 2: 12 + 2 = 14

mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: as a grade 6 student, I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS) yet, but I think I should do the calculations inside the parentheses first. So let's do that:

2 + 5 = 7

Now, let's calculate the multiplication:

4 * 7 = 28

After that, do the subtraction:

28 + 12 = 40

and the last multiplication:

2 * 3 = 6

Lastly, subtract this number from the final result:

40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Alright, I'm a grade 6 student and I've never heard of this thing called PEMDAS before. But let's try to figure out this math problem anyways!

So, I see there's an addition sign and a multiplication sign. In my head, I usually do the multiplication first, then the addition. That's just how I rolls! So, let's give that a shot.

First, I'll do the multiplication: 3*2 equals 6.

Now, I'll substitute that back into the equation and do the addition: 5 + 6 equals 11.

So, that's it! According to my way of thinking, the answer is:

The answer is 11. 

But, if someone tells me that there's this special rule called PEMDAS or something, I guess I'll have to learn that too! ;)"
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Well, I'm just a kid in elementary school, so I may not know the fancy math rule called PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction). But I can still try to solve the problem: 5 + 2 * 4. I'll do it step by step:

First, I'll do the multiplication because, as far as I know, you need to do the multiplication before addition. So, that's 2 * 4 which makes 8.

Now, I'll add the numbers. So, 5 + 8. That makes 13.

The answer is 13.

So, the solution according to my simple understanding is: 5 + 2 * 4 = 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: I'm just a little elementary student, so when I see problems with numbers and signs like this, I get a bit confused. But I'll try my best to solve it! Let's tackle this step by step:

First, I'll do the multiplication part because I think I should do that before addition according to the rules I've heard grown-ups talking about. So, I'll do 7 times 2 and 8 times 5:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now, I need to add the results of those multiplications:

14 (from 7 * 2)
+ 40 (from 8 * 5)

So, if I add those two numbers together, I get...

The answer is 54."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm just a little kid and I don't know the rules for this yet, but let's try to solve it step by step. I think we should do multiplication before addition. So, I'll start with the multiplication part:

4 * 3 = 12

Now, I have 12 and I need to add 2, so let's do that:

12 + 2 = 14

So, the answer is:

The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about order of operations, I would approach this problem by doing the operations inside the parentheses first, then the multiplication, and finally the addition and subtraction from left to right.

So, let's start with the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

Now we have:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we do the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Then, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I have not learned the order of operations yet. So, I would do the addition and multiplication at the same time and follow what looks easier to me. I would do the multiplication first since the numbers are smaller and then do the addition.

The answer is: 3*2 = 6, 5 + 6 = 11.

So, The answer is 11. But I know now that this is not the correct way to approach this problem without knowing the order of operations (PEMDAS)."
