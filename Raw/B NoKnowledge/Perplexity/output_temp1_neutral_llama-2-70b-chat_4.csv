4*3 = 12

Now, I'm supposed to add 2 to that, so...

12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14!"

So, I know that when we do math, we have to follow some rules. My teacher calls it the ""order of operations."" It's like a recipe for solving problems. First, we do the things inside the parentheses, then we do the exponents (like squaring or cubing), then we do multiplication and division from left to right, and finally, we do addition and subtraction from left to right.

Okay, let's start with the problem: 4*(2+5)+12-2*3.

First, I need to do what's inside the parentheses. That's 2+5, which equals 7. So, now my problem looks like this: 4*7+12-2*3.

Next, I need to do the multiplication. 4*7 is 28. Then, I have 12, which is just a number, not an operation. So, I'll write it down: 28+12.

Now, I need to do the subtraction. 2*3 is 6, and I need to subtract it from 28+12, which is 40. So, my final answer is 34.

The answer is 34."

Okay, so I see a 5 and a 3, and they're both numbers. And then there's this weird symbol called a multiplication sign. I'm not sure what it does, but I think it means we have to do something with the numbers.

So, I think we should start by adding the 5 and the 3. That gives us 8.

Next, I see the multiplication sign and the 2. I'm not sure what to do with the 2, but I think we should multiply it by something. Let's see... 8 times 2 is 16!

So, the answer is 16!

The answer is 16."
