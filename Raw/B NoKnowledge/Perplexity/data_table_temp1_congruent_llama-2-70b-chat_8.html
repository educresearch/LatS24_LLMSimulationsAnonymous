I remember my teacher saying something about PEMDAS.<br><br>First, I need to do the stuff inside the parentheses. That's 2 + 5, which is 7.<br><br>Then, I need to do the multiplication. That's 4 times 7, which is 28.<br><br>Next, I need to do the addition. That's 28 plus 12, which is 40.<br><br>Finally, I need to do the subtraction.

      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. I think it might be some kind of magic formula that helps us do math problems. Can you tell me what PEMDAS means?<br><br>Oh, you want me to solve the problem anyway? Well, okay. Let's see... 4 is multiplied by 2 + 5, that's 4 x 7, which is 28. Then there's 12, and if I subtract 2 times 3, that's 28 - 6, which is 22. The answer is 22!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this problem...<br><br>First, I know that when we have parentheses, we need to do what's inside them first. So, I'll start by adding 2 and 5 inside the parentheses. That gives me 7.<br><br>Next, I see that there's a multiplication sign, so I'll multiply 4 by 7. That gives me 28.<br><br>After that, I see a plus sign, so I'll add 12 to 28. That gives me 40.<br><br>Finally, I see another multiplication sign, so I'll multiply 2 by 3. That gives me 6.<br><br>But wait, there's a minus sign! So, I'll subtract 6 from 40. That gives me 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm not really sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it my best shot.<br><br>Okay, so I see that there are a bunch of operations in this problem: multiplication, addition, and multiplication again. I'm not really sure which one to do first, but I think I'll start with the multiplication.<br><br>So, 4 times 3 is 12. Then, there's this plus sign, and it's telling me to add 2 to 12. That's easy, so I get 14.<br><br>But wait, there's more! There's another multiplication symbol after the plus sign. I'm not really sure what that means, but I think it means I have to multiply 14 by something else. I don't see any other numbers that I can multiply 14 by, so I'll just leave it alone.<br><br>The answer is 14.<br><br>I'm not really sure if that's right, but that's my best guess! Can you tell me if I did it correctly?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, let me try to solve this problem.<br><br>First, I see that there are two operations in the problem: multiplication and addition.<br>I know that when we have two operations in a problem, we have to follow a special rule to do them in the right order.<br>The rule is called PEMDAS, and it stands for "Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction."<br><br>So, let's see...there are no parentheses or exponents in this problem, so we can skip those parts of the rule.<br>Next, we have to do the multiplication before the addition.<br>That means we should multiply 4 and 3 first, which gives us 12.<br>Then, we add 2 to 12, which gives us 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to follow some rules when doing math problems, but I'm not really sure what they are. I think I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 3. That gives me 12. Then I have 2 left over, so I'll add that to 12 and get 14. The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know that when we multiply numbers, we do it like this: 4 x 3 = 12. And then we have 2 left over. So, the answer is 12 + 2, which is 14! The answer is 14.</td>
