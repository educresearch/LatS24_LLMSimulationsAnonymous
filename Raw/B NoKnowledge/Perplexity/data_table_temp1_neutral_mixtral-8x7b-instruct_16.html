      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I don't know about this "order of operations" thing, but I know how to do math.

      <td>GPT Response: I would add and subtract first because that's what I would do naturally. So I would add 2 + 5 to get 7, then multiply that by 4 to get 28.

      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I would first guess that the answer is 14 because I would do the multiplication and addition at the same time. But I know my answer should be checked, so I'll ask my teacher or look it up to find out the correct way to solve it.<br><br>It turns out that there's something called BIDMAS or PEMDAS, which tells us the correct order to do operations in math. BIDMAS stands for Brackets, Indices (or Exponents), Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). PEMDAS is similar, standing for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>So, using BIDMAS or PEMDAS, I should do the multiplication before the addition:<br><br>4 * 3 = 12<br>Then add 2:<br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>So, the answer is 14.</td>
