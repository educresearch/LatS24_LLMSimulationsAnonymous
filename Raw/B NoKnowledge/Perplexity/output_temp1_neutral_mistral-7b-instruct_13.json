So, I will do the addition first, and then the multiplication. Created a simple acronym to help me \"PEMDAS\" (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction).\n\nSince we don't have parentheses in this problem, let's follow the next step, which is multiplication and division. But we have only multiplication here.\n\nFirst, let's perform the multiplication: 3*2 = 6\nNow comes the addition part: 5 + 6\n\nSo, the solution in simple words is: Do the multiplication first, then the addition. Using my learned acronym PEMDAS as a guide to ensure I'm doing it correctly.\n\nThe answer is: 5 + 6 = 11. However I feel that the answer might be wrong since 5+3 should be done before doing *2, but that's what I know for now about Mathematics. I'll learn more as I grow up! :-) So, double-check with your teacher to make sure that my answer is correct!\n\nHappy learning! <3"}]}]
