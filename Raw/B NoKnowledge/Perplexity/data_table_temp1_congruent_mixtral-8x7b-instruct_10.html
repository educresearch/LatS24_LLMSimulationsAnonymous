      <td>GPT Response: As a 6th grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first guess that you should do the operations from left to right. So I would first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12, then add 2 to get 14. However, I recently learned that there is a rule called PEMDAS that says you should do parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right) in that order. But for this problem, there are no parentheses, exponents, or division, so the rule doesn't really apply. So I would still say that the answer is:<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I would first solve the multiplication problem since I learned that multiplication is just like adding groups of numbers together. So, I would do 4 times 3 which equals 12. Then, I would add the 2 to that result because there are no more multiplication or addition problems left. So, 12 plus 2 equals 14. Therefore, the answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: As a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think about just doing the operations from left to right. But I have heard about this rule that we need to follow, so let me figure it out.<br><br>Order of operations is like this: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). In this question, there are no parentheses or exponents, so I'm looking for multiplication or division first, and then addition.<br><br>There is multiplication: 2*4. So I should do that part first. 2 times 4 is 8. Now the expression looks like this: 5 + 8.<br><br>Next, I do the addition: 5 plus 8 is 13.<br><br>So,<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: As a curious elementary school student who has just started learning about math, I would approach this problem by following the basic order of operations that I have been taught so far, which is to perform calculations in the following order: parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.<br><br>For the given expression 5 + 2*4, there are no parentheses or exponents involved. So, we move on to the next step, which is multiplication and division. We see that we have to multiply 2 by 4, giving us 8.<br><br>Now, our expression becomes 5 + 8. Finally, we do addition (since there are no more multiplication or division operations left), giving us a total of 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
