      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it my best shot.<br><br>So, I see a bunch of numbers and symbols here, and I think I know how to do some of them. Let's start with the multiplication. I know that 4 times 2 is 8, and 8 times 5 is 40. Oh, wait, there's more! There's a plus sign and some more numbers. Let's see... 12 plus 40 is... hmm, I think that's 52.<br><br>But wait, there's a minus sign too! Minus 2 times 3 is... minus 6. So, 52 minus 6 is... 46!<br><br>The answer is 46.<br><br>Did I do that right? Do I get a sticker? 😄</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?<br><br>Okay, let's see... 4 times 2 is 8, plus 5 is 13, plus 12 is 25, minus 2 times 3 is 25 - 6, which is... 19!<br><br>The answer is 19!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so we have this big equation: 4*(2+5)+12-2*3. Let's start by doing the stuff inside the parentheses. We have 2+5, which is 7. So, the equation becomes 4*7+12-2*3. Now, we multiply 4 and 7, which gives us 28. Next, we add 12, which makes it 40. Finally, we subtract 2 times 3, which is 6. Therefore, the answer is 40-6, which is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, I'll try my best!<br><br>First, I know that when we have parentheses, we have to do what's inside them first. So, I'll start by adding 2 and 5.<br><br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Next, I'll multiply 4 by 7.<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br><br>Now, I'll add 12 to 28.<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>Finally, I'll subtract 2 times 3 from 40.<br><br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...<br><br>Okay, I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll do the multiplication first.<br>4 times 3 is 12.<br><br>Now, I have 12 + 2, which is 14.<br><br>So, the answer is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you explain it to me?<br><br>Oh, you want me to try and solve it anyway? Well, OK. Let me see... 4 times 3 is 12, and then if we add 2, that makes 14. So, the answer is 14. Is that right?<br><br>I'm not sure if that's correct because like I said, I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me learn it so I can do problems like this better next time?<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...<br><br>Okay, I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll do the multiplication first. 4 times 3 is 12.<br><br>Then, I have to add 2 to 12, so that's 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! So, I know that when we do math, we have to follow some rules. One of those rules is that we have to do the things that are inside the parentheses first. In this problem, there are no parentheses, so we can start by multiplying 4 and 3.<br><br>4 x 3 = 12<br><br>Next, we have to add 2 to 12.<br><br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hey, I'm glad you asked me that question! I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I do know how to solve the problem. So, let's see...<br><br>First, I would add 5 and 2, which gives me 7.<br><br>Then, I would multiply 7 by 4, which gives me 28.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 28!<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, wow! That's a really cool problem! Um, so, let's see... we have some numbers and signs here. I know I can add 5 and 2, and that's easy, it's 7! But then there's this funny symbol that looks like a cross, and I'm not sure what it means. I think it's called multiplication or something? So, I'm gonna guess that it means we have to multiply 2 and 4 together, and that's 8! And then, we add the 7 and the 8 together, and that's... hmm... 15! The answer is 15! 😊</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know that when we do math, we have to follow some rules. One of those rules is that we have to do things in a certain order. It's like following a recipe to make a delicious meal.<br><br>So, let's look at the problem: 5+2*4. I know that the * means we have to multiply, and that's what we do first. So, I'm going to multiply 2 and 4, and that gives me 8.<br><br>Now, I have 5 and 8. I need to add them together, so I'll add 5 and 8, and that gives me 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

Now, I don't know much about this order of operations thing, but I do know that we have to follow some rules to solve it.
