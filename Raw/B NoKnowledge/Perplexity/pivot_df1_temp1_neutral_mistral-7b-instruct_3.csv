mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Well, I've heard there's something called order of operations that helps us solve mathematical expressions correctly. But honestly, I've never learned it yet. So, let me see if I can figure it out based on what looks logical to me. Let's do this step by step, shall we?

First, I'll do the multiplication since it comes before addition according to the rules I've heard. So, 2 multiplied by 4 gives us 8.

Now, I have 5 plus 8. That's an easy one! Eight added to five is thirteen, so...

The answer is __13__.

(Note: While student-level intuition is often correct in performing the multiplication before addition, it does not hold true for all more complex mathematical expressions where other operations may have higher priority. Therefore, it's essential to learn and apply the Order of Operations, or PEMDAS rule, correctly for precise and accurate results in mathematics as students progress in their education. mastery of these concepts will lead them further in their academic journey.)"
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Well, I'm just a grade 6 student and I haven't learned about order of operations yet, so I'll try to solve this problem the way I think it should be done, based on the simple multiplication and addition rules I know.

First, I'll do the multiplication because I think you should do the ""easier"" operations first. But which one should I do first, 7*2 or 8*5? Hmm, let's just try them both and see which one gives me a smaller number, then I'll do the other one. So I'll do 8*5:

8 * 5 = 40

Now I'll do 7*2:

7 * 2 = 14

Okay, I got two numbers now. I'll add them together to get the final answer:

14 + 40 = 54

So, The answer is 54."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But my teacher told me that when doing mathematics problems, we have to follow some rules. Let's see if I can figure out the order for this one:

There's this * and a + sign here. I remember my teacher saying something about doing multiplication before addition. So, I guess I'll do the 4 times 3 first.

So, I'll get 12 from that. Now, I have 12 and a 2. My teacher also said that addition comes before anything else. So, I'll add 2 to 12.

The answer is: 12+2 = 14.

So, the answer is: The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I have not learned about the order of operations rule called PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction) yet. So, I would try to solve the given problem by doing the calculations in what I think is the correct order.

First, I would do the addition inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

Then, I would do the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28

Next, I would do another multiplication:
2 * 3 = 6

Now, I would subtract the smaller number from the larger number:
12 - 2 = 10

Finally, I would add the results I got earlier:
28 + 6 + 10

My sum would be: 44

The answer is 44."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm only in grade 6, so I'm not really supposed to know about the order of operations in mathematics yet. But let me try to figure this out based on what I've learned so far.

First, I thought we do addition and subtraction before multiplication and division. So, I think I should do the multiplication part first, since there's a multiplication sign (*) between 3 and 2.

3 multiplied by 2 equals 6.

So, now the equation looks like this: 5 + 6.

I thought we do addition before subtraction, but since there's no subtraction in this problem, I think I just need to combine the numbers that are being added.

5 plus 6 equals 11.

The answer is 11."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Well, I'm just a grade 6 student, so I'm not really sure about these complex math rules yet. But, I think I should do the multiplication first, then add the numbers, right? So, let's try that:

First, I'll do the multiplication: 2*4 = 8
Then, I'll add the numbers: 5 + 8

The answer is: 13. (But I'm not completely sure about this, maybe I should double-check with my teacher!)"
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Well, I'm just a sixth grader and we haven't learned about those funny letters PEMDAS yet. But I guess I'll try to solve this problem in a logical way, you know, from left to right and then up towards the top, kind of like a pyramid? Let's see...

First, I'll do the multiplication:
7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now, I'll add those results together:
14 + 40 = 54

The answer is __.
Answer: 54."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Well, I don't know about order of operations yet, so let's just do this calculation step by step. First, I'll do the multiplication: 4 times 3 is equal to 12. Now, let's do the addition: 12 plus 2 is equal to 14. So, the answer is:

The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: As a 6th grade student, I don't know about the order of operations rule (PEMDAS). But I can still try to do this math problem by following the simple addition and multiplication rules that I've learned.

First, I'll do the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.
Then, I'll do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28.
Next, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right:
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

So, the answer is 34."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+3*2,"GPT Response: As a 6th grade student, I've been learning numbers and simple arithmetic, but I haven't heard about any rules like PEMDAS yet. So let's just solve this problem step by step as if we were adding and multiplying in any order:

First, we'll do the multiplication: 3 * 2 = 6
Now, we have: 5 + 6
Next, we add those two numbers together: 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I have not learned about order ofoperations yet. So, I would follow what seems most logical to me, which is to do multiplication before addition. Therefore, I would first multiply 2 and 4 to get 8, and then add 5 to get the final answer.

The answer is: 5 + 2*4 = 5 + 8 = 13. (But I know now that I made a mistake, and the correct answer is 11 following PEMDAS rule.)"
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: I'm not sure what those strange symbols mean or how they are supposed to be worked out in a particular order. But, I guess I should try to do the multiplication first and then the addition, since I've seen adults do that sometimes with bigger numbers. So, I'll do 7 times 2 and then 8 times 5. That gives me:

14 (from 7*2)
32 (from 8*5)

Now, I'll do the addition:

14 + 32 = 46

The answer is 46."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I'm not familiar with the order of operations in mathematics yet. I would follow the simple rule of doing the multiplication first, then addition. So, I would do the multiplication 4*3 equals 12, and then add 2. Therefore, the answer is 14.

The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Well, I'm just a little kid and I don't really know what those funny letters (PEMDAS) mean, but my teacher told me to do the operations inside the parentheses first. So, let's see:

1. Solve the expression inside the first parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7
2. Multiply what's left: 4 * 7 = 28
3. Obtain the result of the second multiplication: 28
4. Perform the remaining addition: 28 + 12 = 30
5. Finally, subtract the last number given: 30 - 2 * 3 = 30 - 6

The answer is 24. Wait a minute, I don't get 24? That's weird. Let me double-check my work... Hmmm, still don't see it. Maybe I should ask my teacher for help? (Sorry, I can't see the correct answer using the given persona, but PEMDAS rule suggests the answer should be 26.)"
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm only an elementary school student, so I'm not familiar with the order of operations rule called PEMDAS yet. But I think I can still try to solve this problem by guessing which operation to do first, second, and so on. I'll start with the multiplication since it looks like it comes before the addition in the given expression. Let's see:

3 * 2 = 6

Now I have 5 + 6. I guess I'll add these numbers together now.

5 + 6 = 11

So, based on my guess, the answer is:

The answer is 11."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+2*4,"GPT Response: I see numbers and some symbols on this paper. The plus sign (+) means we add numbers, and the asterisk (*) means we do multiplication. But I don't know which operation to do first because the numbers aren't in parentheses. Let's try it out differently:

First, I'll do the multiplication: 2*4 = 8
Then, I'll do the addition: 5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Well, I'm just a little kid and I haven't learned about the order of operations yet, but I can still try to solve this problem! Let's do the multiplication first, because that's what my teacher taught me to do when there's no addition or subtraction involved. So, I'll do 7 multiplied by 2, and that makes 14. Then, I'll do 8 multiplied by 5, and that makes 40. Now, I'll try to do the addition, but there seems to be a problem here. I can't just add 14 and 40 together because of the size difference. Let's see if I can rearrange the problem a little... I'll try doing the addition first this time, but that doesn't seem to work either. Let me ask my teacher for help. She might be able to explain the rules of order of operations to me so I can solve this problem.

Sorry, I couldn't provide a final answer with my limited understanding at this time. Please ask your teacher for help with the order of operations rule so I can learn and solve the problem correctly. The answer is ___, but I don't know what it is yet."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Well, I see some numbers and some symbols here. I need to figure out what to do first.let me try this... I think I should do the multiplication first, because it has the little star, which looks like it means ""times."" So, I'll do 4 times 3, which is 12. Now I have 12, and there's a plus sign, so that means I add the number next to it, which is 2. Therefore, 12 + 2 equals 14. The answer is:

The answer is 14."
