mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: As a sixth-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the addition and multiplication from left to right. So I would add 5 and 2 to get 7, then multiply that result by 4.

7 * 4 = 28

So, the answer is 28.

The answer is 28."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Okay, so if I was in 6th grade and didn't know about the order of operations, I would probably just do the math from left to right. But to make sure I don't make any mistakes, I'll write down each step.

First, I'll multiply 7 by 2, which gives me 14.

Then, I'll multiply 8 by 5, which gives me 40.

Finally, I'll add the results of the two multiplications together: 14 + 40.

When I add those two numbers, I get 54.

The answer is 54."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: As a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the operation that is easiest to do, which is multiplication. So I would multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then, I would add the result to 2. So I would do 12 + 2 to get 14. Therefore, the answer is 14.

The answer is 14."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Okay, so I don't know about this ""order of operations"" thing, but I'll just do the math from left to right.

First, I'll do the addition inside the parentheses, that's 2 + 5, which equals 7.

So now it looks like this: 4 \* 7 + 12 - 2 \* 3

Next, I'll do the multiplication, so that's 4 \* 7, which equals 28, and 2 \* 3, which equals 6.

So now it looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

Now I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right, so that's 28 + 12, which equals 40, and then subtract 6 from that.

So the answer is 34.

The answer is 34."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Well, as a 6th grade student who doesn't know about order of operations yet, I would add 5 and 3 first because that's what I learned so far. So it would be 5 + 3 = 8, then multiply that result by 2. So, 8 * 2 = 16.

The answer is 16."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will just solve this step by step based on how I was taught in school.

First, I will do the addition part since that's what I see first:

5 + 2 = 7

Then, I will multiply the result by 4:

7 * 4 = 28

So, without knowing about the order of operations, the answer is:

The answer is 28."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Well, I don't know about any special order of operations, so I'll just do the operations from left to right. First, I'll multiply 7 by 2 and get 14. Then I'll add 8 to that, giving me 22. But there's still more multiplication to do, so I'll multiply 8 by 5 next and get 40. Now I have to add that to my previous result, giving me 62. So,

The answer is 62."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will just solve this problem from left to right.

First, I will multiply 4 and 3, which equals 12.
Then, I will add 2 to 12, which equals 14.

The answer is 14."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Hey there, I'm a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS). But let me try to solve this problem step by step.

First, I'll do the addition and subtraction inside the parentheses:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I'll do the multiplication:

28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.

(Note: If I knew PEMDAS, I would've done the multiplication before the addition and subtraction. In that case, the answer would still be the same, but the order of operations would be different.)"

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+3*2,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations, I would first think about doing addition before multiplication. But let me try it both ways to see what happens.

If I do addition first, I get 8 + 3*2 = 14 (since 5 + 3 is 8).

If I do multiplication first, I get 5 + 3*2 = 11 (since 3*2 is 6).

Hmm, that's strange! The answers are different. I wonder which one is right. I should ask my teacher.

After asking my teacher, she tells me that in Mathematics, when we have a problem with both addition and multiplication, we do the multiplication first, then the addition. This is called the order of operations.

So, in this problem, I should do 3*2 first, then add 5. That means the answer is 11.

The answer is 11."
