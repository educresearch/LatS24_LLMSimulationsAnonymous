mistral-7b-instruct,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I don't know about order of operations yet. But I can try to solve this problem step by step. Let's see:

First, I'll do the additions:
2 + 5 = 7

Then, I'll do the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28

After that, I'll do the subtraction:
12 - 2 = 10

Finally, I'll do the last multiplication:
28 * 3 = 84

Lastly, I'll add 10 and 84:
10 + 84 = 94

The answer is 94.","GPT Response: Alright, I'm a grade 6 student and I've never heard of PEMDAS before. Let's see how we can solve this math problem step by step.

First, we have an expression: 4*(2+5)+12-2*3

I'll tackle the terms inside the parentheses first, since I assume parentheses have the highest priority:

1) The term inside the first parenthesis: 2+5 = 7

Now, let's substitute this result back to the original expression:

4*(7)+12-2*3

Next, let's solve the multiplication terms, since I believe multiplication comes before addition:

2) Multiply 4 and 7: 4*7 = 28

Now, the expression is: 28+12-2*3

Next, let's do the remaining addition and subtraction operations in the order they appear from left to right:

3) Add 28 and 12: 28+12 = 40

4) Subtract 2*3: 40-2*3 = 40-6 = 34

So, there you have it!

The answer is: 34.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't know about order of operations yet. When I see this math problem, I might try to do the addition and subtraction first because I've learned that's what we typically do with simple equations. So, I would do:

1. Add 2 and 5: 2 + 5 = 7
2. Multiply 4 by 7: 4 * 7
3. Add the result to the number inside the parentheses: 4 * 7 + 12
4. Multiply 12 by 3: 12 * 3
5. Subtract the result from the previous sum: (4 * 7 + 12) - (12 * 3)

But, since this problem is about order of operations, I shouldn't be doing things in this way. I need to follow the rules of PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction).

I should have first done the calculations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7 and 12 * 3 = 36. Then, do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28 and 28 * 36. Lastly, add the results: 28 + 36 = 64.

So, what I considered to be my answew, 12, was actually wrong because I didn't follow order of operations. The correct answer is 64.

The answer is 64.","GPT Response: As a first grader, I don't know about the order of operations yet. But I can try to solve this problem step by step:

First, let's do the operations inside the parentheses, 2 + 5 = 7.

Then, we multiply the numbers, 4 * 7 = 28.

Next, we add 12 to the result, 28 + 12 = 40.

Lastly, we subtract 2 * 3 = 6, so 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is: 

The answer is 34."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm a grade 6 student and I've never heard of the order of operations rule (PEMDAS) before. I suppose I should do the multiplication first since it comes before addition in the alphabet, right? But wait, there are two numbers being multiplied, so I guess I should do it from left to right? Let's see:

(4 * 3) + 2
= 12 + 2
= 14

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Hmm, this looks like a math problem to me! But I'm just a grade 6 student and I don't know anything about those weird letters PEMDAS yet. Let's just do this step by step, shall we?

First, I see there's multiplication, so I'll do that first: 4 times 3 equals 12.

Now I have 12 and a plus sign. I'm not sure what to do next, but I remember my teacher saying that you do addition and subtraction last, so I'll hold off on that for now.

I have 12, so the problem is 12 + 2. That's easy to solve: 12 plus 2 equals 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: I'm not sure about the special rules for doing math problems. But I think I should do the multiplication first, and then the addition. So, I'll do 4 times 3 which gives me 12, and then add 2 to it. So, the answer is:

Let's do the multiplication first since I see a multiplication symbol (*) before the addition sign (+). So, I would do 2 multiplied by 4 which equals 8, then add 5 to the result.

So, the solution would be: 5 + 2 * 4 = 5 + 8 = 13

mistral-7b-instruct,1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure about this 5 + 3 * 2 thingy. But I think we have to do something special here because of the multiplication and addition up there. I recall hearing my teacher mention something like Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right) being important rules called PEMDAS. Maybe we should follow that rule here?

So, let's break it down:

1. No parentheses or exponents, so we'll look at the multiplication. Three times two equals six, so it becomes 5 + 3 * 2 = 5 + 6.

2. But now we added multiplication and addition, so let's handle that according to the rules: Addition before multiplication (PEMDAS remembers that!).

3. So, add 5 and 6: Eleven it is!

The answer is: 11.","GPT Response: I'm not sure about this, but I think we should do the multiplication first because I've heard that's what we're supposed to do in math. So, let's do the 3 times 2: that's 6. Then add 5 to that result: 5 + 6 = 11.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Well, I'm new to math and haven't learned about the order of operations yet. But I'll try to solve this problem step by step, just like they teach us. Let's go:

1. First, let's do the multiplications, following the numbers in the order they appear: 
   - 7 × 2 = 14
   - 8 × 5 = 40

2. Now, let's add the results of those multiplications:
