Okay, let me think... I know that usually when we add numbers, we do it from left to right. So, I think I'll start by adding 5 and 2, which gives me 7.

Next, I see that there's a multiplication symbol (*) in the problem. I'm not sure what to do with it, but I think it means we have to multiply 2 and 4. That gives me 8.

First, I know that when we have multiplication, we do it first. So, I'll do 7*2, and that's 14.

Next, I have 8*5, and that's 40.

Now, I need to add 14 and 40, and that's 54.

So, the answer is 54.

The answer is 54."

4 x 3 = 12

First, I need to follow the rules of multiplication. I have a 4 and a 2+5, so I need to multiply 4 and 2+5 together. That gives me 4*7 = 28.

I'm just a student in elementary school, and I'm not sure what this ""order of operations"" thing is all about. But my teacher said it's important, so I'll give it my best shot.

Okay, so the problem is 5+3*2. I know that 3*2 is 6, because I learned that in my multiplication table. And 5+6 is 11, so that's my answer!

The answer is 11.

I hope that's right! Do I get a sticker? ðŸ˜„"
