See, I don't know this ""order of operations"" thingy you're talking about.

Okay, so I know what the numbers are, and I know what the signs mean. There's this multiplication sign, which means you have to multiply two numbers together. Then there's this addition sign, which means you gotta add two numbers together. But here's the thing, what order do I do them in? Do I multiply first, or do I add first? That's where this ""PEMDAS"" thing comes in, I guess.

So, I'm gonna start by multiplying 4 and 3 together, 'cause that's what the multiplication sign tells me to do. That gives me 12. Now, I gotta add 2 to that, so I get 14. And that's my answer! Woohoo! The answer is 14.

But wait, you're saying that's not right? That I gotta follow this ""order of operations"" thingy? Okay, okay, I hear ya. So, I gotta follow these steps: first, I gotta multiply 4 and 3 together, then I gotta add 2 to that. Which means... uh... okay, so that's 12 + 2, which is... *drumroll* 14!

Then, we add 5 and 8, and that gives us... 13!

The answer is 13."

First, I know that when we have multiply numbers, we have to do it in a special order. So, I will start by multiplying 7 and 2, and that gives me 14.

Next, I will multiply 8 and 5, and that gives me 40.

Now, I need to add 14 and 40, and that gives me 54.

The answer is 54!"

Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 multiplied by something. That something looks like 2 plus 5, which is 7. So, I multi-ply 4 by 7, and I get 28.

Next, I see a 12. I don't know what to do with it, but it looks like it's just hanging out there by itself. So, I'll just leave it alone for now.

Now, I see a minus sign! That means I have to subtract something, right? I see 2 times 3, which is 6. So, I subtract 6 from 28, and I get 22.

But wait, there's more! I see a plus sign too! That means I have to add something. I see a 12 hanging out there, so I'll add it to 22. That gives me 34.

The answer is 34!

I hope that's right, and I hope I didn't mess up anywhere. I'll ask my teacher to check my work!"
