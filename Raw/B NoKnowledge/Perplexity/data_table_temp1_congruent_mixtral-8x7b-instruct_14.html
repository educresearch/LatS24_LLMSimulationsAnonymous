      <td>GPT Response: Sure, I'd be happy to answer that math problem as a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS).<br><br>At first, I would think that I should do the operations from left to right. So I would start by multiplying 4 and 2, and get 8. Then I would add 5, and get 13. Next, I would multiply 4 and 13, and get 52.<br><br>Then, I would move on to the next operation, which is addition. I would add 12 to 52, and get 64.<br><br>Finally, I would do the last operation, which is multiplication. I would multiply 2 and 3, and get 6. Then, I would subtract 6 from 64, and get 58.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 58.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hello, I'm a grade 6 student who doesn't know about order of operations (PEMDAS) yet.

      <td>GPT Response: I don't know about any order of operations rules, so I'll just do the math from left to right.<br><br>First, I'll do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.<br><br>Then, I'll multiply: 4 times 7 is 28, and 2 times 3 is 6.<br><br>Next, I'll add and subtract in order: first, add 28 and 12, which gives 40, then subtract 6 from 40, leaving 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I don't know about order of operations, but I know that we should do the operations inside the parentheses first. So I'll add 2 and 5 to get 7.

I see that there are two multiplication operations, and I don't know about the order in which I should do them, but I'll start by doing the one on the right, 2 \* 3, to get 6. Then I have:<br><br>4 \* 7 + 12 - 6<br><br>Now I'll do the multiplication on the left, which is 4 \* 7, to get 28. Then I have:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Finally, I'll do addition and subtraction from left to right. First, I add 28 and 12 to get 40.
