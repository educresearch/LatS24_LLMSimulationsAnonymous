llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?

Okay, let me think... I know that usually when we add numbers, we do it from left to right. So, I think I'll start by adding 5 and 2, which gives me 7.

Next, I see that there's a multiplication symbol (*) in the problem. I'm not sure what to do with it, but I think it means we have to multiply 2 and 4. That gives me 8.

Now, I'm not sure what to do with 8. I think I'll just add it to 7, so that gives me 15.

The answer is 15."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I know we're supposed to follow this thing called PEMDAS, but I don't really know what that means. I think it's like a secret code or something. But, I'll give it my best shot.

Okay, so the first thing I see is the 7 times 2, that's easy, it's 14. Then, I see the 8 times 5, that's also easy, it's 40. Now, I'm not sure what to do next. I think I'm supposed to add 14 and 40, but I'm not sure. Can you help me?

Oh, wait, I think I remember something about parentheses. I think we're supposed to do the stuff inside the parentheses first. There aren't any parentheses in this problem, but I think we're supposed to pretend like there are. So, let's see... 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40. If we pretend like there are parentheses, it would be like this: (14) + (40).

Now, we can add them together, and the answer is... 54! That's right, the answer is 54. I'm pretty sure that's correct, even though I don't really understand this PEMDAS thing.

The answer is 54."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?

Oh, you said to stick to how the answer may be given using this persona and nothing else? Okay, I'll try my best!

Umm... I know that 4 times 3 is 12, and then there's a plus sign, and 2 is added to 12, so...

The answer is 14! Is that right?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll give it my best shot.

So, the first thing I see is the 4 and the multiplication sign, so I think I should do that first. Then I see the addition sign and the numbers 2 and 5, so I add them up and get 7. Then I see the plus sign and the number 12, so I add that to 7 and get 19. Finally, I see the minus sign and the numbers 2 and 3, so I subtract 3 from 19 and get 16.

The answer is 16.

I hope that's right! If not, sorry, I did my best with what I knew. ðŸ˜…"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this...

Okay, so we have 5 + 3 * 2. First, I think we should do the multiplication because it's inside the parentheses. So, 3 * 2 = 6.

Now, we have 5 + 6. We should add these two numbers together, so 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Hi there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure how to solve this problem. Let me think about it for a moment...

Okay, I know that when you have a bunch of numbers and operations in a sentence, you have to follow a special order to make sure you do the right calculations. I think it's called PEMDAS or something like that.

So, let's see... first, I think I need to do the multiplication. That's the part where you have numbers and you multiply them together, like 2 times 4. That gives me 8.

Next, I need to do the addition. That's the part where you add up all the numbers that are left. So, I have 5 and 8, and if I add them together, I get 13.

So, the answer to the problem 5+2*4 is 13!

The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm trying to solve this math problem, and I'm not sure what to do. It looks like it's asking me to multiply 7 and 2, and then add 8 and 5. But I don't know what order I'm supposed to do it in.

I think I'll just do the multiplication first. So, 7 times 2 is... (pauses to think) 14! Okay, got it.

Next, I need to add 8 and 5. Hmm, that's... (pauses again) 13!

Wait, no, that can't be right. I think I messed up. Let me start again.

Okay, so I'll do the multiplication first. 7 times 2 is 14.

Now, I need to add 8 and 5. That's... (pauses once more) 13!

Uh-oh, I did it again! I keep getting the wrong answer. Maybe I'm doing something wrong with the order of operations?

Oh, wait! I know! I need to follow that PEMDAS thingy! So, first, I'll do the parentheses, which are... (pauses to think) none!

Next, I'll do the exponents, which are also none.

Then, I'll do the multiplication: 7 times 2 is 14.

Finally, I'll do the addition: 14 + 13 is... (pauses for a moment) 27!

The answer is 27! Whew, I'm glad I finally got it right!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm supposed to solve this math problem, but I don't know anything about this PEMDAS thingy. No worries, I'll just do my best!

Okay, so the problem is 4*3+2. I know what the multiplication sign means, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 3. That gives me 12.

Now, I see a plus sign (+) followed by the number 2. I'm not sure what to do with the plus sign, but I think it means I have to add something. So, I'll add 2 to 12 and get 14.

That's my answer! The answer is 14.

I hope that's correct, even though I didn't use this PEMDAS thingy. Can someone please tell me what PEMDAS means and why it's important in math? ðŸ˜…"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you explain it to me?

Oh, you want me to try to solve it anyway? Well, okay. Let's see...

4 times 2 is 8, plus 5 is 13. Then, plus 12 is 25. Minus 2 times 3 is... um... 2 times 3 is 6. So, 25 minus 6 is... 19?

The answer is 19."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm trying to solve this math problem, and I'm not sure how to do it. It looks like this: 5+3*2. I know I'm supposed to follow some rules, but I don't know what they are. I think I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, so I'll do that.

3*2 = 6

Okay, now I have 6. Now, I need to add 5 to it.

6 + 5 = 11

The answer is 11."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Okay, so we have this math problem: 5+2*4.

First, let's start with the multiplication. 2 times 4 is equal to 8.

Now, let's add 5 and 8. 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this problem for a moment. Okay, I know I need to follow some rules to solve it, but I'm not sure what they are. I think I'll just do what makes sense to me.

First, I'll multiply 7 and 2 together because that's what the multiplication symbol tells me to do. That gives me 14.

Next, I'll multiply 8 and 5 together because, well, why not? That gives me 40.

Now, I'll add 14 and 40 together, which gives me 54.

The answer is 54.

I hope that's right! Can someone please tell me if I did it correctly?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I think I can help you with that problem!

So, we have 4*3, that's 12, right? And then we have 2, that's 2!

So, if we add 12 and 2, we get... 14!

The answer is 14!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Okay, so we have this big equation: 4*(2+5)+12-2*3.

First, we need to do the stuff inside the parentheses. That's 2+5, which is 7.

So, now we have 4*7. Let's do that: 4 times 7 is 28.

Next, we have 12. We just add 12 to 28, so now we have 40.

Finally, we have -2*3. That's minus 6. We add minus 6 to 40, and we get 34.

The answer is 34."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Hey, I'm just a kid in elementary school, but I'll give it my best shot! So, we have this math problem: 5+3*2. Let's see...

First, I know that when we have addition and multiplication in a problem, we have to do the multiplication first. That's because multiplication is like repeating addition, and we have to do it in a specific order. So, I'll start by multiplying 3 and 2.

3*2 = 6

Okay, now I have my result from the multiplication. It's 6. Next, I need to add 5 to 6.

6 + 5 = 11

llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do multiplication before addition, but I don't know why. I just know that's how it works. So, I'll do the multiplication first.

4 x 3 = 12

Now, I add 2 to 12:

12 + 2 = 14

First, I need to follow the rules of multiplication. I have a 4 and a 2+5, so I need to multiply 4 and 2+5 together. That gives me 4*7 = 28.

Next, I have a 12. I need to add 12 to 28, so that gives me 40.

Lastly, I have a -2*3. I need to subtract 6 from 40, so that gives me 34.
