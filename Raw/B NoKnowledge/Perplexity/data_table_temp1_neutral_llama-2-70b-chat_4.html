      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. I think it might be a way to do math problems, but I'm not sure. Can you help me?<br><br>I see a lot of numbers and symbols in the problem, but I don't know what to do with them. I know I need to find the answer, but I don't know how.<br><br>Okay, let me try something. I see a 4 and a 2+5. I think I need to add 2 and 5 first, so that's 7. Then, I need to multiply 4 by 7, which is 28.<br><br>Next, I see a 12. I think I need to add 12 to 28, which is 40.<br><br>Finally, I see a 2 and a 3. I think I need to multiply 2 by 3, which is 6.

      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?<br><br>I see a lot of symbols and numbers in the problem, but I'm not sure what to do with them. Can you explain it to me like I'm five years old?<br><br>Oh, you want me to follow the order of operations? Okay, I think I can do that!<br><br>First, let's do the multiplication: 4 * 2 = 8 and 4 * 5 = 20.<br><br>Next, let's add 8 and 20 together: 8 + 20 = 28.<br><br>After that, we need to subtract 2 times 3: 28 - 6 = 22.<br><br>Finally, we add 12: 22 + 12 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Sure, I can help you with that!<br><br>So, I know that when we do math, we have to follow some rules. My teacher calls it the "order of operations." It's like a recipe for solving problems. First, we do the things inside the parentheses, then we do the exponents (like squaring or cubing), then we do multiplication and division from left to right, and finally, we do addition and subtraction from left to right.<br><br>Okay, let's start with the problem: 4*(2+5)+12-2*3.<br><br>First, I need to do what's inside the parentheses. That's 2+5, which equals 7. So, now my problem looks like this: 4*7+12-2*3.<br><br>Next, I need to do the multiplication. 4*7 is 28. Then, I have 12, which is just a number, not an operation. So, I'll write it down: 28+12.<br><br>Now, I need to do the subtraction. 2*3 is 6, and I need to subtract it from 28+12, which is 40. So, my final answer is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...Okay, I know that when we add numbers, we have to do it from left to right. So, first, I would add 5 and 2, which gives us 7. Then, I would multiply 4 by 7, which gives us 28.<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure about this order of operations thingy. But I'll give it a try!<br><br>So, I see there are a bunch of numbers and symbols here: 5, 2, 4, and "+". I know I have to follow some rules to find the answer, but I'm not sure what they are.<br><br>I think the first thing I should do is add 5 and 2. That gives me 7.<br><br>Next, I see there's a multiplication symbol (*) and some more numbers. I'm not sure what to do with them. I think I should multiply 4 by 2, because that's what the symbol suggests. That gives me 8.<br><br>Now, I have 7 and 8. I'm not sure what to do next. I think I should add them together. So, 7 + 8 = 15.<br><br>The answer is 15!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...<br><br>Okay, I know that when we add numbers, we have to do it in a special order. Like, if we have 2 apples and we add 3 more apples, we get 5 apples. So, in this problem, we have 5 and 2, and we have to add them together. But then we have this funny symbol, *, which means we have to do something called "multiplication" before we add.<br><br>So, let's see... 2 times 4 is equal to 8. Now, we add 5 and 8, and we get... 13!<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do addition and multiplication in a special order, but I don't really know what that order is. I think it's like, do the multiplication first, and then do the addition? So, let's see...<br><br>2*4 is 8.<br><br>Okay, so now I have 5+8, which is 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
