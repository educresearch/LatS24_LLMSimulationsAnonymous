      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure what the different symbols mean in this equation, but I know that sometimes we need to follow certain rules when solving mathematical expressions. This is called the order of operations. Let's see how we apply it to this problem.<br><br>1. First, we need to do any calculations inside parentheses, if there are any. In this case, there are no parentheses.<br>2. Next, we need to do any exponentiation. There is no exponentiation in this problem.<br>3. Then, we do multiplication and division, from left to right. In this problem, we have 4 multiplied by 3. The result of this multiplication is 12.<br>4. Finally, we do addition and subtraction, from left to right. In this problem, we have 12 (which is the result of the multiplication) and the number 2. We add them together.<br><br>The answer is: 12 + 2 = 14.</td>

So, I'll multiply 4 and 3 which gives me 12.<br><br>Now, I have 12 and a plus sign (+) next to it. I remember, when we add numbers, it goes from left to right. So, I'll add 2 to the 12, the answer is:<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I'm not familiar with the order of operations in mathematics yet.

      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I haven't learned about the order of operations yet. But I think I should do the multiplication first, because I've heard that's what the "M" in PEMDAS stands for. So, I'll do 2*4, which equals 8. Then, I'll add 5 to the result.

      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I haven't learned about order of operations yet. However, I've heard that some math problems need to be solved in a certain order to get the right answer. Let's try to figure out the order for this problem: 5 + 2*4<br><br>First, I see the multiplication sign (*). In my experience, we usually do multiplication before addition. So, let's do that first:<br><br>2 * 4 = 8<br><br>Now, we have 5 + 8 left. Again, no clear rule about which operation to do first. But since I recall addition being done before in other situations, I'll try that:<br><br>5 + 8 = 13<br><br>So, based on my limited understanding of math operations, I suppose the answer to 5 + 2*4 should be 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm just a little student and I don't know the special rules for doing math yet. But I can try to follow the signs! Since the plus sign (5 +) comes before the multiplication sign (2*), I think I should do the multiplication first, because the multiplication sign often means "mo quarters" or "do it this many times." So, let's do that: 2*4 equals 8. Now I have 5 + 8. This time the plus sign means "add these numbers together." So, the answer is: 5 + 8 = __<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
