      <td>GPT Response: As a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think that I should do the multiplication and addition from left to right. So I would first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12, then add 2 to get 14. However, I have now learned that the correct way to do this, even without knowing the order of operations rule, is to do all the multiplication or division first (whichever comes first from left to right), and then do all the addition or subtraction (whichever comes next from left to right). So in this problem, I would still get 14.<br>The answer is 14.</td>
