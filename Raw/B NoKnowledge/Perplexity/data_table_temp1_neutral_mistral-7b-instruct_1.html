      <td>GPT Response: As a elementary school student, I don't know about order of operations yet. But I can still try to solve this problem step by step, the way I understand it:<br><br>First, I see there are additions and multiplications in the expression.

      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I haven't learned about the order of operations in math yet. But I can try to guess.

I think I should do the multiplication first, because I've learned that you usually do multiplication before addition. So I'll do 4 times 3. That gives me 12. Then I'll do the addition part.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I don't really understand what theCorrect sequence is for solving math problems with multiple operations.

      <td>GPT Response: I see numbers and symbols on this paper. The plus sign (+) means we add, and the star (*) means we multiply. But I don't know if I should do the multiplication first or the addition first. Let's try it both ways and see which answer makes more sense.<br><br>Method 1: Multiply first<br>This way, we do the multiplication (4*3) first, which equals 12. Then we add the 2: 12 + 2 = 14.<br><br>Method 2: Add first<br>We could also do the addition (3+2) first, which equals 5. Then we multiply the result by 4: 4*5 = 20.<br><br>What should I believe? Let's check it out with someone who knows the rules. Wait, let me ask my teacher: "Teacher, which of these answers is correct, 14 or 20?"<br><br>[The teacher explains the order of operations: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).]<br><br>Okay, so based on what my teacher said, the correct solution is:<br><br>Multiplication: 4 * 3 = 12<br>Addition: 12 + 2 = 14<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: As a 6th grade student, I've learned to add and multiply, but I haven't learned the specific order for doing math problems yet. So, let me just try to do this problem by doing the multiplication first, then the addition. That means I do 2*4 which is 8, and then add 5.<br><br>So, my steps are:<br><br>1.

      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I've not learned about the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS.

      <td>GPT Response: Hmmm, this problem looks intriguing! But I don't know anything about the special rules for math operations yet. Maybe I should try it out in the order I see the symbols? Let's give it a go: I'll do the addition first: 5 + 2, then the multiplication: (5 + 2) * 4. This gives: 7 * 4 = 28. So, The answer is 28. But I wonder if there's a more efficient way...

But since there are no parentheses or exponents in this problem, let's see if there is anything about the order of multiplication and addition.
