      <td>GPT Response: Hmmm, I'm not sure how to do this problem. There are some symbols I see that I think might represent operations, but I'm not sure what the rule is for doing them in the correct order. I guess I'll just try doing them in the order I see them from left to right, which is what I usually do when I have simple addition and multiplication problems. So, I'll do the multiplication first, then the addition.<br><br>First, I'll do the multiplication: 4 &times; 3 = 12<br><br>Now, I'll do the addition: 12 + 2 = 14<br><br>So, the answer is: The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm just a student in elementary school and I'm not sure what "order of operations" means. But I see numbers and symbols, so I think maybe I should do what looks easier first. I'll do the multiplication because I see two numbers being multiplied and that seems simple. So 4 times 3 is 12.<br><br>Now I have 12 and the addition symbol. The addition symbol means you have to put two numbers together. So I'll add 2 to 12.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm a grade 6 student, so I don't really know about complex rules like PEMDAS in math yet.

      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I've learned to add and multiply, but I don't know anything about the order of operations yet. Let's just do this step by step.<br><br>First, we do the multiplication: 2*4 = 8<br><br>Then, we do the addition: 5 + 8<br><br>So, following the steps I know, the answer is: 5 + 8 = 13<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I've seen a number sign, some pluses, and some multiplication sign. I'm not sure what to do first. Maybe I should try this: I'll do the multiplication because it seems to come before the addition in the problem, but I'm not sure why. So let's find out what 2 times 4 is: That's 8. Now I have 5 plus 8. I guess I'll do this from left to right, so the answer would be: <br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I've never heard of PEMDAS or the order of operations rule. I would approach this problem by doing the multiplication first since it's next to the addition sign, and then doing the addition.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I don't really know about these fancy mathematics rules yet, but I've heard my teacher mention something about following a certain order when doing math problems. Let's see if I can figure out this one: I guess I should do the multiplication before the addition, right? So, let's do 3 times 2 first, which equals 6. Then I add 5 to the result, so the answer is 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I wouldn't know about order of operations yet. But I can try to do this math problem in a logical way. I'll do the multiplication first because I see the asterisk symbol (*) for multiplication, so I'll find the product of 3 and 2 which equals 6. Then I'll do the addition since I see the plus sign (+) so I'll add 5 and 6, which equals 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I see some numbers and some math symbols, but I don't know anything about the order of operations yet. So, let me just follow the way the symbols are arranged from left to right. I'll start with the addition sign and then move on to the multiplication sign. That means I'll do the multiplication first and then the addition. But since I don't know the rule for multiplication before addition, let's ask someone who knows better to help us. The answer is: I'm not sure, should ask someone who knows the order of operations.<br><br>The answer is __ (to be determined by someone who knows the order of operations).</td>
