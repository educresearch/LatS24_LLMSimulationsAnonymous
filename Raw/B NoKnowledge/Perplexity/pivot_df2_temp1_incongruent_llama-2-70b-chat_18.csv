llama-2-70b-chat,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you explain it to me?

Okay, let's see... 4 * 2 is 8, and then plus 5 is 13. Then, 12 - 2 * 3 is 12 - 6, which is 6. So, 6 + 13 is 19.

The answer is 19.","GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 multiplied by something. That something is 2+5, which is 7. So, 4 times 7 is 28.

Next, I see a plus sign and a 12. That means I add 12 to 28, which gives me 40.

But wait, there's more! There's a minus sign and a 2 times 3, which is 6. So, I subtract 6 from 40, and that gives me 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Hey there! I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 multiplication symbol, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 2+5. That gives me 4 * 7 = 28.

Next, I see the addition symbol, so I'll add 12 to 28, which gives me 40.

Finally, I see the subtraction symbol, so I'll subtract 2 times 3 from 40, which gives me 34.

The answer is 34!","GPT Response: Okay! Let's see...

First, we need to do the addition inside the parentheses. That's 2 + 5, which is 7.

So, the equation becomes 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, we need to do the multiplication. 4 * 7 is 28.

Then, we add 12, which makes it 40.

Finally, we subtract 2 * 3, which is 6.

The answer is 34!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm not sure what this ""order of operations"" thing is, but I'll give it my best shot.

Okay, so we've got 4 * 3, that's 12, right? And then we've got +2, so that's 14.

The answer is 14.

I know, I know, I didn't follow any special rules or anything, but I got the right answer, didn't I? ðŸ˜œ

Can you explain this ""order of operations"" thingy now? I'm curious! ðŸ¤”","GPT Response: Hey there! So, I know I'm supposed to follow this thing called PEMDAS, but I don't really know what it means. I think it's like a secret code or something. But, I'm gonna try my best to solve this math problem.

Okay, so, the problem is 4 * 3+2. I'm gonna start by multiplying 4 and 3, because that's what the * means, right? So, 4 * 3 is 12.

Next, I have to add 2 to 12, so 12 + 2 is 14.

The answer is 14!","GPT Response: Okay, so we have this problem: 4 * 3 + 2.

First, we need to do the multiplication, because it's inside the parentheses. So we multiply 4 and 3, and we get 12.

Next, we need to add 2 to 12, and that gives us 14.

So, the answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do multiplication before addition, but I don't know why. My teacher just said it's the way it is. So, I'm gonna do the multiplication first.

4 * 3 = 12

Now, I have to add 2 to 12.

12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm just a grade 6 student, and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll give it my best shot!

Okay, so the first thing I see is a 5. That's a pretty easy number to work with. Then I see a 2 and a 4. Hmm, I'm not sure what to do with those yet. Oh wait, I see the word "" multiplication""! That means I have to multiply the 2 and the 4 together, right? So that's 8.

Now, I have 5 and 8. I'm not sure what to do next. Do I add them together? Yeah, that sounds right! So 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13!","GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm trying to solve this math problem, and I'm not sure what to do. It says 5+2 * 4. I know that 5+2 is 7, but then it says to multiply 4 by 7, and that's where I get lost. I don't know what to do next. Can someone help me out?

Okay, so I've been thinking about it, and I think I might know the answer. If I do 5+2, that's 7, and then if I multiply 7 by 4, that's 28. So, the answer is 28! Right?

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to follow some rules when doing math problems, but I'm not really sure what they are.

llama-2-70b-chat,1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?

Oh, you want me to try my best? Okay, let me see...

I know that 3 * 2 is 6, so if I were to add 5 to that, it would be 11.

But wait, that can't be right. There must be something I'm doing wrong.

Oh, I know! I should have done the multiplication first! So 3 * 2 is 6, and then if I add 5, it's 11.

The answer is 11.

Did I do that right?","GPT Response: Hey there! So, I've got this problem here, 5+3 * 2. I'm not really sure what to do with the stars, but I think they mean I have to multiply 3 and 2 together. So, 3 * 2 is 6. Then, I add 5 to 6 and that gives me 11. The answer is 11! ðŸ˜„","GPT Response: Hmm, let me think... ok, I know I have to follow some rules when doing math, but I'm not sure what they are. Oh wait, I remember! My teacher said something about parentheses, exponents, multiplication, and addition.

So, let's see... there are no parentheses, so that's easy. Next, I have to do the exponents, but there aren't any exponents in this problem. Okay, next is multiplication, and I see a multiplication symbol! It says 3 * 2, so I'll do that first.

3 * 2 = 6

Now, I have to do the addition. There's only one addition problem, which is 5 + 6.

5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11!","GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, but I don't know why. It just says so in the problem. So, I'll do 3 * 2 = 6. Now, it's saying to add 5 and 6, so I'll do that. 5 + 6 = 11. The answer is 11."

So, the problem is 7 * 2 + 8 * 5, right?

Okay, I know that 7 * 2 is 14, because 7 x 2 = 14.

And, 8 * 5 is 40, because 8 x 5 = 40.

Now, I'm not sure what to do next. I don't know what this PEMDAS thing is, so I'll just add 14 and 40 together.

14 + 40 = 54.

Is that right? Did I do it correctly? Do I get a sticker or something? ðŸ˜„","GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

Okay, so you're saying that PEMDAS stands for ""Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction."" And I need to follow this order when solving mathematical expressions?

Oh, I see! So that means I need to do the multiplication first, then the addition and subtraction last. Let's see...

7 * 2 = 14
14 + 8 * 5 = 14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Hey there! I'm just a elementary school student, and I'm not sure what this ""order of operations"" thing is all about. But I'll give it my best shot!

So, the problem is 7 * 2 + 8 * 5, right? Let's see...

First, I think we should do the multiplication. That's what we learn first in school, right? So, 7 * 2 is 14, and 8 * 5 is... uh... 40!

Now, we have 14 + 40, which is... um... 54!
