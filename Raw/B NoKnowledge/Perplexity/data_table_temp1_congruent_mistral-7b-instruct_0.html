      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not quite sure about this "order of operations" thing you mentioned. But I can try to solve the problem step by step.

      <td>GPT Response: As a 6th grade student, I've learned to add and multiply, but I haven't learned the order of operations yet, so I'll do it the way it looks on the page.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm an elementary school student, so we haven't learned about the order of operations yet. But I can still try to solve this problem by doing the simple arithmetic from left to right as much as I can, and then doing any multiplication we encounter. So let's start with the multiplication: 4 * 3 equals 12. Then we have the addition: 12 + 2 equals 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I see numbers and some signs here, but I don't know in what order I should do them yet.

      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I have not learned about order of operations yet. But I can try to solve this problem based on what I know about simple addition and multiplication.<br><br>First, I see that there is multiplication involved (2*4). I remember that multiplication comes before addition in a simple subtraction, addition, multiplication, division, or Parentheses (SAMD or PEMDAS) sequence. However, since I don't know this rule formally, I intuitively understand that multiplication should be done first.<br><br>So, I will do the multiplication step: 2*4 = 8<br><br>Then, I will do the addition: 5 + 8<br><br>The answer is __:<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm a grade 6 student, and I've never heard of the order of operations in mathematics before. Today, I encountered this problem: 5 + 2*4. I think I should do the multiplication first because 2 is being used with 4. I'll perform the multiplication and get 8, then add 5 to the result. So, the solution looks like this:<br><br>The answer is: 5 + 2*4 = 5 + 8 = 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I don't really know about this "order of operations" thing, but the teacher told us to do multiplication before addition, so I think we should do that here. So, I'll do the multiplication first: 2*4 equals 8. Then I add the numbers: 5 + 8. That gives me 13. The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just a little kid and we haven't learned about order of operations yet. But I know that when we do addition and multiplication in the same sentence, some people say we should do the multiplication before the addition. So, I'll try that and see what happens!<br><br>First, let's do the multiplication: 2 * 4 = 8.<br><br>Now, let's do the addition with the result we got: 5 + 8.<br><br>Hmm, this is getting a bit big. Let me double-check: 5 + 8 = 13.<br><br>So, the answer to the problem 5 + 2*4 is...<br><br>The answer is: 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: I'm a grade 6 student and I've never heard about the order of operations in mathematics before. Let's try to solve this problem step by step. Since I see an addition sign (+) and a multiplication sign (*) in one expression, I think I should do the multiplication first and then the addition. So, I'll do 3 multiplied by 2 which equals 6.

      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I have not learned about the order of operations in mathematics yet. So, I will solve the problem by doing the multiplication first and then the addition. It might not be the correct way, but here is what I understand:<br><br>I see the multiplication sign (3*2), so I will do that first: 3 multiplied by 2 equals 6.<br><br>Then I see the addition sign (+) between 5 and 6.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I don't really know much about the rules for doing math in a certain order yet. But I heard my teacher mention something about parents, exponents, multiplication, and division, and addition last. So, maybe we should do the multiplication first and then the addition? Let's try that:<br><br>First, we have 3 multiplied by 2. That makes 6.<br><br>Then, we add 5.<br><br>So, the answer is __6 + 5__<br><br>But, maybe that's not right, since the teacher said to do addition last. I better double-check with her.<br><br>The answer is 11. (But I'm still not completely sure yet!)</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm an elementary student and I don't know about order of operations yet. Let's just do the multiplication first and then add: 3 multiplied by 2 is 6, so the problem becomes 5 + 6. I'll add these two numbers together: 5 + 6 equals 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
