llama-2-70b-chat,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this ""PEMDAS"" thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 multiplication sign, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 2+5. That gives me 4*7 = 28.

Next, I see the 12 addition sign, so I'll add 28 and 12, which gives me 40.

After that, I see the 2 multiplication sign, so I'll multiply 2 and 3, which gives me 6.

Finally, I see the minus sign, so I'll subtract 6 from 40, which gives me 34.

The answer is 34.

I hope that's correct! Can you help me learn more about this PEMDAS thing?","GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

Okay, so I see a bunch of numbers and symbols here. Let's start with the multiplication. I know that 4 times 2 is 8, and 4 times 5 is 20. So, 4*(2+5) is 8 + 20 = 28.

Next, I see a plus sign and a minus sign. I'm not sure what order I'm supposed to do these in, but I'll just do them from left to right. So, 28 + 12 = 40.

Finally, there's a minus sign and a 3. I know that 3 times 2 is 6, so 2*3 is 6. But then I have to subtract 6 from 40, which gives me 34.

So, the answer is 34!","GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm not supposed to know anything about order of operations, but my teacher always says "" Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction"" 
                                                                                                                                                       when she writes it, it looks like PEMDAS   

Okay, so in the problem 4*(2+5)+12-2*3     
I think we should do the addition inside the parentheses first, that's what my teacher always says     
So the first thing that we need to do is 2+5 = 7 
                                                       
Next, we multiply 4 by 7 = 28 
                                                      
Then, we add 12 = 40 
                                                     
Next, we minus 2 times 3 = 6 
                                                    
So the final answer is 40 - 6 = 34. 
The answer is 34.           ","GPT Response: Okay, I'll give it a try!

First, I see some parentheses, so I need to do what's inside them first. That's 2+5, which is 7.

Next, I see a multiplication sign, so I'll do that next. 4 times 7 is 28.

After that, I see another multiplication sign, so I'll do that next. 2 times 3 is 6.

Finally, I see a subtraction sign, so I'll do that last. 28 minus 6 is 22.

The answer is 22."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let's see... I know I have to follow some rules to solve this problem, but I'm not really sure what they are. I think I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 3. That gives me 12.

Next, I need to add 2 to 12. That's easy, so I get 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Hi there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

First, I see a multiplication sign, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 3. That gives me 12.

Next, I see a plus sign, so I'll add 2 to 12. That gives me 14.

So, the answer is 14!

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

First, I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 3. That gives me 12.

Next, I have 2 left over, so I'll add that to 12. That makes 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do something with numbers, but I'm not sure what. Let's see... 4 times 3 is... umm... 12? I think? And then there's a plus sign, so that means I have to add something. Oh, yeah! 2! I know that 2 plus 12 is 14. So, the answer is 14!

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to follow this thing called PEMDAS, but I don't really know what that means. I think it's like a robot that helps us do math or something? Anyway, my teacher said to follow some steps when we do math, so I'll try my best!

First, I see a 5. That's easy, I know what that means! It means we have 5 things. Like, if I had 5 pencils, that would be cool.

Next, I see a 2. That's not too hard either! That means we have 2 groups of things. Like, if I had 2 groups of 5 pencils, that would be 10 pencils!

Oh, wait, there's more! There's a * symbol. That means we have to multiply, right? So, 2 groups of 5 pencils means we have 10 pencils. But wait, there's a 4 here too! That means we have to multiply 2 groups of 5 pencils by 4! That's like... 20 pencils?!

But wait, there's one more thing! There's a + sign! That means we have to add something. So, we have 20 pencils, and we have to add 5 more pencils. That's like... 25 pencils!

The answer is 25.

I hope that's right! Math is kind of confusing, but I think I'm getting the hang of it. Can I have a sticker now?","GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to follow some rules when doing math, but I don't really know what they are. I think it's something like ""do the things inside the parentheses first""? But there aren't any parentheses here, so I'm not sure what to do.

Oh wait, I remember! We're supposed to do the multiplication before the addition! So, let's see... 2 times 4 is... carry the 1... 8! And then we add 5 to that, so... 13!

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: Okay, so we have a math problem that looks like this: 5+2*4.

First, I know that the * means multiplication, so I'd do that part first. 2 times 4 is 8.

Now, it looks like this: 5 + 8.

Next, I know that the + means addition, so I'd do that part next. 5 plus 8 is 13.

So, the answer is 13!","GPT Response: Hi! I'm a student in elementary school and I'm not sure what the order of operations is. But I think I can solve this problem by just doing the multiplication first.

So, 2 times 4 is 8.

Then, 5 plus 8 is 13.

The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, we've got this math problem here, 5+3*2. Now, I'm not sure what this ""PEMDAS"" thingy is, but I'll give it my best shot.

Okay, so first, we've got the 5. That's easy. Then, we've got the 3, and it's multiplying something. I'm not sure what that means, but I think it means we have to do the multiplication first. So, 3 multiplied by 2 is 6.

Now, we add the 5 and the 6, and that gives us... umm... 11!

The answer is 11.

I hope that's right! Do you think that's right?","GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. I think it might be a trick question. Can you give me a hint?

Okay, I'll try my best. I think I need to do the multiplication first. So, 3*2 = 6. Then, I add 5 to 6 and get 11. The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Hmm, let me think... Okay, I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll do the multiplication first.

3*2 = 6

Now, I add 5 and 6:

5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, but I don't know why. Can someone explain it to me?

Okay, so if I have 3 groups of 2 things, that's 6 things in total, right? Like 3 groups of 2 apples is 6 apples.

So, 3*2 means 3 groups of 2 things, which is 6 things.

Now, if I have 5 apples and I add 6 apples, that's 11 apples!

The answer is 11.

Can someone please tell me why we do the multiplication first? I'm still a little confused."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to follow some rules when doing math, but I don't really know what they are. I think I'm supposed to do the multiplication first? So, I'll do the multiplication and then add stuff up.

7*2 is 14.
8*5 is 40.

Now, I add 14 and 40, which is 54.

The answer is 54.

Wait, that can't be right. I think I might've done something wrong. Maybe I'm supposed to do the addition before the multiplication? Or maybe I'm supposed to do the multiplication in a different order? I'm so confused!

Oh well, I hope someone can help me figure it out.","GPT Response: Hi there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

Okay, so the problem is 7*2+8*5. I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll do the multiplications first.

7*2 is 14, and 8*5 is 40.

I hope that's right! Can you tell me if I did it correctly?","GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this problem for a bit. Okay, I know that when we have numbers being multiplied together, we need to do those first. So, I'll start by multiplying 7 and 2 together, that gives me 14.
