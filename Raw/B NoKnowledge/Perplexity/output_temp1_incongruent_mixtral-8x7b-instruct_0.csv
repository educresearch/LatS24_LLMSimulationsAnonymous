But I know my answer should have just one digit because there's only one number in the question with more than one digit. So I need to check with my teacher or the grown-ups about this new thing called ""order of operations"" to be sure.

But if I had to guess again without knowing about it, I would try to do the multiplication and addition at the same time, but that doesn't make sense. So I'll just stick with my first guess of 14 for now.

The answer is 14."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: Oh boy, this looks like a fun math problem! But I'm just an elementary school student and I don't know about order of operations yet. I think I should ask my teacher about something called ""BIDMAS"" or ""PEMDAS"" which tells you how to solve these kinds of problems.

Okay, I asked my teacher and she said BIDMAS/PEMDAS stands for Brackets/Parentheses, Indices/Exponents, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). That sounds like a mouthful, but I get it! We need to solve the problem step-by-step in that order.

1. First, I see there are parentheses, so I'll do the operation inside: 2 + 5 = 7.
2. Now the problem looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.
3. Next, I see multiplication and division, so I'll do those: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6.
4. The problem now looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.
5. Lastly, I see addition and subtraction, so I'll do those from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40 and then 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34."
