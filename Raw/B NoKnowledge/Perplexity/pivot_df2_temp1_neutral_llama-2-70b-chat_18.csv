llama-2-70b-chat,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it my best shot.

So, I see a bunch of numbers and symbols here, and I think I know how to do some of them. Let's start with the multiplication. I know that 4 times 2 is 8, and 8 times 5 is 40. Oh, wait, there's more! There's a plus sign and some more numbers. Let's see... 12 plus 40 is... hmm, I think that's 52.

But wait, there's a minus sign too! Minus 2 times 3 is... minus 6. So, 52 minus 6 is... 46!

The answer is 46.

Did I do that right? Do I get a sticker? ðŸ˜„","GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?

Okay, let's see... 4 times 2 is 8, plus 5 is 13, plus 12 is 25, minus 2 times 3 is 25 - 6, which is... 19!

The answer is 19! ","GPT Response: Okay, so we have this big equation: 4*(2+5)+12-2*3. Let's start by doing the stuff inside the parentheses. We have 2+5, which is 7. So, the equation becomes 4*7+12-2*3. Now, we multiply 4 and 7, which gives us 28. Next, we add 12, which makes it 40. Finally, we subtract 2 times 3, which is 6. Therefore, the answer is 40-6, which is 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Okay, I'll try my best!

First, I know that when we have parentheses, we have to do what's inside them first. So, I'll start by adding 2 and 5.

2 + 5 = 7

Next, I'll multiply 4 by 7.

4 * 7 = 28

Now, I'll add 12 to 28.

28 + 12 = 40

Finally, I'll subtract 2 times 3 from 40.

40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll do the multiplication first.
4 times 3 is 12.

Now, I have 12 + 2, which is 14.

So, the answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you explain it to me?

Oh, you want me to try and solve it anyway? Well, OK. Let me see... 4 times 3 is 12, and then if we add 2, that makes 14. So, the answer is 14. Is that right?

I'm not sure if that's correct because like I said, I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me learn it so I can do problems like this better next time?

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll do the multiplication first. 4 times 3 is 12.

Then, I have to add 2 to 12, so that's 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Okay! So, I know that when we do math, we have to follow some rules. One of those rules is that we have to do the things that are inside the parentheses first. In this problem, there are no parentheses, so we can start by multiplying 4 and 3.

4 x 3 = 12

Next, we have to add 2 to 12.

12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Hey, I'm glad you asked me that question! I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I do know how to solve the problem. So, let's see...

First, I would add 5 and 2, which gives me 7.

Then, I would multiply 7 by 4, which gives me 28.

Therefore, the answer is 28!

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Hi there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure how to solve this problem. I know I need to follow some steps, but I don't know what they are. Can you help me?

Okay, let's see... I know I need to do the multiplication first. So, 2 times 4 is 8.

Next, I need to add 5 and 8. That's 13.

The answer is 13!","GPT Response: Oh, wow! That's a really cool problem! Um, so, let's see... we have some numbers and signs here. I know I can add 5 and 2, and that's easy, it's 7! But then there's this funny symbol that looks like a cross, and I'm not sure what it means. I think it's called multiplication or something? So, I'm gonna guess that it means we have to multiply 2 and 4 together, and that's 8! And then, we add the 7 and the 8 together, and that's... hmm... 15! The answer is 15! ðŸ˜Š","GPT Response: Okay, so I know that when we do math, we have to follow some rules. One of those rules is that we have to do things in a certain order. It's like following a recipe to make a delicious meal.

So, let's look at the problem: 5+2*4. I know that the * means we have to multiply, and that's what we do first. So, I'm going to multiply 2 and 4, and that gives me 8.

Now, I have 5 and 8. I need to add them together, so I'll add 5 and 8, and that gives me 13.

The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to follow some rules when doing math problems, but I don't really know what they are. I'll just do my best!

Okay, so first I see a 5. That's a pretty easy number, so I'll start with that. The answer is 5.

Wait, there's more! There's a 3 and a 2. I know I'm supposed to do something with them, but I'm not sure what. I think I'm supposed to multiply them or something? So, I'll do that. 3 times 2 is... hmm... 6!

So, the answer is 5 + 6, which is... 11!

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Hey there! So, I've got this math problem that says 5+3*2. Now, I don't know much about this order of operations thing, but I do know that we have to follow some rules to solve it. So, let's see...

First, I think we should do the multiplication because it's inside the parentheses. That gives us 3*2 = 6.

Next, we add 5 to 6, and that gives us 11.

So, the answer is 11! That's what I think, at least. Can you help me out, teacher?","GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know I have to follow some rules to solve this problem. I think it's supposed to be like a recipe or something. So, I'll follow the rules and see what happens!

First, I have to do the things that are inside the parentheses. That's what my teacher said. So, I'll do the multiplication first.

3*2 = 6

Next, I have to add 5 and 6. That's easy!

5 + 6 = 11

So, the answer is 11!

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Okay, I'll give it a try!

So, we have 5 plus 3 times 2, right?

First, I think we should do the times part, which is 3 times 2, because that's what we do first when we're doing math.

3 times 2 is 6.

Now, we have 5 plus 6, which is 11.

The answer is 11.

Can you help me check if I got it right?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think... Ok, I know I have to follow some rules to find the answer. I think it's like this: first, you do the multiplication, then you do the addition. So, that means I have to do 7*2 first, which is 14. Then, I have to do 8*5, which is 40. After that, I add 14 and 40, which is 54.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll give it my best shot!

Okay, so the problem is 7*2+8*5. I know that 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40. So, if I add them together, I get 54.

The answer is 54!","GPT Response: Hey, I'm not sure how to do this thing with the letters and the numbers. Can you help me out? So, it says 7*2 and that means we have to multiply 7 and 2, right? And then it says plus 8*5, so we have to add 8 times 5 to that. Is that right? I'm really not sure what to do next.

Okay, so if we multiply 7 and 2, we get 14. Then, if we add 8 times 5, that's 40. So, the answer is... 14 + 40 = 54! The answer is 54!","GPT Response: Okay, I'm going to try my best to solve this problem!
