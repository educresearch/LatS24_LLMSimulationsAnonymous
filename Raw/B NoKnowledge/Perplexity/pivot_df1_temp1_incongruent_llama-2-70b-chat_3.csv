llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure how to do this problem, but I think we're supposed to follow some rules called PEMDAS or something. So, I'll try my best!

First, I think we're supposed to do the multiplication before the addition. That means we need to multiply 2 and 4, which gives us 8.

Next, we need to add 5 and 8, which gives us 13.

So, the answer is 13!

The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm not really sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it my best shot.

Okay, so the first thing I see is the 7 * 2, which is 14. Then, there's the 8 * 5, which is 40.

I'm not sure what to do next, but it looks like I have to add 14 and 40 together, so that's 54.

So, the answer is 54!

The answer is 54."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to follow some rules when doing math problems, but I'm not really sure what they are. I think I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, so I'll do that.

4 * 3 = 12

Now, I think I'm supposed to do the addition next.

12 + 2 = 14

So, the answer is 14!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Hi there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure how to solve this problem using order of operations. Can you help me?

Okay, so I know that we have to follow some steps to solve this problem. First, we have to do the stuff inside the parentheses, right? So, that's 2+5, which is 7.

Then, we have to do the multiplication. We have to multiply 4 by 7, which is 28.

Next, we have to do the addition and subtraction. We have to add 12 to 28, which is 40. Then, we have to subtract 2 times 3, which is 6.

So, the final answer is 40 - 6, which is 34.

The answer is 34."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Hmm, this question looks a bit tricky! Okay, let me think...

First, I know that addition comes before multiplication, so I'll do the addition part first. 5 + 3 = 8.

Now, I need to multiply 2 by something. I see that there's a 3 in the equation, so I'll multiply 2 by 3. 2 Ã— 3 = 6.

Now, I need to add 8 and 6. 8 + 6 = 14!

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll give it my best shot!

Okay, so the problem is 5+2 * 4. I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll do the multiplication first.

2 * 4 = 8

Now, I add 5 to 8:

8 + 5 = 13

The answer is 13!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it my best shot.

Okay, so the problem is 7 * 2 + 8 * 5. I know that multiplication comes before addition, so let's start by multiplying 7 and 2. That gives us 14.

Next, we multiply 8 and 5, which gives us 40.

Now, we add 14 and 40, which gives us 54.

The answer is 54!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm trying to solve this math problem, and I'm not sure what to do. It says 4 * 3+2. I know what multiplication and addition are, but I don't know what to do first. I think I should multiply 4 and 3 first, because that's what the multiplication symbol means, right? So, that's 12. Then, I need to add 2 to 12, and that's 14. The answer is 14!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 multiplied by something. That something looks like 2 + 5. Let's see... 2 + 5 is equal to 7, right? So, 4 times 7 is... hmm... 28!

But wait, there's more! After that, there's a plus sign and a 12. That means I have to add 12 to 28, which gives me... 40!

Oh, but there's one more thing. There's a minus sign and a 2 times 3. That means I have to subtract 6 from 40, which gives me... 34!

The answer is 34."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But let's give it a try!

So, 5 + 3 is 8, and then we multiply 8 by 2, which gives us 16.

The answer is 16!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?

Okay, I think I know how to do it now. First, I would add 5 + 2, which is 7. Then, I would multiply 7 by 4, which is 28.

The answer is 28."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll try my best to solve the problem!

First, I'll multiply 7 by 2, that's 14.
Then, I'll multiply 8 by 5, that's 40.
Next, I'll add 14 and 40, that's 54.

So, the answer is 54!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, so we have 4 * 3, that's 12, right?
And then we have 2, that's 2.
So, if we add 2 to 12, that's 14!

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Okay, so we have this big equation: 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3. Let's see...

First, we need to do the thing inside the parentheses. That's 2+5, which is 7. So, now we have 4 * 7.

Next, we need to do the addition and subtraction from left to right. We have 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Now, we can do the multiplication. 4 * 7 is 28.

Next, we add 12, which makes it 40.

Finally, we subtract 2 * 3, which is 6.

The answer is 40 - 6, which is 34.

So, the answer is 34."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that the multiplication symbol comes before the addition symbol in the question, so I'll do the multiplication first.

3 * 2 = 6

Now, I need to add 5 and 6.

5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Okay, let's see... 5 + 2 is 7, and 7 * 4 is 28. So, the answer is 28.

The answer is 28."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Okay, so we have this really cool math problem! It's like a puzzle, right? We have these numbers and we need to figure out what they mean. So, let's see...

First, we have the number 7. That's a pretty big number, isn't it? And then we have this multiplication symbol, which means we need to do some repeated addition. So, we take 7 and multiply it by 2, and that gives us... (counting on fingers) 14! Yeah, that's right!

But wait, there's more! We have another multiplication symbol, and this time it's 8! Wow, that's a big number too! And we need to multiply it by 5. Hmm... (counting on fingers again) Let's see, 8, 13, 18, 23... and 28! Yeah, that's right!

Now, we need to add all these numbers together. So, let's see... 14 + 28 = ... (counting on fingers again) 42! Yeah, that's right!

The answer is 42. Woohoo! I love solving math puzzles!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Okay! Let's see... 4 times 3 is 12, and then we add 2, so that's 14. The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Okay! Let's see...

First, we need to do the addition inside the parentheses. 2 + 5 = 7.

Now, we can multiply 4 by 7. 4 * 7 = 28.

Next, we need to subtract 2 times 3. 28 - 6 = 22.

Finally, we add 12 to 22. 22 + 12 = 34.

The answer is 34."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, we've got this math problem here, and I'm gonna try my best to solve it. Let's see...

Okay, so first, we've got that 5. That's a pretty easy number to work with. Then, we've got that 3, and it's multiplying something. I'm not sure what that means, but I think it means we have to do some kind of special math thing. Like, maybe we have to add 3 and 2 together? But that doesn't seem right...

Oh, wait! I know! The special math thing is called multiplication! That means we have to add 3 groups of 2 together! That's like, 3 + 3 + 3, which is 9!

So, the answer is 9!

The answer is 9."
