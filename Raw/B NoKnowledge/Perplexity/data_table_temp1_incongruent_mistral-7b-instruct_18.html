      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations in mathematics, also known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction). However, I can attempt to solve the problem by trying to follow a logical sequence that seems sensible to me.<br><br>First, I'll look for any parentheses or numbers inside parentheses since we thought they should be done first. But there are no parentheses in this problem, so let's move on to the next step.<br><br>I'll then try to do any multiplication and division from left to right since we learned that those should be done next, right? In this problem, we have: 4 * 2+5 and 2 * 3. Let's tackle the first one, 4 * 2+5. Since we've learned that multiplication comes before addition, I'll do the multiplication first: 4 * 2 = 8, so now it's 8+5. Adding those two numbers, I get 13. So the first part of the equation is now 13.<br><br>Next, we have 2 * 3. I'll apply the same logic, but since I haven't learned that multiplication is commutative, I must do multiplication with the number on the left first: 2 * 3 = 6.<br><br>Alright, I've done what I believe to be the multiplication part of the problem. The next steps in the equation include addition and subtraction. Let's add and subtract from left to right. I'll start with subtracting 2 from 13: 13-2 = 11. Now I have 11, and the problem asks me to add 12: 11+12 = 23.<br><br>So, based on my logical understanding as a 6th-grade student, The answer is 23. But I'm sure a teacher or my older classmates would tell me it's not exactly right despite following a logical sequence. I guess I'll have to learn the official order of operations called PEMDAS to accurately solve these kinds of problems!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I don't know about the order of operations yet. But let me try to solve the problem step by step, trying to make it clear.<br><br>First, I see there are parentheses, so I'll do the calculation inside first:<br><br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now, I have 4 * 7 + 12 and 2 * 3. I'll do the multiplication first:<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>Next, I'll do the addition and subtraction in each part:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 = 28 + 12 = 40<br>6<br><br>The final answer should be the sum of these two parts:<br><br>The answer is 40 + 6 = 46.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations in mathematics, which is denoted by PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction).

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm in grade 6 and I've never heard of this thing called PEMDAS or order of operations. But I see there are some numbers and signs in this math problem. Let's try to figure it out.<br><br>I know that when you do addition and subtraction, you should do it from left to right. And when you do multiplication and division, you should do it from left to right as well, but you should actually do the multiplication and division before the addition and subtraction, right? At least that's what my teacher tells me when she does the math problems on the board.<br><br>So, let's apply that to this problem: 5 + 2 * 4. First, I see the multiplication sign (*) between 2 and 4. I think I should do that first because it's a multiplication, and according to what my teacher says, I should do multiplication before addition. So I'll do 2 * 4, which equals 8.<br><br>Now, I have 5 + 8. I think I should do the addition next since that's what I do from left to right when adding numbers.
