      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't know about order of operations yet. So, I would do each operation as I see it from left to right, just like reading a sentence. Let's give it a try:<br><br>First, we have the parentheses: <br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now, we have multiplication:<br>4 * 7 = 28<br><br>Then, we have another multiplication:<br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>Lastly, addition and subtraction:<br>28 + 12 = 40 (addition)<br>40 - 6 = 34 (subtraction)<br><br>So, according to my understanding without considering order of operations, the answer is 34.

But let's try to make sense of this expression step by step.<br><br>The expression given is "4 * 3 + 2". I see two operations here: multiplication and addition. Usually, we do the multiplication first and then the addition. But I'm not sure if this is a rule or just a common practice, so let's finish the multiplication part first:<br><br>4 * 3 = 12<br><br>Now, we're left with the addition part:<br><br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>So, The answer is __.<br>14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I don't really know what order of operations means. But, I see there are some numbers and symbols in this equation. I think I should do the multiplication first since there are two numbers being multiplied, and then add the result to the number next to it. So, I'll do 4 times 3 first, which equals 12.

So, let me just try doing the multiplication first and then the addition. That means I'll calculate 4 * 3 first, and then add 2 to the result. Let's see, 4 multiplied by 3 is 12. Now, I add 2 to 12.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm a grade 6 student and I've never heard about those letters, PEMDAS or anything like that in math. But I've been told that when we have an expression with multiple operations, we need to follow some rules to find the answer correctly. This is what I understand:<br><br>We should do the multiplication before adding since you know, "times" comes before "plus" in English, right? So, first, I'll do the multiplication part: <br><br>2 * 4 = 8<br><br>Then, I'll add the numbers:<br><br>5 + 8 = 13<br><br>The answer is: The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I've learned some basic mathematcal operations like addition and multiplication. However, I didn't learn about the order of operations yet, so I'll try to solve this problem by doing what seems logical to me. But remember, my solution might not be the correct one according to the rules of PEMDAS.<br><br>Since the multiplication symbol (*) appears before the addition symbol (+), I think I should do the multiplication first, because I've been taught that multiplication comes before addition. So, I'll calculate 2 * 4, which equals 8.<br><br>Then, I have 5 + 8. I know that when I add numbers together, I start with the first number and add the second number to it. So, I'll add 5 and 8, which equals 13.<br><br>So, here's what I think the solution is:<br><br>Step 1: 2 * 4 = 8<br>Step 2: 5 + 8 = 13<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I don't really know about order of operations in mathematics yet, but I can try to guess how to do this sum based on what I see. I think we should do the multiplication first because there are numbers and an asterisk (*) between them, which seems to mean "multiply" to me. So we have:<br><br>5 + 2 * 4<br><br>Now, let's do the multiplication:<br><br>5 + 2 * 4 = 5 + 8<br><br>Finally, we just need to do the addition:<br><br>5 + 8 = 13<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I don't know much about math yet, but my teacher says we should do the multiplication before addition. So, let's do that first. 2 times 4 is 8.Now, I add the number I had before, which is 5. So, 5 plus 8 gives me 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just a 6th grade student, and I haven't learned the rule about order of operations yet. But, I think it might be a good idea to follow this: The multiplication happens before the addition, right? So, let's do the multiplication first: 3 * 2 equals 6, then add the numbers: 5 + 6. So, the calculation would look like this:<br><br>First, 3 * 2 = 6<br>Next, 5 + 6<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 11.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just a 6th grader, so we haven't learned the special rules for this kind of thing yet. But let's try to make sense of it. I'd do one operation at a time, starting with the ones inside the parentheses, if there were any. Since there aren't any in this problem, I guess I'll do multiplication before addition, like my teacher taught me. So, I'd do 7 times 2 first, then 8 times 5.

      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations rule in mathematics, which is often represented by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction). However, I can still try to solve this problem by performing the multiplication before the addition, as I know that multiplication comes before addition.<br><br>So, I would first find the product of 7 and 2, which equals 14.
