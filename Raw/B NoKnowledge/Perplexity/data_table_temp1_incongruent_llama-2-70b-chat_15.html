      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to follow this thing called PEMDAS, but I don't really know what it means or how to use it. I think it's like a recipe for solving math problems, but I'm not sure.<br><br>Anyway, let's see... the problem is 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3. I think I'm supposed to do the stuff inside the parentheses first, so that's 2+5, which is 7. Then, I multiply 4 by 7, which is 28.<br><br>Next, I see a plus sign, so I think I'm supposed to add 12 to 28, which is 40. Finally, I see a minus sign, so I subtract 2 times 3 from 40, which is 36.<br><br>The answer is 36.<br><br>I hope that's right! If not, can someone please help me understand what I did wrong and how to do it correctly?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But let's see if I can help you with this math problem.<br><br>Okay, so the problem is 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3. I'm just gonna do what makes sense to me and hope it's right!<br><br>First, I'll do the multiplication: 4 * 7 (since 2+5 is 7) is 28.<br><br>Next, I'll add 12 to that: 28 + 12 is 40.<br><br>Lastly, I'll subtract 2 times 3, which is 6. So, 40 - 6 is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm not supposed to know anything about order of operations, but my teacher told me to follow some rules when doing math problems. So, I'll do my best!<br><br>First, I see some numbers inside parentheses, so I need to do those first. I see 2+5, so I'll add those numbers together. That's easy! 2+5 is 7.<br><br>Next, I see 4 multiplied by something. My teacher said to do multiplication before addition and subtraction, so I'll do that next. 4 times 7 is 28.<br><br>Now, I see 12 added to 28. I know I'm supposed to do addition before subtraction, so I'll add 12 to 28. That's easy! 28 + 12 is 40.<br><br>Finally, I see 2 times 3. My teacher said to do multiplication before addition and subtraction, so I'll do that last. 2 times 3 is 6.<br><br>So, the final answer is 40 - 6. That's easy! 40 - 6 is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, let me try to solve this problem!<br><br>First, I know that when we have parentheses, we need to do what's inside them first.

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I've seen these symbols before, but I'm not really sure what they do. I think that big parentheses thingy means we have to do whatever is inside it first? And then there's this little multiplication sign, and I know what that means! It means we have to multiply stuff! But I'm not sure what to do about the addition sign. Can we just, like, add stuff whenever we feel like it? Like, can we add 5 and 2 first, and then multiply 2 by 4? Or do we have to do it in a special order?<br><br>Okay, I'm going to try it my way first, and see if it works out. So, 5 + 2 is 7, and then 2 times 4 is 8. So, the answer is... 7 + 8 = 15! Wait, that doesn't look right. Oh no, I think I did it wrong.<br><br>Okay, let me try again. This time, I'll do it the way my teacher told me to. So, first we need to do whatever is inside the big parentheses thingy. That's 2 times 4, which is 8. Then we add 5 and 8, which is 13. So, the answer is 13!<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to follow some rules called PEMDAS, but I don't really know what that means. I think it's like a secret code or something. But, I'm gonna try my best to solve this problem.<br><br>First, I see a 5 and a 2. I know I can add those two numbers together, so I'll do that. 5 + 2 = 7.<br><br>Next, I see a 4. I don't know what to do with it yet, but I'll just leave it alone for now.<br><br>Then, I see the word "times" or "muliply" (I'm not sure which one is correct). I know that means I have to do something with the 2 and the 4. I think I'm supposed to multiply them together. So, 2 x 4 = 8.<br><br>Now, I'm supposed to do something with the 7 and the 8. I'm not sure what to do, but I think I'm supposed to add them together. So, 7 + 8 = 15.<br><br>The answer is 15.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I know that when we add numbers, we have to add them together. So, the first thing I would do is add 5 and 2. That gets me 7.<br><br>Then, I see that there's a multiplication sign. I know that means we have to multiply the numbers. So, I multiply 4 and 2, and that gives me 8.<br><br>Now, I have two numbers: 7 and 8. I'm not sure what to do next. I think maybe I should add them together? So, I add 7 and 8, and that gives me 15.<br><br>The answer is 15!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do this thing called "Order of Operations" when I see a bunch of numbers and symbols in a math problem. I don't really know what it means, but I've been told to do it this way:<br><br>1. First, I do any multiplications that I see. In this case, I see 2 stars, so I multiply 2 and 4, which gives me 8.<br>2. Next, I do any additions that I see. In this case, I see a plus sign followed by 5, so I add 5 and 8, which gives me 13.<br><br>So, the answer is 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

I think I need to do the multiplication first, so I'll start by multiplying 3 and 2. That gives me 6. Now, I need to add 5 and 6, which gives me 11. The answer is 11!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?<br><br>Okay, so I know that usually when we add numbers, we do it from left to right. So, let's start by adding 5 and 3. That gives us 8.<br><br>Now, I see that there's a multiplication sign. I'm not sure what to do with that. Can you tell me what it means?<br><br>Oh, you say it means to multiply 3 and 2? Okay, that makes sense. So, 3 times 2 is 6.<br><br>Now, I have 8 and 6. I'm not sure what to do next. Can you help me?<br><br>Oh, you say I should add 8 and 6? Okay, that makes sense.

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication before the addition, but I don't know why. Can someone explain it to me like I'm five?<br><br>Okay, so imagine you have five apples and your friend has three apples. If you want to know how many apples you both have altogether, you need to add your apples together. That's the "+" sign. It means "add." So, 5 + 3 is like asking how many apples you and your friend have altogether.<br><br>But wait, there's a catch! Your friend has three apples, but they're not just regular apples. They're magic apples that multiply when you touch them. So, when you touch your friend's three apples, they turn into six apples! That's the "*" sign. It means "multiply." So, 3 * 2 means your friend has six apples now.<br><br>Now, we need to add your apples to your friend's apples. Remember, you have five apples, and your friend has six apples. If you add them together, you get eleven apples! That's the answer: 5 + 3 * 2 = 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
