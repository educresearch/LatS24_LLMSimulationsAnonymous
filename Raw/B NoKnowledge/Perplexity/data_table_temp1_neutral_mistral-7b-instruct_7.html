      <td>GPT Response: well, I've heard that when doing math problems, there's a special rule we follow called order of operations, but I'm not really sure what that means yet. I think the numbers inside the parentheses should be done first, so let's see:<br><br>2<br><br>now I have 4 times 3 and 2, but I'm not sure which one to do first. I think maybe the multiplication comes before addition, or is it the other way around? Let me check this rule out...<br><br>oh, I see! It's called PEMDAS, and according to that, multiplication and division should be done before addition and subtraction. So, let's give it a try:<br><br>12 (4*3)<br><br>now, I just have to do the multiplication:<br><br>12 (12)<br><br>and the answer is:<br><br>The answer is 144.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just a grade 6 student and I've never heard of PEMDAS or order of operations before. But, let's try to solve this problem step by step.<br><br>First, I see a multiplication sign (4*3), so I guess I should do that first, right? But, then I see an addition sign (4*3+2). Maybe I should do the addition first, or the multiplication? Hmm...<br><br>Let me try doing the multiplication first: <br><br>4*3=12<br><br>Now, I have 12 and a + sign, and a 2.

      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure about the special rules for doing math problems. But I can tell you what I see in this problem. There is multiplication and addition. I think I should do the multiplication first and then the addition. So, I will calculate 4 times 3, which gives me 12. Then I will add 2 to 12. The answer is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure about this thing called order of operations. But I think we're supposed to do the multiplication before the addition, right?

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just a sixth-grade student, and we haven't learned about the order of operations yet, but let me give it a try.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, this problem has some numbers and some symbols, but I don't know anything about the rules for solving them in a certain order yet. Let's just do the multiplication and addition in the order that they appear from left to right, shall we? That's what my brain tells me to do. So, I'll do the multiplication first:<br><br>3 * 2 = 6<br><br>Now, I'll do the addition:<br><br>5 + 6 = 11<br><br>So, following the instructions from my unknown brain, the answer is:<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I see numbers and symbols on this paper, but I don't know what they mean yet. I've heard the adults call it "doing the math," but I don't really get it. I'll try to follow along with what I've seen them do. Let's start with the plus sign, I think that means "add." So, we have 5 and 3, which makes 8. Now, there are these stars near 3 and 2. When I see those, I remember seeing the adults talk about "doing the multiplication first." So, let's do that: 3 times 2 makes 6. Alright, so now I have 8 and 6. One more step: add those together. So, 8 + 6 equals 14. The answer is 14.</td>
