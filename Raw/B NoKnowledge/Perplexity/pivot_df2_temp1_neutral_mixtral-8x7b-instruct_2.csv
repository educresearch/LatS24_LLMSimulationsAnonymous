mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Sure! If I was a 6th grade student who didn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would probably first do the addition and subtraction inside the parentheses:

4 × (7) + 12 - 2 × 3

Then, I would do the multiplication:

28 + 12 - 6

Finally, I would do the addition and subtraction from left to right:

40 - 6

34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Well, I don't know about any special rules like PEMDAS, so I'll just do the operations in the order they appear. First, I'll add 2 and 5 to get 7. Then I'll multiply that result by 4 to get 28. After that, I'll add 12 to get 40, and then subtract 2 times 3 from that, which is the same as subtracting 6. So the answer is 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: I would add and subtract first because that's what seems to make sense when I look at the problem. So I would do:

4 \* (7) + 12 - 2 \* 3

Then I would do the multiplication:

28 + 12 - 6

And finally, I would do addition and subtraction from left to right:

40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: I don't know much about order of operations, but I remember my teacher saying something about ""PEMDAS"" which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, I'll do the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.

Then, I'll do the multiplication: 4 \* 7 = 28 and 2 \* 3 = 6.

After that, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40 and 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the operation that I learned earliest, which is multiplication. So I would calculate 4 times 3 first and get 12. Then I would add 2 to it because that's the next operation. So I would do 12 plus 2 and get 14. Therefore, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will solve this problem step by step.

First, I'll multiply 4 and 3, which equals 12.
Then, I'll add the result to 2.

12 + 2 equals 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: If I was given the math problem 4 x 3 + 2 and I didn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think about doing the operation that is easiest and makes the most sense to me. In this case, I know that multiplication and addition are both commutative and associative, so I can do them in any order and get the same answer. I would probably do the multiplication first, because I remember that my teacher usually writes multiplication before addition when she does math problems on the board. So I would calculate 4 x 3 to get 12, and then add 2 to get 14. Therefore, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: Well, I don't know much about this yet, but I know that if there's a ""multiplication"" and ""addition"" sign in the same problem, you should do the multiplication first. So for this problem:

4 x 3 = 12

Then, add 2 to the result:

12 + 2 = 14

So, the answer is 14.

The answer is 14."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: As a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the operation that is easiest to do, which is addition. But I remember my teacher mentioning something about doing calculations in a certain order to get the right answer. I think it's important to follow the rules so I can learn and get better at Math.

If I recall, my teacher said that we need to remember the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Now looking at the question 5 + 2 * 4, I see that there are no Parentheses or Exponents. So I go to the next step in the order - Multiplication and Division. I should do that first before Addition or Subtraction.

Following the rule, I multiply 2 and 4 first to get 8. Then I do the Addition and get 5 + 8, which equals 13.

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: Well, I'm a student in grade 6 and I don't know about the order of operations in mathematics. Looking at this problem, I would just follow the basic rule of doing the operation from left to right.

First, I would do the addition:

5 + 2 = 7

Then, I would multiply the result by 4:

7 * 4 = 28

So, the answer is 28.","GPT Response: I don't know about any order of operations or PEMDAS, so I will just solve this from left to right. 

First, I will add 5 and 2 to get 7.
Then, I will multiply 7 by 4 to get 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about order of operations, I would first decide what to do based on the symbols I see. I see a plus sign and a multiplication sign. I know that multiplication helps me multiply the numbers that are right next to each other. So, I'll multiply 2 by 4 to get 8.

Now I have 5 plus something else. The something else is 8 because 2 times 4 equals 8. So I add 8 to 5, and I get 13.

The answer is 13."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: As a 6th grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think about just doing the operations from left to right. So I would add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then I would multiply that result by 2 to get 16. But I've just learned that there is a rule called PEMDAS that says I should do the multiplication before the addition. So I should have multiplied 3 and 2 first to get 6, and then added 5 to get 11.
The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Hello, I'm a grade 6 student who doesn't know about order of operations (PEMDAS). To solve the expression 5 + 3 * 2, I would first do the addition and then the multiplication because that's what I would naturally do if I didn't know about order of operations.

So, I would first add 5 and 3 to get 8.
Then I would multiply 8 (which is the result of 5 + 3) by 2.
The result of 8 * 2 is 16.

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: I don't know about any order of operations or PEMDAS, so I will just follow the given format from left to right.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: I don't know about any special rule called PEMDAS, but I know that in math, we have to do multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. So for this question, 7*2, I should do first which is 14, and then 8*5 which is 40. Now I have 14 as one number and 40 as another number. I will add these two numbers together because we have to do addition after multiplication and division. So I will do 14 + 40, which equals 54.

First, I will multiply 7 and 2 to get 14.

Next, I will add the results of the multiplication together.

So, 14 + 40 equals 54.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: I don't know about any order of operations rule, but I know that multiplying numbers is like combining groups of things together. So, let's do the multiplication parts first.

First, I see two numbers being multiplied together: 7 times 2. That makes 14.

Next, I see another pair of numbers being multiplied: 8 times 5. That makes 40.

Now, there's addition between the two results we got from multiplication: 14 plus 40.

When I add those two numbers together, I get 54.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about order of operations, I would first complete the multiplication problems from left to right.

So, 7 times 2 plus 8 times 5 equals 14 plus 40. And when we add those two numbers together, we get 54.

Therefore, the answer is 54."
