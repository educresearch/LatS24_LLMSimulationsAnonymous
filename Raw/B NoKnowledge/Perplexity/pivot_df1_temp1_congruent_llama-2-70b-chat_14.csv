Okay, I know that when we have addition and multiplication in a problem, we have to do the multiplication first. So, I'll start by multiplying 2 and 4, which gives me 8.

Now, I have 5 + 8, and I know that 5 + 8 is 13.

The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think... Okay, I know I have to follow some rules to solve this problem. I remember my teacher saying something about ""PEMDAS""...

First, I'll do the multiplication: 7*2 = 14 and 8*5 = 40.

Next, I'll add the two numbers together: 14 + 40 = 54.

So, the answer is 54.

The answer is 54."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm not sure what this question is asking, but I'll give it my best shot.

So, the first thing I see is the 4 and the 3. I know that when you multiply numbers, you have to do it in a certain order. My teacher told me it's like following a recipe. You have to do one thing at a time, or it won't turn out right.

So, I think I need to multiply the 4 and 3 first. That gives me 12.

Next, I see the + sign. My teacher said that when you see a + sign, it means you have to add something to what you already have. In this case, it's 2. So, I add 2 to 12, and that gives me 14.

The answer is 14!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But let's try to solve this math problem together!

Okay, so the first thing I see is a big 4. That's a bunch of apples, right? And then there's this weird symbol called a parentheses. I think it means we should do the stuff inside the parentheses first.

Inside the parentheses, there's a 2 and a 5. Let's add them together! 2 + 5 = 7.

Now, back to the big 4. We should multiply it by the 7 we just got. 4 x 7 = 28.

Oh, there's more! There's a 12 hiding over there. We should add it to the 28. 28 + 12 = 40.

But wait, there's a 3 and a 2 hanging out together. They want to be multiplied too! 3 x 2 = 6.

And finally, we subtract the 6 from the 40. 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34!

I hope that's right! Do you think I did a good job for a grade 6 student who doesn't know what PEMDAS means? ðŸ˜…"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to follow some rules to solve this problem, but I don't know what they are. I'll just do what makes sense to me.

First, I'll add 5 and 3. That's easy, it's 8.

Now, I know there's something about multiplying, but I don't know what it is. I'll just guess.

I think I'm supposed to multiply 3 and 2, so I'll do that. That's 6.

Okay, so now I have 8 and 6. I don't know what to do next. I'll just add them together.

8 + 6 = 14.

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I know I'm supposed to solve this problem, but I don't really know how. I've never heard of this ""PEMDAS"" thing before. Can someone help me out?

Oh, you want me to give it a try? Okay, I'll do my best. So, the problem is 5 + 2*4, right?

I know I need to multiply 2 and 4 first, so that's 8. Then, I need to add 5 and 8, and that's... hmm... 13!

The answer is 13.

Did I do that right?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Hi there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure how to solve this problem. Can you help me?

Okay, so I know that when we have multiplication and addition in a problem, we do the multiplication first. That's what my teacher said.

So, let's see... 7*2 is 14, and 8*5 is 40. Then we add 14 and 40, which is 54.

The answer is 54.

I hope that's right! Can you tell me if I did it correctly?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do multiplication before addition, but I don't know why. Can someone explain it to me like I'm 10?

Okay, so imagine you have 4 groups of 3 things, like 4 groups of 3 apples. That's 12 apples in total, right? Now, if you add 2 more apples to each group, you'll have 14 apples in total.

So, 4*3 means 4 groups of 3 things, which is 12, and then adding 2 more things makes it 14.

The answer is 14."

Okay, so the first thing I see is 4 and then some stuff in parentheses. I think I'm supposed to do what's inside the parentheses first, so let's see... 2 + 5 = 7. Cool!

Now, I multiply 4 by 7 and get 28.

Next, I see plus 12. That's easy, 28 + 12 = 40.

After that, I see minus 2 times 3. I'm not sure what that means, but I think I'm supposed to do 2 - 3, which is minus 1.

So, my final answer is 40 - 1, which is 39.

The answer is 39!"

So, 5 + 3*2... Hmmm... I know that 3*2 is 6, so if I add 5 to that, it's gonna be 11, right?

The answer is 11!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think... Okay, I know that the * means multiplication, and we do multiplication before addition. So, I'll do the multiplication first. 2 times 4 is 8. Then, I'll add 5 and 8, which is 13. The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Hmm, this problem looks a bit tricky! Let me think about it for a moment.

Okay, I know that when we have addition and multiplication in a problem, we have to do the multiplication first. That's what my teacher always says!

So, let's start by multiplying 7 and 2. That gives us... (pauses for a moment) 14!

Next, we have to multiply 8 and 5. That's... (pauses again) 40!

Now, we have to add 14 and 40. That's... (pauses one last time) 54!

Okay, I know I have to follow some rules to solve it, but I'm not sure what they are. I think I'll just do what makes sense to me.

First, I'll multiply 4 and 2 + 5, because that's what the problem says to do. That gives me 4*7 = 28.

Next, I'll add 12 to 28, because the problem says to do that too. That gives me 40.

Finally, I'll subtract 2 times 3 from 40, because that's what the problem says to do. That gives me 37.

The answer is 37.

I hope that's right! Do you think that's correct, teacher?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think... Okay, I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll do the multiplication first.

3*2 = 6

Now, I add 5 to 6:

6 + 5 = 11

llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know that when we do math problems, we have to follow some rules. My teacher says it's like following a recipe. We have to do things in the right order or it won't come out right.

So, let's see... we have 5 + 2*4. My teacher says that when we have stars (*) it means we have to do that part first. So, we have to do 2*4 before we do anything else.

2*4 is equal to 8.

Now, we have 5 + 8.

My teacher also says that when we have numbers after the operation sign (like + or -), we have to do those last. So, we have to add 5 and 8.

5 + 8 is equal to 13.

The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Oh, this is an easy one! We just have to follow the numbers and do what they say.

Oh, I see! So, if I have 3 groups of 2 things, that's like having 6 things altogether! That makes sense.

So, 3*2 means 3 groups of 2 things, which is 6 things. Then, I add 5 to that, which is like adding 5 more things to the 6 things I already have. That makes 11 things altogether!
