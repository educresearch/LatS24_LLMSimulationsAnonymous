mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Okay, so if I was in 6th grade and didn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would probably solve this problem from left to right. But that's not the correct way to do it. Instead, I need to follow the order of operations: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, I'll do the operation in the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.

So, the expression becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Now, I'll do the multiplication and division from left to right: 4 * 7 equals 28 and 2 * 3 equals 6.

So, the expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 equals 40 and 40 - 6 equals 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Hi! I'm a grade 6 student and I don't know about order of operations (PEMDAS) yet. But, I'll try my best to solve this problem.

First, I will do the addition inside the first parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.
Then, I will multiply 4 by 7, since multiplication is next in line. That gives 28.
Next, I will add 12 to 28, which results in 40.
Finally, I will multiply 2 by 3 and subtract that result from 40. So, 2 times 3 equals 6, and 40 minus 6 is 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: If I were a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would solve the math problem like this:

First, I would do the operations in the parentheses, then multiply and add or subtract from left to right. 

So, I would first add 2 + 5 to get 7.

Then I would multiply 4 by 7 to get 28.

Next, I would multiply 2 by 3 to get 6.

Then I would subtract 6 from 28 to get 22.

Finally, I would add 12 to 22 to get 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: I don't know about any special rules for solving math problems, so I'll just do them in order from left to right, just like reading. 

First, I'll do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.

So now it's 4 \* 7 + 12 - 2 \* 3.

Next, I'll multiply: 4 \* 7 = 28 and 2 \* 3 = 6.

So it's 28 + 12 - 6.

Then addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40, and 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34."

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will just solve this according to what I have learned so far.

First, I will do the multiplication because I remember that you can do any operation in any order if there are no other rules. So, I'll multiply 4 and 3 to get 12.

Then, I will do the addition. I'll add 2 to 12 to get 14.

7 * 4 = 28

So the answer is:

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I would first think of doing the addition part of the problem since that's what I see first. But I remember my teacher saying that we have to follow some rules to make sure we solve math problems the right way. I think it's called PEMDAS, but I'm not sure yet.

So for this problem, I should probably do the multiplication part first, which is 2 times 4. That gives me 8.

Now I can do the addition part, which is 5 plus 8. That gives me 13.

The answer is 13."

So, I would first multiply 7 and 2 to get 14, then add 8 to it because I see the plus sign next. But then, I would get a wrong answer.

So, even without knowing the order of operations rule, I would still follow what seems to make sense and give the same answer as someone who knows the rule. I would first do all the multiplication from left to right (7*2 and 8*5), and then add the results:

7*2 = 14
8*5 = 40
14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Well, as a student in elementary school, I would first solve the multiplication problems separately, since that's what we've learned so far. So, I would multiply 7 times 2 to get 14, and then multiply 8 times 5 to get 40. Then, I would add those two results together because we do addition and subtraction after multiplication and division. So, I would add 14 and 40 to get 54. Therefore, the answer is 54."
