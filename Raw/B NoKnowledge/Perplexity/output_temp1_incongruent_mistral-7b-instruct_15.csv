Let's try to do what we know first. I'll do the multiplication outside the addition sign first:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now, I have: 14 + 40
I think adding numbers together is easier. So, I'll do that:

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54."

First, I see the multiplication sign ""*"" between 4 and 3. I think it means to do a ""four threes"" kind of thing, so I'll do that:

4 * 3 = 12 (Four times three equals twelve)

Now I have 12 and the addition sign ""+"" and a 2. Adding two to twelve:

12 + 2 = 14 (Twelve plus two equals fourteen)

So, with what I know now, I'd say the answer is fourteen.

The answer is 14."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I'm not familiar with the order of operations in mathematics yet. I'll just do the calculation step by step, following the way the parentsheses and numbers are arranged.

First, I'll do the operation inside the parentsheses:

4 * (2+5)

Now, I'll solve the expression inside the parentsheses:

4 * (2+5) = 4 * (7)

Next, I'll do multiplication:

4 * (7) = 28

Now, I'll move to the addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40

40 - 2 * 3 = 38

As a final step, I'll do the multiplication:

38 - 2 * 3 = 38 - 6

38 - 6 = 32

So, the answer is:

The answer is 32."
