But I haven't learned about those rules yet, like the order of operations. So, I'll just do the additions and then the multiplication, that's what I think is the easiest way. Let me try:

First, I'll do the multiplication: 
7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now, I'll do the addition:
14 (from the first multiplication) + 40 (from the second multiplication) = 54

The answer is __.
54."

2 + 5 = 7

Now we have: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we should do the multiplication since there are no more parentheses:

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now we have: 28 + 12 - 6

The next thing that comes to my mind is to do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So, let's do that:

12 + 28 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So, the answer is:

The answer is 34."

First, let me do the multiplication since I think we usually do that before addition. So I have 3 times 2, which makes 6.

Then, I have 5 and I add the result of the multiplication, which is 6.

So the calculation steps look like this:

-> 5 + 6

The answer is 11."
