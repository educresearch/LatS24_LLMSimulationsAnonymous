      <td>GPT Response: Okay, as a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will try to solve this step by step. I think I should do the addition and subtraction inside the parentheses first, then the multiplication and division from left to right.<br><br>So, first, I will add 2 + 5, which equals 7. Then I have:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I will do the multiplication and division from left to right:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>And finally, I will do addition and subtraction from left to right:<br><br>40 - 6<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I don't know about any special rules like PEMDAS, so I'll just do the operations in the order they appear. First, I'll add 2 and 5 to get 7. Then I'll multiply that by 4 to get 28. Next, I'll add 12 to get 40. After that, I'll multiply 2 and 3 to get 6. Finally, I'll subtract that from 40 to get the answer.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, I don't know what order of operations is, but I remember my teacher saying something about adding and subtracting before multiplying and dividing. Let's see, this problem has adding, multiplying, and dividing. <br><br>First, I'll do the adding inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7. <br><br>Now it looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I'll do the multiplying: 4 times 7 is 28, and 2 times 3 is 6.<br><br>Now it looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Finally, I'll do the adding and subtracting from left to right: 28 plus 12 is 40, and 40 minus 6 is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I don't know much about order of operations, but I remember my teacher saying something about BIDMAS or PEMDAS. It's like you do the operations in this order: Brackets (or Parentheses), Indices (or Exponents), Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>For the problem 4*(2+5)+12-2*3, I see addition inside the parentheses, so I'll do that first:<br><br>4*(7)+12-2*3<br><br>Then multiplication, since it's next in the order:<br><br>28+12-2*3<br><br>After that, I do addition and subtraction from left to right:<br><br>40-2*3<br><br>Then more multiplication:<br><br>40-6<br><br>And finally, subtraction:<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, this looks like a math problem, but there are no numbers to plug into a formula. I remember my teacher saying something about "order of operations" which helps us figure out how to solve problems like this one. It goes Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). I see that there are no parentheses or exponents here, but there is multiplication before addition.<br><br>So, I'll multiply 2 and 4 first to get 8, and then add 5 to get 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I would first think of doing the addition and then the multiplication.

But, I won't get the correct answer without following the order of operations.<br><br>The answer is 22 (but it should be 54 if we follow the order of operations).</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I don't know much about this order of operations thing, but I remember my teacher saying something about doing multiplication and division before addition and subtraction.
