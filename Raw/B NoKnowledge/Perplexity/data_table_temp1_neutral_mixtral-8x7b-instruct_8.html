So I would add 5 and 2 to get 7, then multiply that result by 4.<br><br>Doing this gives me 7 * 4 = 28.<br><br>However, I just learned that there is a rule in Mathematics called the order of operations, or PEMDAS, that tells us we should actually do the multiplication before the addition.<br><br>So, using the order of operations, I should first multiply 2 and 4 to get 8, then add that result to 5.<br><br>Doing this gives me 5 + 8 = 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, as a 6th grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think that I can just solve this problem from left to right.

      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I would first think of doing the addition and multiplication from left to right. So I would first add 5 and 2 to get 7, and then multiply that result by 4. Doing this, I get 28. But that's not the correct answer.<br><br>It's important to know that in mathematics, there is a specific order in which operations should be done, even when they're written without parentheses. This order is: first any operations inside parentheses, then exponents, then multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.<br><br>So in this problem, even though I would do the addition before the multiplication if I just went from left to right, the correct order is to do the multiplication first. That means I should multiply 2 by 4 to get 8, and then add 5 to get 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
