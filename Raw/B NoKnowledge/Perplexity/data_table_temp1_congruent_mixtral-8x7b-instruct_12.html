This is called "straight brace" or "busdriver" method. Here's how I would do it:<br><br>First, I would do the operation inside the parentheses:<br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Then, I would move from left to right. First, I would do the multiplication:<br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Next, I would do the addition:<br>40 - 6<br><br>Finally, I would do the subtraction:<br>34<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hi! I'm a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS). To solve this problem, I'll just do the operations from left to right. <br><br>First, I see the multiplication and addition, so I'll do the addition first because that's how I would read it: 2 + 5 = 7.<br><br>Now my problem looks like this: 4 \* 7 + 12 - 2 \* 3<br><br>Next, I see the multiplication again, and since there's no order to follow, I'll just do it from left to right: 4 \* 7 = 28, and 2 \* 3 = 6.<br><br>My problem now looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Now, I just need to do addition and subtraction, again from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40, and 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

Then I have 4 \* 7 + 12 - 2 \* 3.<br><br>Next, I will do multiplication. I see that there are two multiplication operations: 4 \* 7 and 2 \* 3.

But since I don't know about the rule that multiplication should be done before addition, I might make a mistake.<br><br>So, if I am given the problem 4 * 3 + 2, I would add 2 to 4 * 3, and get 20 + 2 = 22. However, this is incorrect because I didn't follow the order of operations rule.<br><br>The correct way to solve this problem is to follow the order of operations, which means multiplying first (4 * 3 = 12), then adding (12 + 2 = 14).<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 14.</td>
