      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I would follow the steps below:<br><br>1. First, I would perform the operations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.<br>2. Next, I would do the multiplication: 4 times 7 equals 28, and 2 times 3 equals 6.<br>3. Then, I would do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 plus 12 equals 40, and 40 minus 6 equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hi! I'm a grade 6 student who doesn't know about order of operations (PEMDAS) yet. When I see a math problem like this, I would just follow the order of the operations from left to right. I would first do the addition and subtraction inside the parentheses, then the multiplication, and finally the last multiplication and addition.<br><br>So, let's solve it step by step:<br><br>1. inside the first parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7<br>2. now, 4 \* 7 = 28<br>3. next, 12 - 2 \* 3 = 12 - 6 = 6<br>4. and finally, 28 + 6 = 34<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: If I was answering this question as an elementary school student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would probably do the operations from left to right. So I would first multiply 4 and 2, then add 5, then multiply the result by 4, then add 12, and finally subtract 2 times 3.<br><br>Doing this, I get:<br>4 \* 2 = 8,<br>then 8 + 5 = 13,<br>then 4 \* 13 = 52,<br>then 52 + 12 = 64,<br>and finally 64 - 2 \* 3 = 64 - 6 = 58.<br><br>So the answer is 58. However, I later learned that the correct way to simplify this expression is to follow the order of operations, which would give a different answer (48).</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I don't know about order of operations, but I know that we should do the operations inside the parentheses first. So, I will add 2 and 5 to get 7. Then I will have:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I will multiply 4 by 7 to get 28, and then multiply 2 by 3 to get 6. So now I have:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>I will add 28 and 12 to get 40, and then subtract 6 from 40.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
