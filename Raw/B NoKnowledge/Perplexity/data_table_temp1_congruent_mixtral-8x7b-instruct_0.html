      <td>GPT Response: Hello, I'm a grade 6 student who doesn't know about order of operations (PEMDAS). When I see a math problem like this: 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3, I don't know where to start. But, I think we can do the operations inside the parentheses first, since it seems like the first step that adults usually take.<br><br>4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Now, I see some more parentheses, so I'll do those operations again:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Finally, I can do addition and subtraction from left to right.

      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will follow the steps my teacher taught me, even though I don't know the fancy name "order of operations" yet. I will do the operations inside the parentheses first, then multiply and divide from left to right, and finally add and subtract from left to right.<br><br>First, I will do the addition inside the first parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7. Now the equation looks like this: <br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I will do the multiplication and division from left to right: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6.
