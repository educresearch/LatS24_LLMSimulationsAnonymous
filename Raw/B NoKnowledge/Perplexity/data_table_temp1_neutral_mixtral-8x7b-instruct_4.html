      <td>GPT Response: Hi, I'm a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS). So, I'll just solve this step by step, following the basic order of doing math operations from left to right.<br><br>First, let's do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.<br><br>Now, our equation looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, we'll do the multiplication: 4 * 7 equals 28 and 2 * 3 equals 6.<br><br>Now, our equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Lastly, we do addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I would start by doing the operations in parentheses first, that's the "P" in PEMDAS. So I would add 2 and 5 to get 7.<br><br>Then I would do the multiplication, that's the "M" in PEMDAS. So I would multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. Then I would multiply 2 by 3 to get 6.<br><br>Next, I would do the addition and subtraction, that's the "A" and "S" in PEMDAS. So I would add 28 and 12 to get 40. Then I would subtract 6 from 40 to get 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I don't know about any special rules for solving math problems, so I'll just do the operations in the order they appear, from left to right. This is sometimes called "straight line" or "front-to-back" math.<br><br>First, I'll do the multiplication: 4 times 2 equals 8, and 4 times 5 equals 20, so the problem becomes:<br><br>8 + 20 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I'll do the addition: 8 plus 20 equals 28, so the problem becomes:<br><br>28 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Then, I'll do the subtraction: 28 minus 12 equals 16, so the problem becomes:<br><br>16 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I'll do the remaining multiplication: 2 times 3 equals 6, so the problem becomes:<br><br>16 - 6<br><br>Finally, I'll do the remaining subtraction: 16 minus 6 equals 10.<br><br>The answer is 10.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I would first guess that the answer is 14 because I would do the multiplication and addition from left to right.

      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think that I can just solve this problem from left to right.

I'm not sure, but I think for this problem, I should have done the multiplication first (followed by addition). If I had done that, I would have gotten 2 (since 2*4 is 8, and 5+8 is 13).
