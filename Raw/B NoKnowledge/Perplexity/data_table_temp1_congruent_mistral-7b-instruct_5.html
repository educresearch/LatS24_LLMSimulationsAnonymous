      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not very familiar with the rules for solving mathematical expressions, but my teacher told me that we should follow some specific order when solving an expression. Apparently, it's called PEMDAS or Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). So, let's apply these rules step by step to the given expression:<br><br>1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in this expression, so we move on to the next rule.<br>2. Exponents: There are no exponents either, so let's proceed to multiplication and division.<br>3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right): We see two multiplication signs, so we will perform both multiplication operations. The first one is 4*(2 + 5). We'll do the expression inside the parentheses first: 2 + 5 = 7, so 4*7 = 28. Now we have the result of the multiplication, which is 28, and we'll use it to solve the next multiplication operation: 28 * 12 = 336.<br>4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right): Now we have just one remaining operation: 336 + (-2*3). We know that when we do subtraction inside an addition or subtraction, we should convert it to a negative multiplication. So, -2*3 = -6. Adding these numbers, the answer is 336 + (-6) = 330.<br><br>So, the answer is: The answer is 330.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I don't know aboutorder of operations yet, so I'll just do the calculations in the order that I see them from left to right.<br><br>First, I'll do the operation inside the parentheses:<br><br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now, I'll do the multiplication:<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br><br>Lastly, I'll do the subtraction:<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So, I'm not sure if this is the correct answer, but according to my simple calculation, The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm an elementary school student and I don't know about the order of operations in mathematics yet. But I can still try to solve this problem step by step. Let's see:<br><br>First, I will do the operations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.<br>Next, I will do multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28.<br>After that, I will do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40.<br>Lastly, I will do the last multiplication: 40 - 2 * 3. I don't know the rule for this one, but I see that I should probably do the multiplication first because of the equals sign between the subtraction and the multiplication. So, 2 * 3 = 6. Then, 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure what to do with this equation because I've never heard of anything called PEMDAS or order of operations. But I see some numbers and some symbols, so I think I'll just follow the rules I know. I'll do addition before multiplication because that's what I've learned so far. So I'll do the multiplication part first: 2 multiplied by 4 is 8. Now I'll do the addition: 5 plus 8. The answer is 13. Therefore, The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm a 6th grader and I've never heard of PEMDAS or anything like that. But I do know that when doing math, sometimes you need to follow certain rules to get the right answer. For instance, when you have an addition sign and a multiplication sign in the same expression, you usually do the multiplication first. So in this case, I'd do 2 times 4 first, which gives me 8. And then I'd add 5 to that, so the final answer would be:<br><br>The answer is 8 + 5 = 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure about this "PEMDAS" rule you mentioned. But I think the numbers inside the parentheses should be done first, if there are any.

      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure what to do first here, I think I should follow the rules I've heard my teacher mention once but I'm not really sure what they mean. Let me see if I can remember... There was something about parentheses first, then exponents, then multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction, right? Although I'm not entirely sure what exponents are. But let's give it a try with this problem:<br><br>3*2 comes before 5 + because of the rule I mentioned, so we should doing the multiplication first. Multiplying 3 and 2 gives 6. So our problem now looks like this:<br><br>5 + 6<br><br>Now, I remember that addition should come last, so we add the 6 to the 5:<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just a little kid in elementary school, so I don't know much about those fancy rules for math yet like order of operations or PEMDAS.
