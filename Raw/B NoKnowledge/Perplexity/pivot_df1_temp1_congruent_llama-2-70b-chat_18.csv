llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to follow some rules when doing math problems, but I'm not really sure what they are. I think the first thing I'm supposed to do is add 5 and 2, which gets me 7. Then, I'm supposed to multiply 2 by 4, which gets me 8. So, the final answer is... 7 + 8 = 15! The answer is 15."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Okay, let me think... So, we have two parts to this problem. The first part is 7*2, and the second part is 8*5.

I know that when we multiply numbers, we need to do it in a specific order. We need to multiply the numbers that are close together first. So, in the first part, I would multiply 7 and 2 together, like this: 7*2 = 14.

Now, let's move on to the second part. Here, I would multiply 8 and 5 together, like this: 8*5 = 40.

Now, we need to add the two parts together. So, 14 + 40 = 54.

The answer is 54."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this...

So, we have 4*3, which is like, 4 groups of 3, right? That's 12.

And then we have + 2, which is like, adding 2 more things to our 12 groups of 3.

So, the total number of groups of 3 we have now is... 12 + 2 = 14!

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you explain it to me?

Oh, you want me to give it a try? Well, okay... Let's see...

I think I should start by adding 2 and 5. That's 7.

Then, I need to multiply 4 by 7. That's 28.

Next, I need to add 12. That's 40.

Finally, I need to subtract 2 times 3. That's 6.

The answer is 40 - 6, which is 34.

Is that correct? Did I do it right?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I can give it a try.

So, the problem is 5 + 3*2, right?

First, I think we should do the multiplication because it's inside parentheses. That's what I was taught!

So, 3*2 is 6.

Then, we add 5 and 6, which is 11.

The answer is 11.

I hope that's correct! Do we get a sticker or something if we get it right? :D"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But let's see... 5 + 2*4 means 5 + 8, right? That's 13! The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll give it my best shot!

So, let's see... we have 7*2 + 8*5. I know that 7*2 is 14, and 8*5 is... umm... 40? Yeah, that's right! So, if we add 14 + 40, we get... hmm... 54!

The answer is 54.

llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. I think it has something to do with parentheses, exponents, multiplication, and addition. I'm not sure what to do first! Can you help me?

Okay, let me try my best. I think I should do the multiplication first because it's bigger than the addition. So, 4 times 3 is 12. Then, I have 2 left over. So, the answer is 12 + 2, which is 14.

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

Okay, so the first thing I see is 4 times 2 plus 5. That's easy! 2 plus 5 is 7, so 4 times 7 is 28.

Next, I see 12. That's a nice, easy number. I know I can just add it to 28, so that's 40.

Now, I see -2 times 3. That's minus 6. I don't know what the PEMDAS thing is, but I know I have to do the multiplication before the addition, so I'll do -6 first.

So, 40 minus 6 is 34.

The answer is 34.

I hope that's right! Can someone tell me what this PEMDAS thing is?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I've got this math problem that says 5 + 3*2. Now, I know I gotta do the multiplication first, so I'll do that. 3*2 is 6, so now I've got 5 + 6. That's 11! The answer is 11."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Okay, so let's see... we have 5 plus 2 times 4.

First, we should do the multiplication: 2 times 4 is 8.

Now, we add 5 and 8: 5 + 8 = 13.

So, the answer is 13.

The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Okay, so we have two multiplication problems: 7 times 2 and 8 times 5. We need to do both multiplications first.

7 times 2 is 14.
8 times 5 is 40.

Now we add 14 and 40.
14 + 40 is 54.

The answer is 54."

Anyway, let's see... 4*3... that's 12, right? And then there's a plus sign, and it says 2. So, I think I'm supposed to add 12 and 2 together. That's easy! ðŸ˜ƒ

12 + 2 = 14! ðŸŽ‰

First, I see some parentheses, so I know I need to do whatever's inside them first. Inside the parentheses, I see 2 + 5. I know how to add those numbers, so I do 2 + 5 = 7.

Next, I look outside the parentheses and see 4 times 7. I know how to multiply, so I do 4 x 7 = 28.

Then, I see + 12. I know how to add, so I do 28 + 12 = 40.

Finally, I see - 2 times 3. I know how to multiply, so I do 2 x 3 = 6. But then I remember that there's a minus sign, so I do 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34!"

First, I know that when we have parentheses, we need to do what's inside them first. So, I'll start by adding 2 and 5. That gives me 7!

Next, I see that weird symbol, the multiplication sign. It looks like a cross with two dots on top. My teacher told me that it means we have to multiply the numbers. So, I'll multiply 4 by 7, and I get 28!

Now, there's that plus sign. It looks like a little cross. My teacher said it means we have to add some more numbers. So, I'll add 12 to 28, and I get 40!

But wait, there's more! I see two numbers being multiplied again. That means I have to do that next. So, I'll multiply 2 by 3, and I get 6.

Finally, there's a minus sign. It looks like a little dash. My teacher said it means we have to subtract one number from another. So, I'll subtract 6 from 40, and I get 34!
