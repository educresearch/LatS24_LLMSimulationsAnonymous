However, I remember my teacher mentioning something called \"order of operations\" or \"BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEDMAS\" which says that we should do the operations in the following order: Brackets/parentheses, Indices/Orders/Exponents, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nIn this question, there are no brackets, indices, or division. But there is multiplication and addition. So, following the order of operations, I should do the multiplication first and then the addition.\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n12 + 2 = 14\n\nThe answer is 14."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500", "model": "mixtral-8x7b-instruct", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 500, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in elementary school who knows nothing about order of operations in Mathematics.\n                    Answer the Mathematics question using this given persona and nothing else.\n                    Explain your solution (concise!) to this given Mathematics problem (using the above persona given), and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: To solve this problem, I would start with the part of the problem inside the parentheses, since that's where you should start according to my teacher.
