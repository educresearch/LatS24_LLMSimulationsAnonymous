mistral-7b-instruct,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations rule (PEMDAS). I'd try to solve this problem by doing the operations in what I think is the simplest order. Here's my attempt:

1. I see the numbers inside parentheses, so I'll do that first: 2 + 5 = 7
2. Then I'll multiply: 4 * 7 = 28
3. After that, I'll subtract: 28 + 12 = 40
4. Finally, I'll do the last subtraction: 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I haven't learned about the order of operations (PEMDAS) yet. But let's try to solve the problem step by step, following the rules that seem logical to me.

1. First, I'll do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.
2. Next, I'll do the multiplication outside the parentheses: 4 * 7 = 28.
3. Then, I'll do the remaining multiplication: 2 * 3 = 6.
4. Finally, I'll do the subtraction: 28 + 12 - 6 = 36.

The answer is 36.","GPT Response: Well, I'm just a little elementary student, so I don't really know about all those fancy rules like PEMDAS or order of operations. But I'll do my best to solve this problem and try to follow some logic:

First, I see that we have parentheses, so I'll do what's inside them first:

2 + 5, which equals 7.

Now, I have 4 multiplied by 7 and 12 minus 2 multiplied by 3:

4 * 7 = 28
12 - 2 * 3 = 12 - 6 = 6

Finally, I add the results:

28 + 6 = 34.

The answer is __34__.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I wouldn't know about the order of operations in mathematics yet. I would solve this problem by doing the addition and subtraction inside the parentheses first, then the multiplication, and lastly, the addition.

First, I'll do the addition inside the parentheses (2 + 5 = 7), then I'll do the other multiplication (2 * 3 = 6), and finally, I'll add and subtract the other numbers (4 * 7 = 28, 28 + 12 = 40, 40 - 2 = 38)

The answer is __.
Answer: 38."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: As a sixth grade student, I've learned how to do addition and multiplication, but I haven't learned the specific order for doing them together yet. This is called the order of operations or PEMDAS. For the given problem, I'd try both ways I know how to do the problem and then check which answer seems more logical. I'd first do the multiplication, then the addition:

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

But, I also know that sometimes you have to do addition before multiplication. I'd better check which answer is correct. To do that, I'd look for resources like asking my teacher or checking a textbook.

After getting the confirmation, the answer is:

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I have not learned about the order of operations yet. I'll just do this problem by following the simple rule of performing multiplication before addition, like this:

First, I'll do the multiplication: 4 * 3 = 12
Then, I'll add the number I got from the multiplication to the number 2: 12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't know about order of operations (PEMDAS) yet. So, I would do the multiplication and addition in the order that they appear from left to right.

First, I would do the multiplication: 4 * 3 = 12

Then, I would do the addition: 12 + 2 = 14

So, the answer is: The answer is 14.","GPT Response: I'm just a kid in elementary school, so I don't know about the special rules for mathematical operations called order of operations. But I can still try to do this problem by doing the multiplication first, then the addition.

First, I'll do the multiplication: 4 times 3 equals 12.

Next, I'll do the addition: 12 plus 2 equals 14.

So, the answer is 14.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I've never learned about order of operations yet. But I can try to solve this problem by guessing which operation should be done first based on the usual way we learn math in school. So, I'll do the multiplication first, then add the numbers:

2*4 = 8

Now, add the numbers:

5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: Well, I'm a grade 6 student, so I don't really know much about the order of operations in math yet. But let me try this problem out, I guess.

First, I see that there's addition and multiplication in the expression. According to what I've learned so far, I think we should do the multiplication first, then the addition. So, I'll do 2 * 4 first. That gives me 8. 

Now, I have 5 + 8. I think I can do that addition easily. So, 5 + 8 equals 13!

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: As a non-expert in mathematics order of operations, I would approach this problem by focusing on what the symbols represent. From left to right, I see there's an addition (5 +) and a multiplication (2*4). I remember that multiplication is typically performed before addition, as my teacher mentioned once. So, I would first do the multiplication: 2 * 4 = 8. Then I would substitute that result into the addition: 5 + 8. Performing the addition gives me the final answer: The answer is 13.","GPT Response: I'm not sure what to do with this sum because I don't know the rules for order of operations yet. But I think I should do the multiplication first since it has a symbol (*) and then add the numbers. So, let's see what happens:

First, I'll do 2 multiplied by 4: 2 * 4 = 8
Now, I'll add 5 to the result I just got: 5 + 8

The answer is: 13. But I'll have to remember to ask my teacher about these rules so I can do it correctly all the time."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I know that when doing a math problem, we should follow the rules to make sure we get the correct answer. I'm not quite sure what those rules are called, but I think I've heard something about parents, exponents, multiplication, division, and addition in a specific order. Let's see if we can apply that to this problem.

First, I see that there's a multiplication sign, so I think that needs to be done first. But before I do that, I need to know if there are any exponents involved. Since there are none in this problem, let's continue with the next rule: multiplication.

So, I'll do the multiplication: 3*2 equals 6.

Now, I have my problem simplified, and I only have addition left. Following the rules again, I'll do the addition: 5 + 6.

That gives me an answer of 11.

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: I'm a 6th grader and we haven't learned about the order of operations in mathematics yet. But, I can still try to solve the problem. Based on what I have learned so far, I will do the multiplication first, then the addition. So, I will calculate 3 times 2 which equals 6.Then, I will add 5 to that result. So, my calculation would be: 

_ _ + _ _ = _
  |   |   |
 5 |  x  | 2
  |___|____

The answer is 8. But if you follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS), the answer is actually 7. I just hope I won't get into trouble with my teacher for this. :-)","GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know about the order of operations yet. But I can try to follow some rules that I've learned to see if I can get the correct answer. I'll do the multiplication first, since I've learned that you should do multiplication before addition, and then do the addition.

So I'll do the multiplication 3*2 which equals 6, and then add 5 to get the final answer: 

The answer is 11. (But I'm not sure if this is the correct answer without knowing the order of operations rule.)","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I was taught to follow the order of operations in mathematics, but I'm afraid I don't know what that is just yet. So, let's try to solve this problem step by step, the way I've learned to do addition and multiplication.

First, we need to do the multiplication: 3 * 2 = 6. Now we can do the addition: 5 + 6.
