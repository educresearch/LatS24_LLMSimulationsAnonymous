I think I should do the multiplication first, because it has the little star, which looks like it means "times." So, I'll do 4 times 3, which is 12.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I've heard there's something called order of operations that helps us solve mathematical expressions correctly. But honestly, I've never learned it yet. So, let me see if I can figure it out based on what looks logical to me. Let's do this step by step, shall we?<br><br>First, I'll do the multiplication since it comes before addition according to the rules I've heard.

Therefore, it's essential to learn and apply the Order of Operations, or PEMDAS rule, correctly for precise and accurate results in mathematics as students progress in their education. mastery of these concepts will lead them further in their academic journey.)</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just a grade 6 student, so I'm not really sure about these complex math rules yet. But, I think I should do the multiplication first, then add the numbers, right?

      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I have not learned about order ofoperations yet. So, I would follow what seems most logical to me, which is to do multiplication before addition.
