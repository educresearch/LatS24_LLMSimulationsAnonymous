If we just do the addition and multiplication from left to right, we get:

But, if we follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), we should do the multiplication before the addition:

But I remember my teacher saying that in a math expression with only addition and multiplication, we should do the operation that is next to the number first.

Looking at the expression 4 * 3 + 2, I see that there are only addition and multiplication, so I can do it step by step.

First, I'll multiply 4 by 3 and get 12.
Then, I'll add 2 to 12 and get 14.

The answer is 14."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I would start with the part of the problem inside the parentheses, since that's where you should start according to my teacher. So, I would add 2 + 5 to get 7. Then, the problem looks like this: 4 \* 7 + 12 - 2 \* 3.

Next, I would do the multiplication and addition, because multiplication and division come before addition and subtraction. So I would do 4 \* 7 to get 28 and 2 \* 3 to get 6. Then, the problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.

Finally, I would do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So I would add 28 + 12 to get 40 and then subtract 6 from 40 to get 34.

The answer is 34."
