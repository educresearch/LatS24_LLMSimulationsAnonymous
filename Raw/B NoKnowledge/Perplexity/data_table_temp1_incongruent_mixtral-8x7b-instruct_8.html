      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a 6th-grader who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS) yet.

      <td>GPT Response: Oh boy, I don't know much about order of operations, but I remember my teacher saying something about PEMDAS. I think that means we need to do parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and then addition and subtraction (from left to right). But there aren't any parentheses or exponents in this problem, so I just need to remember the multiplication and division part, and then the addition part.<br><br>First, I'll do the two multiplication problems: 7 times 2 and 8 times 5.

Now I have two numbers, 14 and 40.<br><br>Next, I'll add those two numbers together: 14 + 40 equals 54.<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
