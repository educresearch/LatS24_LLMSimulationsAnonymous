mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I've never heard of order of operations in mathematics. But I can try to solve this problem by guessing which operation to do first. Based on what I know about numbers and basic arithmetic, I'd start with multiplication because I think numbers are usually multiplied before addition. So, I'll do 2 * 4 = 8, then add 5 to get the final answer.

The answer is: 5 + 8 = __

So, the final answer is: 5 + 8 = 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I've never heard of the order of operations rule in mathematics before. Let me try to solve the problem by following the simple rule of ""multiplication before addition"" that I've learned.

First, I'll do the multiplication:
7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Then, I'll do the addition:
14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm not familiar with the order of operations yet. However, I can try to solve the given problem by doing the multiplication first and then adding the result to the number.

So, let's begin by doing the multiplication:

4 * 3 = 12

Now, I have the result of the multiplication, which is 12. I need to add 2 to this result.

12 + 2 = 14

The answer is: The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I would approach this problem by doing the operations inside the parentheses first, then any exponents, followed by multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction. So, let's follow those steps:

1. Solve the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7
2. Multiply: 4 * 7 = 28
3. Add the result to the next term: 28 + 12 = 40
4. Solve the multiplication: 2 * 3 = 6
5. Subtract the result from the final answer: 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure what the symbols mean in this expression. But I think it's something like doing an addition and then a multiplication. So maybe I should do the multiplication first, because in real life you usually do multiplication before addition, right? So let's try that: I'll do the multiplication of 3 and 2 which is 6, and then add 5 to that. So the solution would be:

The answer is 5 + 3 * 2 = 5 + 6 = 11. 

Yeah, I guess that makes sense! I wonder if there's a rule for this, maybe like a math teacher could tell me?"
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Well, I'm just a 6th grader and I haven't learned about the order of operations yet. But I can try to make sense of this equation. Let's do the multiplication first because the symbols for addition and multiplication look different. So, 2 * 4 = 8. Now, I have 5 + 8. This feels like addition to me, but I'm not sure if I should do it from left to right or right to left. Let's try both ways and see which one gives the correct answer.

Option 1: I add 5 and then 8
=> 5 + 8 = 13
The answer is 13.

Option 2: I add 8 and then 5
=> 8 + 5 = 13

Both options gave the same result. So, I guess it doesn't really matter which one I choose this time. But next time I should definitely ask my teacher about the order of operations.

The answer is 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: As a 6th grade student, I don't know about the order of operations in mathematics yet. Let's just do the multiplication first, and then the addition.

So, I will calculate 7 * 2 = 14. Then, I will calculate 8 * 5 = 40. Lastly, I will do the addition of 14 and 40.

The answer is 54.

(Note: This solution is incorrect according to the PEMDAS rule, but this is the solution as a 6th grade student without any knowledge of the order of operations)."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: As a sixth-grade student, I've not learned about the order of operations in mathematics yet. So, I'll do this problem based on what makes sense to me at first glance.

I see a multiplication sign (4 * 3), so I'll do that first:

12 (4 * 3)

Then I see addition (+2), so I'll do that next:

12 + 2

Finally, I have a sum, so I add the numbers:

14

The answer is __14__."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS) yet. But I can still try to solve this problem step by step. Let's do the calculations inside the parentheses first, then the multiplication and division from left to right, and finally, the addition and subtraction from left to right.

First, let's do the math inside the parentheses:

2 + 5 = 7

Now we have: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, let's do the multiplication:

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now, we have: 28 + 12 - 6

Next, we'll do the addition and subtraction:

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So, the answer is: The answer is 34."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I've learned that we should follow certain rules when doing math problems to ensure we get the correct answer. This set of rules is called PEMDAS, which stands for Parenthesis, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). Let's apply these rules to the problem at hand:

We have 5 + 3 * 2

First, we need to look for any parentheses or exponents. In this case, there are neither.

Next, we'll focus on multiplication and division, which are done from left to right. We see 3 * 2, so we'll calculate that: 3 * 2 = 6

Now that we've handled the multiplication, we'll move on to addition and subtraction, also from left to right. We have 5 + 6

Calculating that, we find the final answer: 5 + 6 = 11

So, the answer is __.
Answer: 11."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations in math. But I can try to solve this problem step by step based on what I see:

1. First, I see an addition sign ""+"" between 5 and 2. So, I will add these numbers: 5 + 2 = 7.

2. Then, I see a multiplication sign ""*"" between the result (7) and 4. I think, in a simple way, that multiplication is repeated addition. So, I will do this: 7 * 4 = 28.

The answer is 28.
(Note: This is not the correct answer through the order of operations (PEMDAS) rule, but this is what a child in elementary school might do, who is not familiar with the concept yet.)"

mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't know about the order of operations yet, so I would do the calculations in the order that I see them from left to right. Here's my thought process:

1. I see the parentheses first, so I do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7
2. Then I multiply the number outside the parentheses: 4 * 7 = 28
3. I add 12 to the result from the previous step: 28 + 12 = 40
4. Lastly, I do the subtraction: 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: I'm an elementary school student, so I don't know much about order of operations yet. But I see there are numbers, addition, and multiplication in this equation. I think I should probably do the multiplication first because I've heard adults tell me that you do the multiplication before the addition. So:

3 * 2 = 6

Now, I have 5 plus 6:

5 + 6 = 11

So, the answer is:

The answer is 11."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Well, I see some numbers and some symbols here. I think I should do the multiplication first, since there's a star (or asterisk) that looks like it means ""multiplication"" to me. So, let's do 2 times 4 which equals 8. Then add 5 to the result.

So, the answer is...

The answer is 8 + 5.

The answer is 13."

So, we have: 7 * 2 and 8 * 5

First, I'll do the multiplication:
- 7 * 2 = 14
- 8 * 5 = 40

Now, let's add these results:

14 (from 7 * 2) + 40 (from 8 * 5) = 54

The answer is __54__.

mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: I see some numbers and symbols that look like a math problem. Let's try to make sense of it!

First, I'll do the simplest parts. Probably, we should add 2 and 5 together because there are parentheses around them. So, let's do that:

4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3

Now I have:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I'll do the multiplication since there are numbers being multiplied. Let's do the one on the left first:

28 (4 * 7) + 12 - 2 * 3

Now I have:
28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I'll do the addition and subtraction. I'll start with the subtraction, then the addition since there's a minus sign before the multiplication:

28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Now I have:
28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right:

Total: 39

So, the solution to the problem 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3 is 39.

The answer is 39."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: As a naive elementary school student, I would follow the order I normally do when solving a math problem. I would first add the numbers I see at the very beginning, then I would do the multiplication. So, I would do 5 + 3, which gives me 8. Then I would do the multiplication, which is 3 times 2, which equals 6. So, I would have to do the addition part again because I made a mistake by doing multiplication after addition, but this time I would do it correctly by performing the multiplication first, which is 3 times 2 equals 6. Then I add the result of the multiplication to the initial sum, so 5 + 3 equals 8, and then 8 plus 6 gives the final answer.

The answer is: 14.

(Note: As a reminder, the correct order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS or parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction, should have been followed to get the correct answer: 5 + (3 * 2) = 5 + 6 = 11.)"
