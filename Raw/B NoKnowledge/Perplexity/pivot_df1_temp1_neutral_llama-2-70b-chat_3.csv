llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, so we have 5 plus 2 times 4.

First, I think we should do the multiplication. 2 times 4 is equal to 8.

Now, we add 5 and 8, and that gives us 13.

So, the answer is 13.

The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you please explain it to me?

Oh, you want me to solve the problem now? Okay, let me try.

I think I should multiply 7 and 2 first because they are next to each other. That gives me 14.

Then, I should multiply 8 and 5 because they are next to each other. That gives me 40.

Now, I add 14 and 40, and that gives me 54.

The answer is 54.

Is that correct? Did I do it right?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Hmm, I'm not sure how to do this problem. I know I need to follow some steps, but I don't know what they are. I think I need to do the multiplication first, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 3. That gives me 12. Next, I need to add 2 to 12, so that gives me 14. The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Hey, I'm just a grade 6 student, and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll try my best to solve this math problem!

Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 multiplied by something. That's easy, I know how to do that! It's 4 times 2 plus 5, right? That's 4 times 7, which is 28.

Next, there's a plus sign, and then a 12. Hmm, I'm not sure what to do with that. Do I add 12 to 28? That doesn't seem right. Oh wait, I remember my teacher saying something about parentheses! I think I need to do whatever is inside the parentheses first.

So, I see a 2 inside the parentheses, and then a plus sign, and then a 5. Hmm, that looks like addition to me! I know how to add! So, I'll add 2 and 5, and that's 7.

Now, there's a minus sign, and then a 2 times 3. Wait, I know how to do that too! That's just like multiplying, right? So, 2 times 3 is 6.

Okay, so now I have 28 plus 7 minus 6. That's easy! It's 29!

The answer is 29."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know I have to follow some rules to solve this problem. I remember my teacher saying something about ""order of operations.""

So, first, I'll do the multiplication: 3*2 = 6

Next, I'll add 5 and 6: 5 + 6 = 11

Therefore, the answer is 11.

The answer is 11."

Okay, so the problem is 7*2+8*5. I know that 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40.

So, if I add 14 and 40, I get 54.

The answer is 54.

I hope that's right!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm trying to solve this math problem, and I'm not really sure how to do it. I've been told to follow some steps called PEMDAS, but I don't really understand what that means. Can you help me out?

Okay, so the problem is 4*3+2. I think I'm supposed to multiply 4 and 3 first, so that's 12. Then, I add 2 to 12, and that's 14.

So, the answer is 14.

I hope that's right! I'm really not sure if I did it correctly, but I tried my best. Can you tell me if I'm wrong?"

Okay, so I see a bunch of numbers and symbols here. Let's start with the multiplication. I know that 4 times 2 is 8, and 4 times 5 is 20. So, 4*(2+5) is 8 + 20 = 28.

Next, I see a plus sign followed by 12. That means I need to add 12 to 28, so that's 40.

Finally, there's a minus sign followed by 2 times 3. That means I need to subtract 6 from 40, which gives me 34.

So, the answer is 34!"

Okay, so I know that 5 + 3 is 8, and 3 * 2 is 6. I'm not sure what to do next. Can you tell me how to solve this problem step by step?

Oh, I see! So, I should do the multiplication first, then the addition? Like this: 3*2 = 6, and then 5 + 6 = 11?

The answer is 11."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Okay, so we have this math problem: 5+2*4. Let's see... first, we have the number 5. That's easy! Then, we have 2*4. I know that 2 times 4 is 8, so I'll write that down. Now, we add 5 and 8, and that gives us... (thinking) ...13! The answer is 13. ðŸ˜Š"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm not sure what this ""order of operations"" thing is, but I'll give it my best shot.

So, the first thing I see is the multiplication symbol, which is a big ""X"" looking thing. It looks like we're supposed to do some multiplying before we do anything else.

Okay, so the first multiplication problem is 7 times 2. That's easy! 7 times 2 is 14.

Next, there's another multiplication problem, 8 times 5. That's also easy! 8 times 5 is 40.

Now, I'm not sure what to do next. I see a plus sign (+) and a number 8. I'm not sure what that's supposed to mean. Do I add 8 to 14? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, I know! I remember my teacher saying something about adding and subtracting from left to right. So, I'll add 14 and 40 first. That gives me 54.

Now, I see the plus sign (+) again, and the number 8. I'll add 8 to 54, and that gives me 62.

The answer is 62!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that when we multiply numbers, we do it from left to right. So, first, I'll do 4*3, which is 12.

Then, there's a plus sign, so I'll add 2 to 12, which is 14.

So, the answer is 14!

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. I know that PEMDAS is important in math, but I don't understand what it stands for or why it matters. Can you explain it to me?

Okay, I think I understand a little bit now. So, PEMDAS stands for ""Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction."" That means we have to follow a certain order when we're doing math problems, right? Like, we have to do the things inside parentheses first, then exponents, then multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction.

So, let's try to solve the problem again. First, we need to do the things inside parentheses. There's a 2 and a 5 inside parentheses, so we need to add them together. That's 7. Then, we have to do the exponents. There's a 4 outside the parentheses, so we need to raise it to the power of 2. That's 16. Next, we have to do the multiplication and division. There's a 12 and a 3, so we need to multiply 12 by 3, which is 36. Finally, we have to do the addition and subtraction. We have to add 36 and 7, which is 43.

The answer is 43.

I hope that's right! I'm still a little confused about PEMDAS, but I think I'm starting to understand it a little better. Can you give me some more problems to practice with?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: I don't know what PEMDAS means, but I can try to solve the problem.

First, I see a 5 and a 3, so I think I should add them together. That gives me 8.

Next, I see a 2 and a multiplication sign, so I think I should multiply 3 and 2 together. That gives me 6.

Now, I don't know what to do. I have 8 and 6, but I don't know how to make them work together. Can you help me?

The answer is... um... 14? No, that's not right. I think the answer is 16. Is that correct?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this...

Okay, I know that when you have a bunch of numbers and operations in a problem, you need to follow a special order to make sure you do the right operations in the right order. My teacher calls it PEMDAS, but I'm not sure what that means.

So, let's see... the problem is 5+2*4. I know I need to do the multiplication first, because that's what we do before we add. So, I'll do 2*4, which is 8. Now, I add 5 and 8, and that gives me 13.

The answer is 13!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Okay! Let's see...

First, I know that when we have numbers being multiplied together, we should do those calculations first. So, I'll start by multiplying 7 and 2 together. That gives me 14.

Next, I'll multiply 8 and 5 together. That gives me 40.

Now, I need to add 14 and 40 together. When I do that, I get 54.

The answer is 54."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do multiplication before addition, but I don't know why. It just sounds like a rule that my teacher made up!

So, I'm gonna do the multiplication part first. 4 times 3 is... um... *counts on fingers*... 12!

Now, I have to add 2 to that. *adds 2 to 12*

The answer is 14!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Okay, let's see...

First, we need to do the addition inside the parentheses. That's 2+5, which is 7.

Next, we multiply 4 by 7, and that's 28.

Then, we add 12 to 28, and that's 40.

Finally, we subtract 2 times 3, which is 6.

So, the final answer is 40 - 6, which is 34.

The answer is 34."

Okay, so we have 5 + 3 * 2, right? I think we should start by adding 5 and 3, that's easy! 5 + 3 = 8.

Now, we have 8 * 2, that's also easy! 8 * 2 = 16.
