      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll give it my best shot!<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4* thingy. I think that means I have to multiply 4 and 2 + 5. That's easy, it's like, 4 x 7, which is 28.<br><br>Next, there's this plus sign (+) and it's followed by 12. I think that means I have to add 12 to 28. That's simple, 28 + 12 = 40.<br><br>Oh, wait! There's a minus sign (-) and it's followed by 2 times 3. That means I have to subtract 6 from 40. That's easy, 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>So, the answer is 34!<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is 4 times something. That's easy, I know my multiplication facts! 4 times 2 is 8, and 4 times 5 is 20. Adding them together gives me 28.<br><br>Next, I see a plus sign followed by 12. That means I add 12 to my previous answer, which is 28. So, my new answer is 40.<br><br>After that, I see a minus sign followed by 2 times 3. That means I have to subtract 6 from my previous answer. So, my final answer is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what this stuff is about, but I'll try my best!<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is 4 and then some stuff inside the parentheses. I think we're supposed to do what's inside the parentheses first, so that's what I'll do.<br><br>Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5. Hmm... I know how to add! Let's see... 2 + 5 is... (thinking) 7!<br><br>Okay, so now we have 4 times 7. That's... (thinking) 28!<br><br>But wait, there's more! We have some more things to do. There's a plus sign and then 12. Oh, and then there's a minus sign and 2 times 3.<br><br>I think we're supposed to do the addition before the subtraction, so let's do the addition first. 28 + 12 is... (thinking) 40!<br><br>Now, we have to subtract 2 times 3. That's... (thinking) 6.<br><br>So, if we subtract 6 from 40, we get... (thinking) 34!<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! Let's see...<br><br>First, we have the part in parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Next, we multiply 4 by 7: 4*7 = 28<br><br>Then, we add 12: 28 + 12 = 40<br><br>Last, we subtract 2 times 3: 40 - 6 = 34<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm just a grade 6 student, and I'm not too sure about this order of operations thingy. But I'll give it my best shot.<br><br>Okay, so the problem is 4*3 + 2. I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 3. That gives me 12.<br><br>Next, I have to add 2 to 12.

      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But let's try to solve this math problem together!<br><br>Okay, so we have 4*3, that's 12, right? And then we have + 2, that's 14.<br><br>So, the answer is 14!<br><br>I hope that's correct! Can you tell me if I did it right? ðŸ˜Š<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so we have a big number, 4, and it's multiplying a smaller number, 3. That's like, 4 groups of 3 things, right? So, 4*3 is equal to 12.<br><br>And then, there's a plus sign, and it's telling us to add 2 to 12. So, 4*3 + 2 is equal to 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

So, I'm gonna do the multiplication first.<br><br>4 times 3 is 12.<br><br>Now, I have to add 2 to 12.<br><br>12 + 2 is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
