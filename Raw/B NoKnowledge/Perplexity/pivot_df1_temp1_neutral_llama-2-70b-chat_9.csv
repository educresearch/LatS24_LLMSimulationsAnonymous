llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I've got this math problem here, and I'm supposed to follow some thing called PEMDAS. I'm not really sure what that means, but I'll do my best to figure it out.

Okay, so the first thing I see is a 5. That's a pretty easy number, so I'll just leave it alone for now. Next, I see a 2 and a 4. These numbers are multiplying each other, so I'll do that next. 2 times 4 is 8.

Now, I see a plus sign, and that means I need to add something. I've got my 5 and my 8. Let's see... 5 plus 8 is 13!

The answer is 13.

I hope that's right! Did I do okay following PEMDAS?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Hey, I'm just a grade 6 student, and I'm not sure about this order of operations thing. But, I'll give it my best shot!

Okay, so I see there are a bunch of numbers and operations in this problem. Let's see... I know I have to follow some rules, but I'm not sure what they are. Oh wait, I remember! My teacher said something about ""PEMDAS""... What does that mean?

Oh yeah, it means ""Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction."" That sounds like a lot to remember! But, I'll try my best.

So, let's see... There aren't any parentheses or exponents in this problem, so I can skip those parts. Next, I need to do the multiplications and divisions from left to right. Okay, I can do that!

First, I'll multiply 7 and 2, and that gives me 14. Then, I'll multiply 8 and 5, and that gives me 40.

Next, I need to do the additions and subtractions from left to right. Hmm... I'm not sure which ones to do first. Oh well, I'll just do them in the order they appear.

So, I'll add 14 and 40, and that gives me 54.

The answer is 54!

I hope that's right!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know I have to follow some rules when doing math problems, but I don't know what they are called. I think I have to do the multiplication first, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 3, which gives me 12.

Next, I have to add 2 to 12, which gives me 14.

So, the answer is 14.

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it my best shot.

So, the problem is 4*(2+5)+12-2*3, right? I think I'll start by multiplying 4 and 2+5, that's 4*7=28.

Next, I see a plus sign, so I'll add 12 to 28, that's 40.

Now, there's a minus sign, so I'll subtract 2 times 3 from 40, that's 40-6=34.

The answer is 34!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it my best shot. Okay, so we have 5 + 3 * 2... hmmm... I think we should do the multiplication first because it's inside the parentheses, right? So, 3 * 2 = 6. Now, we add 5 to 6 and get 11. The answer is 11! ðŸ˜Š"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll give it my best shot!

So, 5+2*4... hmmm... I think I should start by multiplying 2 and 4. That's easy, it's just 8!

Now, I have 5 + 8... oh wait, I think I need to add 5 and 8! Okay, that's 13.

The answer is 13!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm trying to solve this math problem, and I'm not sure how to do it. I know I need to follow some rules, but I don't know what they are. I think I need to do the multiplication first, so I'll start by multiplying 7 and 2. That gives me 14.

Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 and the parentheses, so I'll start by multiplying 4 by what's inside the parentheses. That's 4*7, which is 28.

Next, I see the 12, so I'll add that to 28. That gives me 40.

Now, I see the -2*3. I'm not sure what that means, but I think it means I have to subtract 6 from 40. So, 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know that in math, we have something called PEMDAS. It stands for ""Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction."" But I don't really get what that means.

So, let's try to solve this problem, 5+3*2. I know that 3*2 is 6, so I think the problem is 5+6. That's easy, it's 11.

The answer is 11."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know I have to follow some rules to solve this problem. I remember my teacher saying something about doing things in a special order.

First, I see a multiplication sign, so I know I have to do that part first. 2 times 4 is equal to 8.

Next, I see a addition sign, so I add 5 and 8 together. 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13.

I hope that's right!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Okay, so we have this math problem: 7*2+8*5.

First, let's do the multiplication. That means we need to multiply the numbers together.

7*2 = 14 (I know my times tables!)
8*5 = 40 (I know my times tables too!)

Now, we need to add the two numbers together.
14 + 40 = 54

So, the answer to the problem is 54.
The answer is 54."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Hmm... let me think about this one...

Okay, so we have 4 multiplied by 3, that's 12. Then we have 2 added to that, so that's 12 + 2, which is 14.

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Hey, I'm not sure how to do this thing with all these letters and stuff. Can you help me out?

Okay, so I see there are some numbers and symbols here. Let's see... 4 times 2 is 8, plus 5 is 13, and then plus 12 is... hmmm... 25? No, that can't be right.

Oh wait, I see! There's this thing called PEMDAS, right? So that means we have to do the stuff inside the parentheses first.

So, 2+5 is 7, and then 4 times 7 is... carry the 1... 28! And then plus 12 is 40.

But wait, there's more! There's a minus sign here too! 2 times 3 is 6, and then minus 6 is... 34!

The answer is 34.

I hope that's right! Can you tell me if I did it correctly?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know I have to follow some rules to solve this problem. I think it's like this:

First, I have to do the things inside the parentheses. There are no parentheses here, so I can skip that step.

Next, I have to do the exponents. There are no exponents here, so I can skip that step too.

Then, I have to do the multiplication. Oh wait, there is a multiplication sign! It says 3*2. I know that means I have to multiply 3 and 2 together. That's easy, it's 6.

Finally, I have to do the addition. There's only one addition sign, and it's at the very end. It says 5+6. That's easy too, it's 11.

So, the answer is 11!

The answer is 11."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do something with these numbers, but I'm not sure what. Let me think... Oh, I know! I can start by adding 5 and 2. That's easy, it's like counting on my fingers. 5 + 2 = 7.

Now, I know I have to do something with the 4, but I'm not sure what. Wait, I remember! My teacher said something about multiplication being like repeated addition. So, if I have 2 groups of 4 things, that's like having 8 things altogether!

So, I can multiply 2 and 4 by adding 8: 2 x 4 = 8.

Now, I have to add 7 and 8 together. That's easy: 7 + 8 = 15.

The answer is 15."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Hey, I'm just a kid in elementary school, but I'll give it my best shot!

Okay, so I know that when we multiply numbers, we need to do it in a special order. It's like a recipe! We have to follow the steps in the right order or it won't turn out right.

So, first, I'll multiply 7 and 2. That gives me 14.

Then, I'll multiply 8 and 5. That gives me 40.

Next, I'll add 14 and 40. That gives me 54.

The answer is 54!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Okay, so we have this problem: 4*3+2.

First, let's do the multiplication: 4 times 3 is 12.

Now, we have 12 plus 2, which is 14.

So, the answer is 14.

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Okay, let's see...

First, we need to do the addition inside the parentheses. That's 2+5, which is 7.

Next, we multiply 4 by 7, and that's 28.

Then, we add 12 to 28, and that's 40.

Last, we subtract 2 times 3, which is 6.

So, the final answer is 34.

The answer is 34."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Okay, I'm thinking...

First, let me do the addition: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, I have to multiply 8 by 2: 8 * 2 = 16

So, the answer is 16!

The answer is 16."
