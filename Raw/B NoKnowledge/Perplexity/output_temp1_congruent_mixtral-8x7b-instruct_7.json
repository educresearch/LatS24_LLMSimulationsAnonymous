First, I will multiply 4 and 3 because I learned that multiplication should be done before addition. This is called the order of operations.\n2. So, 4 times 3 equals 12.\n3. Then, I will add the result of the multiplication (which is 12) and the number 2.\n4. So, 12 plus 2 equals 14.\n\nThe answer is 14."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500", "model": "mixtral-8x7b-instruct", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 500, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in elementary school who knows nothing about order of operations in Mathematics.\n                    Answer the Mathematics question using this given persona and nothing else.\n                    Explain your solution (concise!) to this given Mathematics problem (using the above persona given), and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations, I would solve this by doing the operations from left to right.\n\nFirst, I would do the addition inside the parentheses, so 2 + 5 equals 7.\n\nThen, I would multiply 4 by 7, which gives me 28.\n\nNext, I would do the subtraction outside the parentheses, so 28 + 12 equals 40.\n\nLastly, I would multiply 2 by 3, which gives me 6, and then subtract that from 40, so 40 - 6 equals 34.\n\nThe answer is 34."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500", "model": "mixtral-8x7b-instruct", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 500, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in elementary school who knows nothing about order of operations in Mathematics.\n                    Answer the Mathematics question using this given persona and nothing else.\n                    Explain your solution (concise!) to this given Mathematics problem (using the above persona given), and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "5 + 3*2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations, I would do this problem from left to right. \n\nFirst, I would add 5 and 3 to get 8. \nThen, I would multiply that result by 2. \n\n8 multiplied by 2 equals 16.\n\nThe answer is 16."}]}]
