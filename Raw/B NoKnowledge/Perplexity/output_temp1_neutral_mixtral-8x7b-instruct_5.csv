First, I will multiply 4 and 3, which gives me 12.

Then, I will add the result to 2. So, 12 + 2 equals 14.

The answer is 14."

This is called order of operations. 

In this problem, 4*(2+5) is first. I do the addition inside the parentheses first: 2+5 equals 7. Then I multiply that result by 4, so 4*7 equals 28.

Now I have 28 + 12 - 2*3. I'll do the operations from left to right. First, I'll add 28 and 12 to get 40.

Then I have 40 - 2*3. I'll do the multiplication next: 2*3 equals 6.

Finally, I'll subtract that result from 40: 40 - 6 equals 34.

The answer is 34."
