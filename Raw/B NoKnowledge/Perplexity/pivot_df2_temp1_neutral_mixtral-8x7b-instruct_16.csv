mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Okay, so I don't know about this ""order of operations"" thing, but I know how to do math. I'll just do the operations from left to right.

First, I'll do the addition in the first parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.

Now, the expression looks like this: 4 \* 7 + 12 - 2 \* 3

Next, I'll do the multiplication: 4 \* 7 equals 28 and 2 \* 3 equals 6.

The expression now looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

I'll continue from left to right. First, I'll do the addition: 28 + 12 equals 40.

Now the expression looks like this: 40 - 6

Lastly, I'll do the subtraction: 40 - 6 equals 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Well, I don't know about any special rules for doing math, so I'll just solve this from left to right. That's what you do usually, right?

First, do the operations inside the parentheses:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Then, continue from left to right:
First, multiply:
28 + 12 - 6

And then add and subtract in order:
First add:
40 - 6

Then subtract:
The answer is 34.","GPT Response: I would add and subtract first because that's what I would do naturally. So I would add 2 + 5 to get 7, then multiply that by 4 to get 28. After that, I would subtract 2 because that's the next operation, and I get 26. Then I would multiply 2 and 3 to get 6, and subtract that from 26 to get 20.

The answer is 20.","GPT Response: I don't know about order of operations, so I'll just do the math from left to right. First, I'll do the addition and subtraction inside the parentheses:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Then, I'll do the multiplication:

28 + 12 - 6

Next, I'll do addition and subtraction from left to right:

40 - 6

Finally,

The answer is 34."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the operations from left to right. So I would first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then I would add 2 to get 14.

So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a sixth-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will simply solve this by doing the operations from left to right.

First, I'll multiply 4 and 3, which gives me 12.
Then, I'll add the result to 2.

12 + 2 is 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: I would first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then I would add 2 to 12 to get 14. So the answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I would first guess that the answer is 14 because I would do the multiplication and addition at the same time. But I know my answer should be checked, so I'll ask my teacher or look it up to find out the correct way to solve it.

It turns out that there's something called BIDMAS or PEMDAS, which tells us the correct order to do operations in math. BIDMAS stands for Brackets, Indices (or Exponents), Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). PEMDAS is similar, standing for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So, using BIDMAS or PEMDAS, I should do the multiplication before the addition:

4 * 3 = 12
Then add 2:
12 + 2 = 14

So, the answer is 14."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: As a 6th grade student who doesn't know about order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the addition and multiplication from left to right. So I would add 5 and 2 to get 7, then multiply that result by 4. Doing that gives me 28. But I've made a mistake, because I didn't follow the order of operations.

Actually, I should have followed the order of operations, which says to do multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. So first, I should multiply 2 by 4 to get 8, and then add 5 to get 13.

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: As a 6th grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think about doing the addition and multiplication from left to right.

So, I would first add 5 and 2 to get 7.
Then, I would multiply 7 by 4 to get 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Hmm, I'm not sure about this, but I think I should do the multiplication part first because we should always do the operations in parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). That's what my teacher said.

So, first, I do 2 times 4 which is 8.

Then, I add 5 to the result of that multiplication.

So, 5 plus 8 is 13.

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't know much about order of operations yet. But I remember my teacher saying something about multplication and division being done before addition and subtraction. So for this problem, I will first multiply 2 and 4 to get 8, then add 5 to it.

The answer is 13."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the addition and multiplication from left to right. So I would add 5 and 3 to get 8, and then multiply that result by 2. Doing this, I get 16.

However, I recently learned that there is a specific order to follow when there are multiple operations in a math problem. We should first do any operations inside parentheses, then exponents, then multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is called PEMDAS.

So, for the problem 5 + 3 * 2, even though I was tempted to add 5 and 3 first, I now know that I should do the multiplication before the addition. Doing the multiplication first, I get 3 * 2 = 6. Then, adding 5, I get 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Well, I'm a student in grade 6 and I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS) in Mathematics. But I can still try to solve this problem.

First, I would do the addition because that's what I see first. So, I would add 5 and 3 to get 8.

Then, I would multiply the result by 2. So, I would multiply 8 by 2 to get 16.

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: I don't know about any order of operations rule, so I will just solve this from left to right. First, I will add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then I will multiply that result by 2. So, 8 times 2 equals 16.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think about doing the multiplication and addition in the order they appear. But that might give the wrong answer, so I need to be careful.

Looking at the problem again, I see that there are two sets of numbers being multiplied: 7*2 and 8*5. I guess I could do those multiplications first, and then add the results together.

So, I'd calculate 7*2 first, which equals 14. Then I'd calculate 8*5, which equals 40.

Now, I have two numbers, 14 and 40. I can add those together to get the final answer:

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Well, I don't know about any special rules like PEMDAS, so I'll just do the operations in the order they appear.

First, I'll do 7 times 2, which equals 14.
Then, I'll do 8 times 5, which equals 40.
Finally, I'll add those two results together.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: If I was given the math problem 7*2 + 8*5 without knowing about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first multiply and then add. This is because I would do the operations from left to right.

Here's how I would solve it:

1. Multiply 7 and 2 to get 14.
2. Multiply 8 and 5 to get 40.
3. Add 14 and 40 to get 54.
