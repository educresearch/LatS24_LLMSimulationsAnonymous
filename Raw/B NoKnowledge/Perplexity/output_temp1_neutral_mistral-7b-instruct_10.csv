Let's give it a try with this problem: 5 + 2 * 4.

First, we look for any parentheses, but there aren't any. Next, we check for exponents, but we don't have any of those either. Since there's no multiplication inside any addition or subtraction, we just follow the rule that multiplication should be done before addition, also known as the PEMDAS rule. So, we'll do the multiplication first: 2 * 4 = 8. Now, we add the numbers: 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is __.

I will try to solve this problem with simpler addition, subtraction, multiplication, and then lastly do the amalgamated addition and subtraction. Let's break down the problem.

First, let's do the multiplication:
4 * (2 + 5)

Now, we are supposed to follow the rules of multiplication first, but since I don't know PEMDAS, I'll do the addition inside the parentheses first:

4 * (2 + 5)
= 4 * (7) - (I guessed this was the correct order, but it isn't actually)

Second, time for the addition inside the parentheses:
4 * 7

Now, we should have done multiplication first, but since I didn't know better, let's carry on with addition and subtraction.

So, my work so far: 4 * 7

Next is subtraction:
4 * 7 - 12

Lastly, multiplication:
(4 * 7) - 12
= 28 - 12

My final answer, as a grade 6 student who didn't know PEMDAS yet:
The answer is 16.

However, this is incorrect since we should have followed the PEMDAS rule and done the multiplication first:

4 *(2 + 5) = 4 * (7) = 28
28 + 12 = 40

So, the actual answer should be 40."

First, I'll do the multiplication part: 2 times 4 equals 8.

So, here's the solution using the advice of a fictional imaginary teacher: We did the multiplication first because the asterisk (*) looks like it's asking for it to be done before the addition sign (+), but in reality, with simple numbers like these, it doesn't really matter much if we follow that hint or not. But let's go with what the asterisk suggests for now: The answer is 13.

However, this technique might not always be correct and could lead to incorrect answers with more complicated expressions, as there is a systematic rule called the ""PEMDAS"" algorithm that helps us solve expressions more accurately, and following it is essential to ensure the proper execution of Mathematical operations. I will share this information with my teacher and my classmates when we learn about order of operations in the future.

The answer is 13, but keep in mind that this technique may not apply to all Mathematical problems."

First, I'll do any multiplication because it comes before addition and subtraction (that's what I heard from someone). So, I'll do 7 times 2 first: that's 14. Now, let's do 8 times 5: that's 40.

Next, since addition comes before subtraction, I'll add the results of the multiplication: 14 and 40. So, 14 + 40 equals...

The answer is __.
54. (That's 14 + 40!)"

First, I'll focus on the operation inside the parentheses: 2. Since I don't know about order of operations, I'll just do the multiplication and addition one at a time the way they appear.

So, I'll start with the multiplication: 4 * 3. That gives me 12.

Now, I have 12 and I'm supposed to add 2. So, I'll get the sum of 12 and 2. Which gives me 14.

The answer is __.
The answer is 14."

First, let's do the addition inside the parentheses:

2 + 5 = 7

So now we have:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, let's do the multiplication:

4 * 7 = 28
12 * 3 = 36

So now we have:

28 + 36 - 2 * 3

Then, let's do the remaining addition and subtraction:

28 + 36 = 64
64 - 2 * 3 = 64 - 6 = 58

The answer is 58."
