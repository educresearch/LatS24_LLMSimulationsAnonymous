mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know about the order of operations in mathematics yet. Let me try to make sense of it based on what I see. Since the plus sign (5 +) is there before the multiplication sign (2 *), I thought I should add first. So I would do:

5 + 2 * 4

But then I'm not sure if that's correct since I've heard that sometimes we should do the multiplication first. Let me ask my teacher for help.

The answer is __. (I don't have an answer yet, I need to ask my teacher for help first)."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations in mathematics, which is also known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction). Since I don't know the correct sequence, I'll approach this problem by doing the multiplications first, then the addition:

1. Multiply 7 * 2 = 14
2. Multiply 8 * 5 = 40
3. Perform the addition: 14 + 40 = 54

The answer is __54__."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm in grade 6 and I've never heard about order of operations. But, I can try to solve this math problem by guessing what could be the right way.

First, I'll do the multiplication because I see numbers with a symbol between them. So, that's 4 times 3 which equals 12.

Next, I'll do the addition because there is a plus sign between two numbers. So, that's 12 plus 2 which equals 14.

The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I don't know much about order of operations in mathematics yet. But I can try to solve the expression step by step.

First, let's do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.

Next, we'll do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28.

Now, we have 28 and 12, so we'll subtract: 28 - 12 = 16.

Finally, we have 16 and 2, so we'll subtract again: 16 - 2 = 14.

So, the final answer is this: The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations in mathematics. But, I can try to solve the problem by doing the multiplication first, and then adding. So, let's do it!

The problem is: 5 + 3 * 2

First, we do the multiplication:
3 * 2 = 6

Now, we substitute the result back into the equation and do the addition:
5 + 6

The answer is: 11."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I have not learned about the order of operations in mathematics yet. So, I will solve this problem by doing the multiplication first, then adding the numbers. It looks like there's multiplication in the problem (2*4), so let's do that first:

2 * 4 = 8

Now, I have the number 8, and I need to add 5. So, I will add 5 to 8:

8 + 5 = 13

The answer is __.
Answer: 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Well, I'm just a grade 6 student and I haven't learned about the order of operations yet. But let's try and solve this problem step by step:

First, I'll do the multiplication since that comes before addition and subtraction according to the rules I've heard grown-ups talk about. So, that's 7 times 2 and 8 times 5:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now, I'll do the addition:

14 (from the first multiplication)
+ 40 (from the second multiplication)

The answer is 54.

So, according to my understanding based on what adults have told me, the answer to the problem 7 * 2 + 8 * 5 should be 54. Isn't that interesting? Math can be fun, even without knowing all the rules! But remember, I'm just a grade 6 student, so take my solution with a grain of salt. :)"
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I have not learned about the order of operations yet. So, let's just follow the simple rule: multiplication before addition.

First, I'll do the multiplication: 4*3 = 12

Then, I'll do the addition: 12 + 2 = 14

So, the answer is: The answer is 14."

mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS is. But I think I should do the multiplication first because I've been taught that you do multiplication before addition. So, I'll do 7*2 and 8*5 separately.

7*2 = 14
8*5 = 40

Now I have 14 and 40. Then I'll do the addition.

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: I'm not sure what the letters in PEMDAS mean, but I see some numbers and symbols in front of me. Let's do this step by step:

First, I see the number 4 with a star (*) and the number 3. I don't know what the star means, but I think I should do this part first because it comes before the plus sign. So I'll do 4 multiplied by 3:

12 (4 * 3)

Now, I have the number 12 and the number 2 with a plus sign (+) in between. I think I should add those numbers because the plus sign is before anything else:

14 (12 + 2)

The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I have not learned about the order of operations (PEMDAS) yet. However, I can try to solve the problem by doing the operations inside the parentheses first, then any multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right.

So, the problem becomes:

1.First, solve the addition inside the parentheses: 
2 + 5 = 7

2.Next, do the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28

3.Then, subtract:
28 - 12 = 16

4.Lastly, do any remaining addition or subtraction:
16 + 3 = 19

The answer is 19."

5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Hmm, this problem looks a bit confusing to me since I don't know anything about the order of operations yet. But let me try to solve it by doing the simplest calculations first.  Circle narrative here: I'll start by adding 5 and 2, which gives me 7. Then I'll take the result, 7, and multiply it by 4. That results in 28. So in simple terms, I added 5 and 2 first, and then multiplied the answer by 4.

The answer is 28."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Well, I don't really know about the rules for solving math problems yet, but I think I'll try to do this one by doing the multiplication first, then the addition. That way, it seems like I'm following the order of the operations from left to right. So, let's do the multiplication first:

7*2 = 14
8*5 = 40

Now, I have two numbers: 14 and 40. And I need to add them. So, I'll just do that:

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is __.
Answer: 54."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*3+2,"GPT Response: I see numbers and symbols on this paper. The plus sign (+) means we add, and the asterisk (*) means we multiply. But I don't know in what order we should do these operations. Let's try both ways and see what happens!

First, I'll do the multiplication (4 * 3) and then the addition (12 + 2).

But wait! I changed my mind. Maybe I should do the addition first (3 + 2 = 5) and then the multiplication (5 * 4 = 20).

Now, let me compare the results of both methods to find out which one is correct.

First method: 4 * 3 + 2 = ?
Second method: 3 + 2 * 4 = ?

Let's check which one is the right answer!

We'll calculate both results and see which one fits the problem:

First method: 4 * 3 + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14
Second method: 3 + 2 * 4 = 3 + 8 = 11

Oops! It looks like my second method gave me the wrong answer. So the correct one should be:

The answer is **14**."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: As a fourth grader, I don't know about the order of operations yet. But I can do the addition and multiplication, then the subtraction. So I'll start by doing the numbers in the parentsheses: 2 + 5 = 7. Now I have 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, I'll do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28. Now I have 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Then, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 38. Now I have 38 - 2 * 3.

Lastly, I'll do the multiplication and subtraction from left to right: 38 - 2 * 3 = 38 - 6.

The answer is 32."

First, I see * (multiplication sign) before + (addition sign), so I thought maybe we do the multiplication first. Let's try that and see:

3 multiplied by 2 equals 6

Now, I have 5 and 6. I think addition comes before multiplication, right? So let's add those numbers:

5 + 6 equals 11

So, according to my thought process, the answer is:

The answer is 11."
