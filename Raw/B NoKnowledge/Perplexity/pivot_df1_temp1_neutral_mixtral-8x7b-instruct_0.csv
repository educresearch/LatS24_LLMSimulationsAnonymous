mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the addition and multiplication from left to right. So I would add 5 and 2 to get 7, then multiply that result by 4.

Doing so, I get 7 * 4, which equals 28.

The answer is 28."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Okay, so if I were a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would just solve this math problem from left to right. This method is called ""straight line"" or ""regrouping"" method.

So, let's do the math:
7 × 2 = 14
Now, add the next part:
14 + 8 × 5
To solve this, I would continue doing the multiplication first:
8 × 5 = 40
Now, add this result to the previous sum:
14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Well, as a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations, I would first think of doing the multiplication and then the addition. So I would multiply 4 and 3 to get 12, and then add 2 to get 14.

So, the answer is 14."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Okay, as a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will try to solve this step by step. I think I should do the addition and subtraction inside the parentheses first, then the multiplication and division from left to right.

So, first, I will add 2 + 5, which equals 7. Then I have:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I will do the multiplication and division from left to right:

28 + 12 - 6

And finally, I will do addition and subtraction from left to right:

40 - 6

The answer is 34."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the addition since that's what I learned so far. But I might remember my teacher mentioning something about multiplying before adding, so I'll ask my teacher or a classmate to be sure.

So, following the order of operations (PEMDAS), even though I don't know that name yet, I should do the multiplication first:

3 * 2 = 6

Then I add that result to 5:

5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Well, I'm in grade 6 and I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS). So I will just solve this from left to right.

First, I will add 5 and 2 which gives me 7.
Then I will multiply that result by 4.

So, 5 + 2 * 4 = 7 * 4.

Now, if I multiply 7 by 4, I get 28.

The answer is 28."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Well, as a 6th grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would just do the math from left to right.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm a student in grade 6 and I don't know about the order of operations in Mathematics yet. But let me try to solve this problem: 4 \* 3 + 2.

First, I would do the multiplication because that's the first thing I think of when I see numbers together. So I would calculate 4 \* 3 to get 12.

Then, I have 12 + 2, which is easy to add up to get 14.

So, the answer is 14."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Well, I don't know about any special rules like PEMDAS, so I'll just do the operations in the order they appear. First, I'll add 2 and 5 to get 7. Then I'll multiply that by 4 to get 28. Next, I'll add 12 to get 40. After that, I'll multiply 2 and 3 to get 6. Finally, I'll subtract that from 40 to get the answer.

The answer is 34."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Well, as a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the addition because that's what I learned earlier. But sometimes, I notice that my answers are different from my friends or my teacher's. So, if I follow the instructions given by my teacher, I should do the multiplication before the addition.

First, I'll multiply 3 and 2 to get 6, then add 5 to it.

So, 3 times 2 is 6, and 5 plus 6 is 11.

The answer is 11."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Hmm, this looks like a math problem, but there are no numbers to plug into a formula. I remember my teacher saying something about ""order of operations"" which helps us figure out how to solve problems like this one. It goes Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). I see that there are no parentheses or exponents here, but there is multiplication before addition.

So, I'll multiply 2 and 4 first to get 8, and then add 5 to get 13.

The answer is 13."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: If I was given the math problem 7*2 + 8*5 and I didn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would still try to solve it. But, I might not get the correct answer because order of operations is a rule that tells us to do certain operations before others.

First, I would probably add 7 and 2 to get 9, and then add 8 and 5 to get 13. Then, I would add those two results together to get 22.

However, if I followed the order of operations, I would first multiply 7 by 2 to get 14, and then multiply 8 by 5 to get 40. Finally, I would add those two results together to get 54.

So, even though I don't know about order of operations, I can still try to solve the problem. But, I won't get the correct answer without following the order of operations.

The answer is 22 (but it should be 54 if we follow the order of operations)."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: I would first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then I would add 2 to 12 to get 14. So the answer is 14.

The answer is 14."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Hmm, I don't know what order of operations is, but I remember my teacher saying something about adding and subtracting before multiplying and dividing. Let's see, this problem has adding, multiplying, and dividing. 

First, I'll do the adding inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7. 

Now it looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I'll do the multiplying: 4 times 7 is 28, and 2 times 3 is 6.

Now it looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

Finally, I'll do the adding and subtracting from left to right: 28 plus 12 is 40, and 40 minus 6 is 34.

The answer is 34."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think about adding 5 and 3 to get 8. Then, I would multiply 3 by 2 to get 6. Finally, I would substitute these numbers back into the equation to get the final answer.

The answer is 8 + 6, which is 14."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+2*4,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't know about the order of operations rule yet. But I would try to solve this problem by doing the addition and multiplication from left to right. So first, I would add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then, I would multiply that result by 4. Doing this, I get 28.

The answer is 28."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Well, I don't know much about this order of operations thing, but I remember my teacher saying something about doing multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. So, for this question, I guess I'll first multiply 7 by 2 and 8 by 5.

7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40.

Now, I just need to add those two results together.

14 plus 40 gives me 54.

The answer is 54."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*3+2,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I will just solve this by doing the operations from left to right.

First, I will multiply 4 and 3 to get 12.
Then, I will add 2 to 12 and get 14.

The answer is 14."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: I don't know much about order of operations, but I remember my teacher saying something about BIDMAS or PEMDAS. It's like you do the operations in this order: Brackets (or Parentheses), Indices (or Exponents), Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

For the problem 4*(2+5)+12-2*3, I see addition inside the parentheses, so I'll do that first:

4*(7)+12-2*3

Then multiplication, since it's next in the order:

28+12-2*3

After that, I do addition and subtraction from left to right:

40-2*3

Then more multiplication:

40-6

And finally, subtraction:

The answer is 34."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+3*2,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I would first think of doing the addition and then the multiplication. But I remember my teacher saying something about a special rule called ""order of operations"" that tells us to do certain operations before others. I think it's because some operations are more important than others.

For multiplication and addition, I think we're supposed to do the multiplication first. So for this problem, I would do 3 times 2 first, which is 6, and then add 5 to it.

The answer is 11."
