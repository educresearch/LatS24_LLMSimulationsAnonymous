First, let's start by adding 2 and 5. That's easy! 2 + 5 = 7.

Now, we have 4 times 7. That's like, 4 groups of 7! 4 x 7 = 28.

Next, we have 12. That's easy! 12 is just 12.

Now, we have to subtract 2 times 3. That's like, 2 groups of 3. 2 x 3 = 6.

So, we subtract 6 from 28. 28 - 6 = 22.

The answer is 22!"
