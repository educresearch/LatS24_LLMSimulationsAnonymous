      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this question is asking me to do. I know I need to follow some sort of order, but I'm not sure what it is. I think it's called PEMDAS or something?<br><br>Okay, so I think I need to start by adding 2 and 5 together. That's easy, it's 7!<br><br>Next, I need to multiply 4 by 7. That's... um... 28?<br><br>Then, I need to subtract 2 times 3. That's 6, right?<br><br>Finally, I need to add 12. So, if I add 6 and 12, that's 18!<br><br>The answer is 18.<br><br>I hope that's right! Do you think that's how you're supposed to do it?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it a try.<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 multiplied by something. That something is 2+5, right? So, I'll do that first. 2+5 is equal to 7.<br><br>Now, I have 4 multiplied by 7, which is 28.<br><br>Next, I see a plus sign and a 12. I'm not sure what that's doing there, but I'll add it to my answer. So, my answer is now 28 + 12, which is 40.<br><br>Finally, I see a minus sign and a 2 times 3. I'm not sure what that means either, but I'll do it anyway. 2 times 3 is 6, so I'll subtract 6 from my answer.<br><br>The answer is 40 - 6, which is 34.<br><br>I hope that's right!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm just a kid in elementary school, and I'm not sure what this "order of operations" thing is all about. But I'll give it my best shot!<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is that big 4. It looks like it's multiplying something. Let's see... oh, it's multiplying (2+5)!! That's easy, because I know my addition facts. 2+5 is 7, so 4 times 7 is... (drumroll please)... 28!<br><br>But wait, there's more! After that, there's a plus sign and a 12. That means I have to add 12 to 28. That's easy, because I know my addition facts. 28 + 12 is... (drumroll again) 40!<br><br>Oh no, there's a minus sign! That means I have to subtract something from 40. I see a 2 and a 3, so I have to subtract 2 times 3 from 40. That's easy, because I know my multiplication facts. 2 times 3 is 6, so I have to subtract 6 from 40. That gives me... (drumroll once more) 34!<br><br>The answer is 34!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, let's see...<br><br>First, we have to do the things inside the parentheses. That's 2+5, which is 7.<br><br>So, it's 4 times 7, which is 28.<br><br>Next, we have to add 12. That makes it 40.<br><br>Last, we have to subtract 2 times 3, which is 6.<br><br>The answer is 40 - 6, which is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 and the 3, and I know that 4 is bigger than 3, so I think I should multiply them together first. That gives me 12.<br><br>Next, I see the + sign and the 2, so I add 2 to 12 and get 14.<br><br>So, the answer is 14!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm not sure what this "PEMDAS" thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>Okay, so I see a bunch of numbers and symbols here. Let's start with the multiplication symbol, which is the "*" symbol. I know that means we have to multiply two numbers together. So, I'll start by multiplying 4 and 3, which gives me 12.<br><br>Next, I see a plus sign (+) followed by the number 2. I know that means I have to add 2 to the number I just got, which is 12. So, 12 + 2 is equal to 14.<br><br>Therefore, the answer to this problem is 14!<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! So, we have this problem: 4 * 3+2.<br><br>First, let's start with the multiplication part. 4 times 3 is equal to 12.<br><br>Now, we have 12 + 2, which is equal to 14.<br><br>So, the final answer is... 14!<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, let's see...<br><br>First, I know that I need to do the multiplication before I do the addition. That's because multiplication comes first in the order of operations.
