llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what this ""PEMDAS"" thing is, but I do know that when you have a bunch of numbers and operations in a problem, you gotta follow some rules to make sure you do the right calculations first!

Okay, so in this problem, there are a few things going on. There's a 5, a 2, a 4, and some multiplication and addition symbols. I think you're supposed to do the multiplication first, so let's see... 2 times 4 is 8!

Now, there's this thing called ""order of operations"" that says you gotta do the multiplication before the addition. So, we've got 8 from the multiplication, and now we need to add 5 and 2. That's easy - 5 plus 2 is 7!

So, the answer is... 7 + 8 = 15! Woohoo, I did it! The answer is 15!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

First, I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll do the multiplication parts first.

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Then, I'll add the two products together.

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Hmm, I'm not sure how to do this problem. I know I have to follow some rules, but I don't know what they are. I think I have to do the multiplication first, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 3. That gives me 12.

Next, I have to add 2 to 12. So, 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it my best shot.

Okay, so the first thing I see is 4 * 2, which is 8. Then I see 8 + 5, which is 13. Next, I see 13 + 12, which is 25. Finally, I see 25 - 2 * 3, which is 25 - 6, which is 19.

So, the answer is 19.

I hope that's right!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this...

Okay, I know that when we add numbers, we have to do it in a specific order. Like, if we have 2 apples and we add 3 more apples, we get 5 apples. So, in this question, we have 5 and 3, and we need to add them together.

But then there's this funny symbol called multiplication. I'm not really sure what it does, but I think it makes the numbers bigger. Like, if we have 2 apples and we multiply them by 3, we get 6 apples! That's a lot of apples!

So, in this question, we have 3 * 2, and that means we need to multiply 3 and 2 together. That gives us... *pauses to calculate* ...6!

Now, we need to add 5 and 6 together. That gives us... *pauses to calculate* ...11!

The answer is 11."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it my best shot.

So, the problem is 5 + 2 * 4, right? Well, first I'll add 5 and 2, that's easy, it's 7. Then, I have 7 * 4, which is 28.

So, the answer is 28!

I know, I know, you're thinking, ""But what about PEMDAS?"" Sorry, I don't know what that means. Maybe you can teach me after we finish this problem? ðŸ˜…

The answer is 28. ðŸ˜Š"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?

Okay, let me try my best. I know that when you multiply numbers, you have to do it in a certain order. So, I think I'll start by multiplying 7 and 2, and then multiply 8 and 5. That gives me... (thinking) 14 and 40. Um, I'm not sure what to do next. Can you help me again?

Oh, I think I know! I need to add 14 and 40! That gives me... (thinking) 54!

The answer is 54."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Hi there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 times 3, which is 12. Then, there's a plus sign and a 2. I'm not sure what to do with the 2, so I'll just add it to the 12.

So, 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 multiplication symbol, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 2+5. That gives me 4 x 7 = 28.

Next, I see the addition symbol, so I'll add 12 to 28. That gives me 40.

Finally, I see the subtraction symbol, so I'll subtract 2 times 3 from 40. That gives me 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34.

I hope that's correct! Can someone tell me what this PEMDAS thing is and why it's important?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, but I don't know why. My teacher just told me to do it that way. So, I'll do the multiplication first.

3 * 2 = 6

Now, I add 5 and 6.

5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, so we have 5 and 2, and we need to add them together. That's easy, it's 7!

But wait, there's more! We have 4 multiply 2, that's 8.

So, we add 7 and 8, and we get... 15!

The answer is 15."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

First, I know that when we have multiplication and addition in a problem, we need to do the multiplication first. So, I'll start by multiplying 7 and 2, which gives me 14.

Next, I'll multiply 8 and 5, which gives me 40.

Now, I need to add 14 and 40. When I do that, I get 54.

So, the answer is 54.

The answer is 54."

Oh, you want me to try my best? Okay, let's see...

I think I should start by adding 2 and 5 because it says to do that first. That's 7.

Then, it says to multiply 4 by 7, which is 28.

Next, it says to subtract 2 times 3, which is 6.

So, 28 - 6 is 22.

The answer is 22!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Okay, so we have this math problem: 5+3 * 2.

First, we need to do the multiplication. 3 * 2 is 6.

Now, we need to add 5 and 6. 5 + 6 is 11.

So, the answer is 11.

The answer is 11."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Okay! So, I know that when we do math, we have to follow some rules. One of those rules is that we have to do things in a certain order. It's like following a recipe for your favorite meal. You have to do the steps in the right order or it won't turn out right.

In this problem, we have a few things happening. We have a 5 and a 2, and then we have a multiplication sign. That means we have to multiply the 2 and the 4. So, we do that first.

2 x 4 = 8

Now, we have our answer to the multiplication part, which is 8. But we're not done yet! We still have the 5 left over. So, we add the 5 to the 8.

5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Okay! Let's see...

First, I know that when we have multiplication, we have to do it first. So, I'll do the multiplication parts:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now, I have two numbers left: 14 and 40. I need to add them together, so I'll do that:

14 + 40 = 54

So, the answer is 54!

The answer is 54."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: The problem is 4 * 3+2.

First, I multiply 4 and 3, which gives me 12.

Then, I add 2 to 12, which gives me 14.

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Okay, let's see...

First, we have to do the things inside the parentheses. That's just how it works. So, we have 2+5, which is 7.

Next, we multiply 4 by 7, which is 28.

Then, we have 12 - 2 times 3, which is 12 - 6, which is 6.

Finally, we add 28 and 6, which is 34.

The answer is 34."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, but I don't know why. It just seems like the right thing to do.

So, 3 * 2 = 6

Now, 5 + 6 = 11
