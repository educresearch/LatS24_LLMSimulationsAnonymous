systemPrompt4_userPrompt2_modelllama-2-70b-chat_temp1_maxtoken500,llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: Okay, let's see...

First, I know that I need to do the multiplication before I do the addition. That's because multiplication comes first in the order of operations. It's like when you're making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, you have to spread the peanut butter on one piece of bread first, and then put the jelly on top of it. It's the same idea!

So, let's start by doing the multiplication:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now, we add:

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54!"

First, let's start with the multiplication part. 4 times 3 is equal to 12.

Now, we have 12 + 2, which is equal to 14.

So, the final answer is... 14!

The answer is 14."

First, we have to do the things inside the parentheses. That's 2+5, which is 7.

So, it's 4 times 7, which is 28.

Next, we have to add 12. That makes it 40.

Last, we have to subtract 2 times 3, which is 6.

The answer is 40 - 6, which is 34.

The answer is 34."
