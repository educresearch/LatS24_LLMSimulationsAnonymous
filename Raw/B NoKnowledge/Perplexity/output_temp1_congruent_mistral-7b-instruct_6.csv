Teacher: The rule is to do multiplication before addition (or subtraction). So in your problem, you need to do the multiplication first: 4*3.

Me: So, the first step is 4 multiplied by 3? Let me do that... 4 * 3 = 12. Now, what's next?

I will do this problem by following the rules I have learned so far. Since both multiplication signs appear before the addition sign, let's do the multiplication first.

First, I'll find 7 times 2: 7 * 2 = 14

Next, I'll find 8 times 5: 8 * 5 = 40

Now, I'll do the addition: 14 + 40 = 54

So, The answer is 54."

I'll try to do the problem, but I might need some help or arrange it in a different way.

So, here's what I'll do: I'll multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then, I'll add 2 to that result.

First, I'll do this: 4 x 3 = 12. Now, I'll add 2 to the result: 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is: The answer is 14."
