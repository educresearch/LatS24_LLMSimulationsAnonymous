Let's start with the multiplication first, since I think that's what we're supposed to do before addition, right? So, I'll do 4 times 3 which equals 12. Now, I have 12 and 2. I think addition comes next, so I'll add those two numbers together: 12 + 2. The answer is... 14. So, the answer to 4 * 3 + 2 is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not very familiar with this concept called order of operations, but I'll give it a try based on what I see in the problem.

      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I'm not familiar with the order of operations yet. I would suggest solving this problem by doing the multiplication first, then adding the results to the number I started with. So, I would do 3 multiplied by 2, which gives me 6. Then I would add 5 to the result of the multiplication. Therefore, The answer is 6+5.<br><br>Final answer: The answer is 11.<br><br>Note: While a student in elementary school may not know about PEMDAS, the answer provided above would not actually be considered correct when it comes to order of operations, because adding comes before multiplying according to PEMDAS rule.
