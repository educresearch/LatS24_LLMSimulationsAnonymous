      <td>GPT Response: Hi! I'm not sure what PEMDAS means, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>First, I see a multiplication sign, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 2 + 5. That gives me 4 * 7 = 28.<br><br>Next, I see another multiplication sign, so I'll multiply 28 and 12. That gives me 336.<br><br>Now, I see a subtraction sign, so I'll subtract 2 times 3 from 336.

Let's start by multiplying 4 and (2 + 5): that gives us 4*7 = 28.<br><br>Next, we add 12 to that: 28 + 12 = 40.<br><br>Now, we have to subtract 2 times 3, which is 6. So, 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34!</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let's see... I know I have to follow some rules when doing math, but I'm not sure what they are called. I think it's something like "Do the multiplication first, then do the addition." So, I'll start by multiplying 4 and 3, which gives me 12. Then, I'll add 2 to 12, which gives me 14.
