Then, add the result to 2:

12 + 2 = 14

So, with the order of operations, the answer is 14.

The answer is 14."

So let's start with the part in the parentheses, which is 2 + 5. When we add those together, we get 7.

Now our equation looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, my teacher also mentioned that multiplication should come before addition and subtraction. So let's do the multiplication steps next. We have two multiplication operations: 4 * 7 and 2 * 3. 

First, let's do 4 * 7, which equals 28.
Then, let's do 2 * 3, which equals 6.

Now our equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

Finally, we just have addition and subtraction left. Let's do the addition first: 28 + 12 equals 40.

Then, we subtract 6 from 40, which gives us 34.

The answer is 34."

Doing the operations in this order gives: 8 * 2 = 16.

So, the answer is 16."
