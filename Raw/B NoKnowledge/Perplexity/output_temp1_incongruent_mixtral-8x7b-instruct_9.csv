systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: Oh boy, I don't know much about math but I can sure try to solve this problem! First, I see some numbers inside parentheses, so I'll add those together first: 2 + 5 equals 7. Now my problem looks like this: 4 \* 7 + 12 - 2 \* 3.

Next, I see that there are still some more parentheses with numbers being multiplied, so I'll do those next: 4 \* 7 equals 28 and 2 \* 3 equals 6. Now my problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.

Now, I just need to do addition and subtraction from left to right, so I'll add 28 + 12 first, which gives me 40. Then I'll subtract 6 from 40, and I get 34.

The answer is 34."

But I've heard from my friends that there is a special rule for this called BIDMAS or PEMDAS. According to this rule, we should do the multiplication before the addition.

5 + 3 * 2

First, I'll do the multiplication:
3 * 2 = 6

Now, I'll do the addition:
5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11."
