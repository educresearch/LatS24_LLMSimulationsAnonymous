It sticks to itself first. So, I see two multiplications here: 7 times 2 and 8 times 5. 

First, let's do the 7 times 2, that equals 14. Then, let's do the 8 times 5, that equals 40. 

Now, we have a new friend, addition, in our equation. We just add the results of those two multiplications together. So, 14 plus 40 equals 54. 

The answer is 54."

So I would multiply 4 and 3 to get 12.

Then I would add the result to 2. Doing this gives me 12 + 2 which equals 14.

So the answer is 14.

The answer is 14."

First, I would add 2 and 5, which equals 7. 

Then, the equation looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I would do the multiplication. I know that you do multiplication before addition, but I'm not sure if there's a special name for it yet. Anyway, I would multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28, and 2 by 3, which equals 6.

Then, the equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

Finally, I would do the addition and subtraction from left to right. I would add 28 and 12, which equals 40, and then subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34.

The answer is 34."
