mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Okay, as a 6th grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first do the addition and subtraction inside the parentheses, then multiply and divide from left to right.

So, I would first add 2 + 5 to get 7, and then multiply that by 4 to get 28. After that, I would subtract 2 from 12 to get 10, and then multiply 2 by 3 to get 6. Finally, I would add 28 and 10 to get 38, and then subtract 6 from that to get 32.

The answer is 32."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: As a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the easiest operation, which is addition. But I remember my teacher telling me that sometimes, we need to follow a specific order to get the correct answer.

Hmm, I think I should ask my teacher about this problem. Or maybe I can try to figure it out myself. I remember something about multiplying before adding... but let me see.

Okay, if I add 5 and 3 first, I get 8, and then multiply that by 2, I get 16. But if I multiply 3 and 2 first, I get 6, and then add 5, I get 11. Wait, I remember now! We should do the operations in this order: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). That's PEMDAS!

Following PEMDAS, I should multiply 3 and 2 first, and then add 5.

So, the answer is 11."

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Well, I'm a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS). But I know how to do multiplication and addition. So, let's solve this step by step.

First, I'll do the multiplication: 7 times 2 equals 14, and 8 times 5 equals 40.

Now, I have two numbers, 14 and 40. I'll add them together: 14 plus 40 equals 54.

The answer is 54."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm a student in grade 6 and I don't know about order of operations (PEMDAS) in Mathematics. But I know that multiplication is just repeated addition. So, when I see ""4 \* 3"", I think of it as 4 added to itself 3 times, which equals 12.

Then, I see ""12 + 2"". I know that 12 added to 2 is 14.

So, the answer is 14.

The answer is 14."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Hello, I'm a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS) yet. When I see a math problem like 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3, I don't know that I should follow a specific order to solve it.

So, I would just solve it from left to right. First, I would do the operation inside the parentheses, which is adding 2 + 5 to get 7. Next, I would multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. Then, I would add 12 to get 40. Finally, I would multiply 2 by 3 to get 6 and then subtract it from 40, which gives me 34.

The answer is 34."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the addition and multiplication from left to right. So I would do 5 + 3 first, which equals 8. Then I would do 8 * 2, which equals 16. But I've noticed that my answer is different when I let someone else, who knows about order of operations, solve the same problem.

So, I learned that there is a specific order to follow in mathematical expressions that involve more than one operation. The order is PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Using PEMDAS, I should've done the multiplication first, then the addition: 3 * 2 = 6, then 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: I don't know about any special order of operations, so I will just do the operations from left to right. I would first add 5 and 2, which gives me 7. Then I will multiply that result by 4, which gives me 28.

The answer is 28."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first remember that addition and multiplication are both basic operations I learn about. However, I'm not sure which one to do first. So, to be safe, I might ask my teacher or a trusted adult for help.

But, if I have to guess, I would start by doing the multiplication since it seems more important because it's closer to the operation symbol ""+"" for addition. I would calculate 7 times 2 first, then 8 times 5.

7 times 2 is 14.
8 times 5 is 40.

Then, I would add the two results together.

14 plus 40 is 54.

Therefore, the answer is 54."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: If I was given the math problem 4 x 3 + 2 without knowing about the order of operations, I would first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12, then add 2 to get 14. This is because when I'm in elementary school, I haven't learned about the order of operations yet, so I would just do the operations from left to right.

The answer is 14."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: I don't know about order of operations yet, but I can still try to solve this problem. I will do the operations from left to right.

First, I will do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.

Now my problem looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I will do the multiplication: 4 * 7 equals 28 and 2 * 3 equals 6.

So now my problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

I will do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 equals 40 and 40 - 6 equals 34.

The answer is 34."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: I don't know about any order of operations rule, so I will just do the operations from left to right. First, I will add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then I will multiply 8 by 2 to get 16. So,

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I would first think of doing the addition and then the multiplication. But I remember my teacher saying something about a special way to follow the operations. I'm not sure yet, but for now, I will follow what I know and do it step by step.

First, I will do the addition: 5 + 2 = 7.
Then, I will do the multiplication: 7 * 4 = 28.

So, even without knowing about the order of operations, my answer is 28. But I think I should ask my teacher about this order of operations thing to make sure.

The answer is 28."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Well, I don't know much about complicated math rules, but I know that if there's an operation right next to a number, we should do that operation first. So let's break it down:

For 7*2, even I know that's 14.
For 8*5, that equals 40.

Now, our original question looks like this: 14 + 40

Adding those two numbers gives us 54.

The answer is 54."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I will solve this by doing the operations from left to right.

First, I will multiply 4 and 3 which equals 12.
Then, I will add the result to 2.
So, 12 + 2 equals 14.

The answer is 14."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: I don't know about order of operations, so I will add, subtract, multiply, and divide from left to right. 

First, I will add 2 and 5 to get 7. 
Then, I will multiply that result by 4 to get 28.
Next, I will add 12 to that result to get 40.
Finally, I will multiply 2 by 3 to get 6, and then subtract that result from the previous sum to get 34.

The answer is 34."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I would first think of doing the addition part because that's what I learned first. But I remember my teacher telling me that there's a rule called ""order of operations"" that tells us what to do first when there are different operations in a problem.

First, we do the multiplication because it comes before addition based on the order of operations rule. So I would multiply 3 and 2 to get 6. Now, our problem looks like this: 5 + 6.

Finally, I would add 5 and 6 to get 11.

The answer is 11."
