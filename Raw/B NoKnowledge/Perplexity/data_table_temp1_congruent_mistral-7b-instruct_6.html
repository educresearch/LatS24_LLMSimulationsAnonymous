      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what those funny letters mean in the acronym PEMDAS, but I've heard adults talking about it when it comes to math problems with several operations. Since there are both multiplication and addition in this problem, I'd better ask for help. I'll ask my teacher to explain the rule for this.<br><br>[Asking the teacher]<br><br>Teacher: The rule is to do multiplication before addition (or subtraction). So in your problem, you need to do the multiplication first: 4*3.<br><br>Me: So, the first step is 4 multiplied by 3? Let me do that... 4 * 3 = 12. Now, what's next?<br><br>Teacher: The multiplication is done. So now you do the addition: 12 + 2.<br><br>Me: Alright, let me add 2 to 12... 12 + 2 = 14.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just a 6th grader and I haven't learned about those fancy rules for math yet, like PEMDAS or anything. But I can still try to solve the problem! Let's do the multiplication first, because that's what my mom told me to do when I have numbers with a "*" sign between them. So, 4 times 3 equals 12. Now, I've got 12 and a "+" sign, so I think maybe I add the numbers? But wait, what if I have to do the 2 first because it's also a number? Let me try that. If I do the 2 first, then I'd have 1+2 which is 3. But if I keep the 12, then I add 2 to it, and the answer is 14. Am I doing it right? The answer is: 14. But maybe I should ask my teacher to make sure! The answer is: 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, this question has numbers and symbols, so I guess we're doing some math! But I don't know about something called order of operations, PEMDAS, or whatever that is.

Let's try it out in a simple way that makes sense to me:<br><br>First, I'll do the multiplication since there are two numbers and an asterisk (*) sign, which I remember from my stories that it means "multiply." So, I do 2 multiplied by 4: that's 2*4 = 8.<br><br>Now I have 5 and an addition (+) sign with the number 8.
