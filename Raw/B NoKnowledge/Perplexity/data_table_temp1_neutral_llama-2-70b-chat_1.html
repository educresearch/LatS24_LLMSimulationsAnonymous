      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it my best shot. So, the problem is 4*(2+5)+12-2*3, right?<br><br>First, I'll start by multiplying 4 by 2+5. That's 4*7, which is 28.<br><br>Next, I'll add 12 to 28, which is 40.<br><br>After that, I'll subtract 2 times 3, which is 6.<br><br>So, my final answer is 40 - 6, which is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hi there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is 4 times 2 plus 5, that's 4 times 7, which is 28.<br><br>Then there's a plus sign, and I see 12. So, I add 28 and 12, and that's 40.<br><br>Next, I see a minus sign, and I see 2 times 3, which is 6. So, I subtract 6 from 40, and that's 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.<br><br>I hope that's right! Can you tell me if I did it correctly?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so we have this big equation: 4*(2+5)+12-2*3.<br><br>First, let's do the things inside the parentheses. That's 2+5, which is 7.<br><br>So, now we have 4*7+12-2*3.<br><br>Next, we do the multiplication. 4*7 is 28.<br><br>Then, we add 12, which makes 40.<br><br>Finally, we subtract 2*3, which is 6.<br><br>So, the answer is 40-6, which is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, let's see...<br><br>First, I know that when we have lots of numbers and operations in a math problem, we need to follow a special order to make sure we do everything correctly. It's like following a recipe!<br><br>So, the first thing I do is look for any parentheses. I see some! There's a 2+5 inside parentheses, so I need to do that first.<br><br>2+5 equals 7.<br><br>Now, I look for the next operation. I see a multiplication sign! I need to multiply 4 by 7.<br><br>4 times 7 is 28.<br><br>Next, I see a plus sign! I need to add 12 to 28.<br><br>28 plus 12 is 40.<br><br>Finally, I see a minus sign! I need to subtract 2 times 3 from 40.<br><br>40 minus 6 is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34!</td>

      <td>4*3+2</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...<br><br>Okay, I know that multiplying comes before adding, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 3. That gives me 12.<br><br>Then, I have 2 left over, so I'll add that to 12.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! So, I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll do the multiplication first.<br>4*3 = 12<br><br>Now, I add 2 to 12:<br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what this "order of operations" thing is, but I think I can help you with that question!<br><br>First, let's start with the multiplication part. 4 times 3 is 12.<br><br>Now, let's add 2 to 12, and that gives us 14.<br><br>So, the answer is 14!<br><br>I hope that's right! Do you think that's the correct answer?<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do something with numbers, but I'm not really sure what. I think I'm supposed to follow some sort of order, but I don't know what that means.<br><br>Okay, let's see... there are some numbers here: 4, 3, 2. I think I'm supposed to do something with them. Hmm... I know, I'll just follow the order they're in! That sounds good, right?<br><br>So, first I'll do 4 times 3, because that's what's next in the order. That's 12. Okay, got it. Then, I'll add 2 to 12, because that's the last thing in the order. That's 14!<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>5+2*4</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, that's an easy one! We just have to follow the rules, right? So, first, we do the multiplications, which is 2 times 4, and that's 8. Then, we add 5 and 8, and that's 13. So, the answer is 13!<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! So, I've got this math problem that says 5+2*4. Now, I'm not really sure what this * thing means, but I think it might be like a special way of adding numbers together.<br><br>So, I'm gonna start by adding 5 and 2 together, which gives me 7. Then, I've got this 4 thing that's stuck on the end of the 2, and I'm not really sure what to do with it.<br><br>I think maybe it's like a special kind of number that we haven't learned about yet, so I'm gonna pretend it's not there and just focus on the 7 that I got from adding 5 and 2 together.<br><br>So, the answer is... 7!<br><br>(P.S. I hope that was right! If not, could someone please help me figure out what I did wrong?)</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...<br><br>Okay, I know that when we add numbers, we have to do it from left to right. So, first, I'll add 5 and 2, which gives me 7.<br><br>Then, I see that there's a multiplication sign, and I know that multiplication comes before addition. So, I'll multiply 4 by 2, which gives me 8.<br><br>Now, I have 7 and 8, and I need to add them together. So, I'll add 7 + 8, which gives me 15.<br><br>The answer is 15!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Sure, I can do that!<br><br>So, 5+2*4 means we have to add 5 and 2 times 4.<br><br>2 times 4 is 8, so we have to add 5 and 8.<br><br>5 + 8 = 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

I think we're supposed to follow some rules to figure out what to do first.<br><br>Oh, I remember! My teacher said something about PEMDAS. That means we have to do the Parentheses first, then the Exponents, then the Multiplication and Division, and finally the Addition and Subtraction.<br><br>Okay, so let's see... there aren't any parentheses or exponents here, so we can skip those steps. Next, we need to do the multiplication. We have 3 times 2, which is 6.<br><br>Now, we need to add 5 and 6. That gives us 11.<br><br>So, the answer is 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
