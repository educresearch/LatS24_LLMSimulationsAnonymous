Okay, I know that when we add numbers, we have to do it in a specific order. So, I think we should start by adding 5 and 2 together. That gives us 7.

Next, we have to multiply 4 by something. I'm not sure what we're supposed to multiply 4 by, but I think it's 7. So, if we multiply 7 by 4, we get 28.

Therefore, the answer is 28.

Okay, so I see some numbers and operations here. Let's start with the multiplication. I know that's the one where you have to multiply numbers together. So, I'll do the 7 * 2 first. That's 14.

Then, I see the plus sign. I'm not sure what that means, but I think it means you have to add something. So, I'll add 14 + 8. That's 22.

Now, there's another multiplication sign. I'll do that next. 8 * 5 is 40.

Wait, what do I do now? I don't know what this PEMDAS thing is. I think I need to add something else. Um... let's see... oh yeah! I have to add 40 + 22. That's... um... carry the 1... add the 2... oh, I don't know! Is it 62?

The answer is 62.

(Note: The correct answer using PEMDAS would be 28. The steps would be: 1) Multiply 7 and 2: 7 × 2 = 14; 2) Multiply 8 and 5: 8 × 5 = 40; 3) Add 14 and 40: 14 + 40 = 28.)"

Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 multiplied by something. I don't know what that something is yet, but I'll come back to it.

Next, I see some addition happening. There's a 2 and a 5, and they're being added together. That's easy, so I'll just do that real quick.

2 + 5 = 7

Cool, now I have my answer for that part. But wait, there's more! There's a 12 and a -2. I don't know what to do with the -2 yet, so I'll just ignore it for now.

12 - 2 = 10

Okay, now I have my answer for that part too. But what about that 4 multiplied by something? I still don't know what that something is!

Oh, I get it! The something is the 7 that I got from the addition part!

4 * 7 = 28

Wow, that's a big number! But wait, there's still that -2. What do I do with that?

Oh right, I subtract it from the 28.

28 - 2 = 26

First, I know that when we have multiplication, we have to do it first. So, I'll start by multiplying 7 and 2. That gives me... (pauses to calculate) 14!

Next, I'll multiply 8 and 5. That gives me... (pauses to calculate) 40!

Now, I have two numbers: 14 and 40. I need to add them together. So, I'll add 14 and 40, and that gives me... (pauses to calculate) 54!

So, the answer is 54!"

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelllama-2-70b-chat_temp1_maxtoken500,llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm just a regular elementary school student, and I'm not sure what this ""order of operations"" thing is all about. But I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

Okay, so I see a bunch of numbers and symbols here. Let's start with the multiplication symbol, which looks like a big cross. I know that means we have to multiply two numbers together. So, I'll multiply 4 and 2, and that gives me 8.

Next, I see a plus sign, which means I have to add two numbers together. I'll add 5 and 2, and that gives me 7.

Oh, wait! There's another plus sign! That means I have to add another number to the one I just got. So, I'll add 12 to 7, and that gives me 19.

But wait, there's a minus sign here too! That means I have to subtract one number from another. I'll subtract 2 times 3, which is 6, from 19. That gives me 13.

So, the final answer is 13!

The answer is 13."
