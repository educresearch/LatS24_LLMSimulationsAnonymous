      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it my best shot.<br><br>Well, the first thing I see is the 4 and the parentheses, so I think I should do that first. Inside the parentheses, there's a 2 and a 5, so I'll add those together. That gives me 7.<br><br>Next, I see the 12, so I'll add that to the 7. That gives me 19.<br><br>Now, there's a minus sign and a 2 and a 3. I'm not sure what to do with those, but I think I should subtract 2 times 3 from 19. That gives me 16.<br><br>The answer is 16.<br><br>I hope that's right! Can you tell me if I did it correctly?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?<br><br>Okay, I think I know how to do the first part. 4 times 2 is 8, and 4 times 5 is 20. So, 4*(2 + 5) is 8 + 20, which is 28.<br><br>Now, I'm not sure what to do next. Can you remind me what PEMDAS stands for?<br><br>Oh, I see! PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction.<br><br>So, I need to do the multiplication and division part first. 12 - 2*3 is 12 - 6, which is 6.<br><br>Now, I need to add 6 and 28. 6 + 28 is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>Okay, so I see a 4 and a 2 + 5 inside some parentheses. I think I should do the addition inside the parentheses first, so that's 2 + 5 = 7.<br><br>Then, I see a 12 and a -2*3. I'm not sure what to do with the multiplication sign, but I think I should do the multiplication before the subtraction. So, -2*3 is -6.<br><br>Now, I have 4*7 + 12 - 6. I'm not sure what to do next, but I think I should do the multiplication first. So, 4*7 is... umm... 28?<br><br>Finally, I have 28 + 12 - 6. Let's see... 28 + 12 is 40, and 40 - 6 is... 34!<br><br>The answer is 34!<br><br>(And by the way, PEMDAS stands for "Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction." Maybe that will help you solve the problem next time!)</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! Let's see...<br><br>First, we have to do the stuff inside the parentheses. That's 2 + 5, which is 7.<br><br>So, now we have 4*7. That's 28.<br><br>Next, we have 12.<br><br>Then, we have 2*3, which is 6.<br><br>Finally, we subtract 6 from 28, and that gives us...<br><br>The answer is 22!</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm just a grade 6 student, and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll try my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is the 5. That's a pretty easy number, so I'll start with that. The answer is 5.<br><br>Next, I see the 2*4. I'm not sure what that means, but I think it's asking me to multiply 2 and 4. So, I'll do that. 2 x 4 = 8.<br><br>Now, I'm not sure what to do next. I see a plus sign, but I don't know what that means. I think it's asking me to add something, but I'm not sure what. Can you help me out here?<br><br>Oh, you want me to add the 5 and the 8? Sure, I can do that! 5 + 8 = 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.<br><br>I hope that's right! Do you think I did a good job solving this math problem? Can you teach me more about this PEMDAS thing?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?<br><br>Oh, you want me to try? Okay, let me see... Um, I think I need to add 5 and 2 first, so that's 7. Then, I need to multiply 4 by 2, which is 8. So, the answer is 7 + 8, which is 15. Wait, no, that can't be right. Um... Okay, I think I need to multiply 2 and 4 first, so that's 8. Then, I add 5 and 8, which is 13. Is that right?<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. I think it has something to do with the order you do math problems in, but I'm not sure what that order is.<br><br>I think I would start by adding 5 and 2, which gets me 7.<br><br>Then, I would multiply 2 by 4, which gets me 8.<br><br>So, my final answer would be 7 + 8, which is 15.<br><br>The answer is 15.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I know that when you have a bunch of numbers and symbols in a math problem, you have to follow some special rules to make sure you do the right operations in the right order. That's called the "order of operations."<br><br>So, in this problem, 5 + 2*4, I know that first I have to do the multiplication because it comes first in the order of operations. I have to multiply 2 by 4, which gives me 8.<br><br>Then, I have to add 5 to 8, which gives me 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, wow! That's a tricky question! Let me think about it for a moment. Okay, so I know that when you have addition and multiplication in a problem, you have to do the multiplication first. That's just the way it works! So, if we do the multiplication, 3*2 is equal to 6. Now, we add 5 and 6, and that gives us 11! The answer is 11. ðŸ˜Š</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hi there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>Okay, so the problem is 5 + 3*2. I know that 3*2 is 6, so I can write that down. Then, I have 5 + 6, which is 11.<br><br>So, the answer is 11.<br><br>I hope that's correct! Can you tell me if I did it right?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, first I would start by adding 5 and 3, which gives me 8. Then, I would multiply 3 by 2, which gives me 6. So, the final answer is 8 + 6, which is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so we have a problem that looks like this: 5 + 3*2.<br><br>First, we need to do the multiplication. 3 times 2 is 6.<br><br>So, now we have 5 + 6.<br><br>Next, we add 5 and 6, and we get 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think... So, we have two numbers being multiplied, 7 and 2, and then another two numbers being multiplied, 8 and 5. I know we have to follow some rules when we do math, but I'm not really sure what they are.<br><br>I think we should do the multiplication first, so let's do 7*2 = 14. Then, we have 8*5 = 40.<br><br>Next, we have to add the two results together, so 14 + 40 = 54.<br><br>So, the answer is 54.<br><br>The answer is __54__.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, this looks like a fun math problem! Let's see...<br><br>First, I know that 7*2 is 14. My teacher showed us that trick a few days ago.<br><br>Then, 8*5 is... hmm... 8 times 5 is 40!<br><br>So, if we add 14 and 40, we get... let me see... 54!<br><br>The answer is 54. ðŸ˜„</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll do the multiplication parts first.<br><br>7*2 = 14<br>8*5 = 40<br><br>Now, I add 14 and 40 together.<br><br>14 + 40 = 54<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so we have two numbers, 7 and 2, and we need to multiply them together. That's easy, it's like when you have a bunch of cookies and you want to know how many you'll have if you add some more. So, 7 cookies times 2 cookies is equal to... (counting on fingers) 14 cookies!<br><br>But wait, there's more! We have another set of numbers, 8 and 5. We need to multiply them together too. Hmm, 8 cookies times 5 cookies is... (counting on fingers again) 40 cookies!<br><br>Now, we need to add the two products together. 14 cookies + 40 cookies is... (counting on fingers) 54 cookies!<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
