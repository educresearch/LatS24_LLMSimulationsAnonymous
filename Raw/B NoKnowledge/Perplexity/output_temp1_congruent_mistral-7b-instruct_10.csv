So, I'll start by doing 7 multiplied by 2, which equals 14. Then, I'll do 8 multiplied by 5, which equals 40. Lastly, I'll add these two numbers together, so the answer is:

The answer is 54."

I think I need to follow some rules to solve this problem. Let's do the multiplication first because the asterisk (*) symbol means multiplication. So, 4 times 3 gives us 12. Now, I have 12 and the addition symbol (+). I remember, when you have addition and subtraction signs, I should do it from left to right. So, I will add 12 and 2.

The answer is 14."

But I don't know what to do because I've never heard about order of operations! Let's try to figure it out as best as I can.

First, I think, maybe we should do the multiplication part first because there's a ""*"" sign, so 3 multiplied by 2 is 6. Then I have 5 plus 6, which makes 11.

So, here's what I think: if I do the multiplication first, the answer would be 11.

The answer is __11__. (Let's see if big kids or teachers agree with my answer!)"
