mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Okay, so I don't know about this order of operations thing, but I'll just do the math from left to right. 

First, I'll add 2 and 5 inside the parentheses, which gives me 7. 

So now it looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I'll do the multiplication, so 4 times 7 is 28, and 2 times 3 is 6.

So now it looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

Finally, I'll do addition and subtraction from left to right. So 28 plus 12 is 40, and then 40 minus 6 is 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Okay, so I don't know about any order of operations rules, I'll just solve this step by step.

First, let's do the operations inside the parentheses:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I'll do the multiplications:

28 + 12 - 6

Now, I'll do the addition:

40 - 6

Finally, I'll do the subtraction:

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I would follow the numbers and operations in the order they appear. At first, I would add 2 + 5 to get 7. Then, I would multiply 4 by 7 to get 28, and add 12 to get 40. After that, I would multiply 2 by 3 to get 6, and subtract it from 40. The answer is 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: I don't know about order of operations, so I'll just do the operations from left to right. First, I'll do the multiplication, then the addition, then the subtraction, and finally the multiplication again.

4 \* (2 + 5) = 4 \* 7 = 28

28 + 12 - 2 \* 3 = 28 + 12 - 6

Now, I'll continue from left to right.

28 + 12 = 40 and 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the multiplication and addition from left to right. So I would first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then I would add 2 to get 14. Therefore, the answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will just solve this problem from left to right.

First, I will multiply 4 and 3, which gives me 12.
Then, I will add the result to 2.
So, 12 + 2 equals 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: If I were given the math problem 4 x 3 + 2 as a student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first remember that multiplication is something I learned before addition, so I would do that part first. 4 x 3 equals 12. Then, I would add 2 to that result, so 12 + 2 equals 14. Therefore, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations, I would first think of doing the operation that I learned how to do first, which is multiplication. So I would multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then I would see there is still another operation, which is addition, so I would add 2 to 12. When I do that, I get 14.

The answer is 14."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the addition and multiplication from left to right. So I would add 5 and 2 to get 7, then multiply that result by 4.

Doing this gives me 7 * 4 = 28.

However, I just learned that there is a rule in Mathematics called the order of operations, or PEMDAS, that tells us we should actually do the multiplication before the addition.

So, using the order of operations, I should first multiply 2 and 4 to get 8, then add that result to 5.

Doing this gives me 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: Well, as a 6th grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think that I can just solve this problem from left to right. So I would add 5 and 2 to get 7, and then multiply that by 4.

So, I would do 7 (which is 5+2) times 4, and get 28.

Therefore, the answer is 28.","GPT Response: I don't know about any order of operations or PEMDAS, so I will just solve this from left to right. 

First, I will add 5 and 2 to get 7. 
Then, I will multiply that 7 by 4 to get 28.

So, the answer is 28.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I would first think of doing the addition and multiplication from left to right. So I would first add 5 and 2 to get 7, and then multiply that result by 4. Doing this, I get 28. But that's not the correct answer.

It's important to know that in mathematics, there is a specific order in which operations should be done, even when they're written without parentheses. This order is: first any operations inside parentheses, then exponents, then multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.

So in this problem, even though I would do the addition before the multiplication if I just went from left to right, the correct order is to do the multiplication first. That means I should multiply 2 by 4 to get 8, and then add 5 to get 13.

The answer is 13."

So, I would add 5 and 3 to get 8, and then multiply that result by 2.

8 * 2 = 16

Therefore, the answer is 16.","GPT Response: As a 6th grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would start by doing the addition first because that's what I would do normally.

So, I would add 5 and 3 to get 8.
Then I would multiply that result by 2.

8 times 2 equals 16.

Therefore, the answer is 16.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think about adding 5 and 3 to get 8. Then, I would multiply 3 (the result from the previous addition) by 2. I would get 6 as the final answer.

The answer is 6.","GPT Response: Well, I don't really know much about order of operations because I'm just a student in elementary school. But for this problem, I would add 5 and 3 first to get 8, then multiply that result by 2. So the answer is 16.

So, I would first multiply 7 by 2 which equals 14. Then, I would multiply 8 by 5 which equals 40. Finally, I would add the results of the two multiplications, 14 and 40, together to get 54.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will just solve this expression step by step based on how it is written.

First, I will do the multiplication:
7 (from 7*2) times 2 equals 14
8 (from 8*5) times 5 equals 40

Now, I have two results: 14 and 40. I will proceed by doing addition:
14 plus 40 equals 54

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: I don't know about any order of operations rule, but I know that multiplication means to multiply numbers together. So, if I see a problem with multiplication and addition, I should do the multiplication first.

For this question, 7 times 2 is 14 and 8 times 5 is 40. Then, I add those results together.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Well, I don't know much about order of operations, but I remember my teacher saying something about ""PEMDAS"" which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Looking at our problem, there aren't any parentheses or exponents. But there is multiplication and addition. So according to PEMDAS, I should do the multiplication first, then the addition.

First, let's do 7 times 2. That equals 14.
Then, let's do 8 times 5. That equals 40.
Now, add those two results together: 14 + 40 equals 54.

The answer is 54."
