First, according to the sandwich rules, we do anything inside the parentheses first. But, in this case, there are no parentheses. So, I guess the next rule is to do any exponents. There aren't any exponents either, though. I think I should do multiplication and division from left to right.

First, I think we should do the multiplication part, since we usually do that before addition or subtraction. So, let's do 4 times 3: that makes 12.

Now, we have 12 and the addition symbol + and the number 2. Hmmm... Let me think... Maybe we should add 2 to 12? But what about the + sign? Well, my teacher said that sometimes we have to be careful with the order of doing things, like in a recipe or when building blocks, so maybe we need to follow some rules here. Let's try adding 2 first, and then multiplying 12 by the result. That would be 12 + 2, which makes 14. Now we have 14 and the multiplication symbol ×. But I'm not sure if that's what we should do. Maybe I should ask my teacher for help?

However, my teacher isn't here, so let me try it one more way. My teacher also said that sometimes there's a special order that we follow when we do math, like taking an apple out of a basket and then eating it, not the other way around. Maybe there's a special order for this problem too! I've heard people call it the order of operations or something like that. Let me try to remember what those rules are...

Okay, here are the rules I think I remember: We do the things inside the parentheses first, then we do the exponents (if there are any), followed by multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally we do addition and subtraction (from left to right). Let's see if this helps!

Following these rules, I think we should do the multiplication first. So that's 4 times 3, which is 12 as we figured out earlier. Now, the problem doesn't have any parentheses or exponents, so the next step is to do the addition. So that's 12 plus 2, which makes 14.

The answer is 14."

But I've not encountered the order of operations symbol (BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEMDAS) yet. Let's solve 4*(2+5)+12-2*3 step by step.

First, we follow the rule of when to use parentheses: we solve the expression inside the parentheses first.

So, we begin with: (2+5), which equals 7.

Now, replace the parentheses with the number 7: 4*7+12-2*3

Next, we do the multiplication: 4*7=28 and 2*3=6.

Now we replace the multiplication signs with the multiplication results: 28+12-6.

We can see that there's no more parentheses or multiplication left to do, so we start addition and subtraction from left to right: 28+12=30 and 30-6=24.

The answer is: The answer is 24."
