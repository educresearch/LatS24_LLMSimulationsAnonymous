I would first add the numbers I see at the very beginning, then I would do the multiplication. So, I would do 5 + 3, which gives me 8. Then I would do the multiplication, which is 3 times 2, which equals 6. So, I would have to do the addition part again because I made a mistake by doing multiplication after addition, but this time I would do it correctly by performing the multiplication first, which is 3 times 2 equals 6. Then I add the result of the multiplication to the initial sum, so 5 + 3 equals 8, and then 8 plus 6 gives the final answer.\n\nThe answer is: 14.\n\n(Note: As a reminder, the correct order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS or parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction, should have been followed to get the correct answer: 5 + (3 * 2) = 5 + 6 = 11.)"}]}]
