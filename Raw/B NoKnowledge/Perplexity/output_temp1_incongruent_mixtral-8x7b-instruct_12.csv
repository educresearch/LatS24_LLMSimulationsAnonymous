systemPrompt4_userPrompt2_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: Well, I don't know much about order of operations, but I remember my teacher saying something about a rule called PEMDAS. I think it stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this question, there are no parentheses or exponents, so I should start with multiplication and division from left to right. 

First, I'll do 7 times 2, which equals 14. Then, I'll do 8 times 5, which equals 40. But I're not done yet because there's still addition involved!

So, I'll add the results of the two multiplications together: 14 plus 40 equals 54. 

The answer is 54."

However, I remember my teacher mentioning something called ""order of operations"" or ""BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEDMAS"" which says that we should do the operations in the following order: Brackets/parentheses, Indices/Orders/Exponents, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this question, there are no brackets, indices, or division. But there is multiplication and addition. So, following the order of operations, I should do the multiplication first and then the addition.

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14."

So, I would add 2 + 5 to get 7. Then, the problem becomes: 4 \* 7 + 12 - 2 \* 3.

Next, I would do the multiplication. I would multiply 4 \* 7 to get 28, and 2 \* 3 to get 6. Then, the problem becomes: 28 + 12 - 6.

Finally, I would add and subtract from left to right. So, I would add 28 + 12 to get 40, and then subtract 6 from 40 to get 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34."
