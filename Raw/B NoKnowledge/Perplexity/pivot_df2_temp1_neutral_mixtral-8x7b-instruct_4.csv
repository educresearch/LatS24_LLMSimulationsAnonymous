mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Okay, so I don't know about this order of operations thing, but I'll just do the math from left to right.

First, I'll do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.

Next, I'll multiply 4 by 7, since that's the first operation I see: 4 times 7 equals 28.

Then, I'll do the subtraction: 28 minus 12 equals 16.

Finally, I'll do the last multiplication: 16 times 3 equals 48.

The answer is 48.","GPT Response: Hi, I'm a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS). So, I'll just solve this step by step, following the basic order of doing math operations from left to right.

First, let's do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.

Now, our equation looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we'll do the multiplication: 4 * 7 equals 28 and 2 * 3 equals 6.

Now, our equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, we do addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 6 equals 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: I would start by doing the operations in parentheses first, that's the ""P"" in PEMDAS. So I would add 2 and 5 to get 7.

Then I would do the multiplication, that's the ""M"" in PEMDAS. So I would multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. Then I would multiply 2 by 3 to get 6.

Next, I would do the addition and subtraction, that's the ""A"" and ""S"" in PEMDAS. So I would add 28 and 12 to get 40. Then I would subtract 6 from 40 to get 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: I don't know about any special rules for solving math problems, so I'll just do the operations in the order they appear, from left to right. This is sometimes called ""straight line"" or ""front-to-back"" math.

First, I'll do the multiplication: 4 times 2 equals 8, and 4 times 5 equals 20, so the problem becomes:

8 + 20 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I'll do the addition: 8 plus 20 equals 28, so the problem becomes:

28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Then, I'll do the subtraction: 28 minus 12 equals 16, so the problem becomes:

16 - 2 * 3

Next, I'll do the remaining multiplication: 2 times 3 equals 6, so the problem becomes:

16 - 6

Finally, I'll do the remaining subtraction: 16 minus 6 equals 10.

The answer is 10."

Then, I'll do the addition.
The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Hmm, this looks like a fun puzzle! I'm not sure about any special rules, so I'll just solve it step by step.

First, I'll do the multiplication because that's what I see first: 4 times 3 equals 12.

Next, I see there's an addition sign, so I'll add 2 to the result of the multiplication: 12 plus 2 equals 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I would first guess that the answer is 14 because I would do the multiplication and addition from left to right. But I know that's not right because I heard about something called ""order of operations"" that helps you do the operations in the right order. I'm not sure what it is yet, but I know that if I follow it, the answer is 12.

So, The answer is 12."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think that I can just solve this problem from left to right. So I would add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then I would multiply that result by 4. Doing this, I get 28. But I remember my teacher mentioning something about a correct order to do the operations. I'm not sure, but I think for this problem, I should have done the multiplication first (followed by addition). If I had done that, I would have gotten 2 (since 2*4 is 8, and 5+8 is 13). So I made a mistake by not following the order of operations. The answer is 13.","GPT Response: As a sixth-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will simply solve this step by step based on how I was probably taught at this grade level.

First, I would do the addition because that's what I see first:

Then I would multiply that result by 4:

7 * 4 = 28

So, the answer is:

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: I don't know about order of operations like PEMDAS yet, but I know that doing multiplication first is a good rule. So I would do 2 times 4 first to get 8. Then I would add that result to 5 to get 13. The answer is 13.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I would solve this problem step by step based on how I learned so far.

First, I would do the addition since that's what comes first when I look at the problem:

Then, I would do the multiplication because I remember my teacher teaching me that multiplication should come before addition:

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the addition and multiplication from left to right. 

So I would add 5 and 3 to get 8, then multiply that result by 2.

8 * 2 = 16

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the addition and then the multiplication because that's what I've learned so far. But I remember my teacher mentioning something about doing operations in a specific order to get the right answer. I'm not sure what it is yet, but I think it's important.

For this problem, let me first do the addition:

5 + 3 = 8

Then, I'll do the multiplication:

8 \* 2 = 16

So, even though I don't completely understand why, I should follow the order of operations, which I think is PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction). In this case, I only have addition and multiplication, so I do the multiplication first:

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: I don't know about any special rules for doing math, so I will just do the problems from left to right. First, I will add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then, I will multiply 8 by 2 to get 16. So, the answer is 16.

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations, I would first think of doing the addition since that's what I see first. But I remember my teacher telling me that we have to follow certain rules when solving math problems.

So, I try to figure out if there's a rule for this kind of problem. Oh wait! I remember now, we should do the operations in parentheses first, then exponents, then multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally addition and subtraction (from left to right). That's called PEMDAS.

In this problem, there aren't any parentheses or exponents, so I go to the next rule: multiplication. I see that there is a number multiplied by another number: 3*2. I should do that operation first.

3*2 equals 6.

Now, I replace 3*2 with 6, so the problem becomes: 5+6

Then, I just have to add those numbers together:

5+6 equals 11.

The answer is 11."

First, I would multiply 7 by 2, which equals 14. Then, I would multiply 8 by 5, which equals 40. Lastly, I would add those two results together.

For this problem, I see that I only have multiplication:

7 times 2 equals 14, and
8 times 5 equals 40.

So now I have:
