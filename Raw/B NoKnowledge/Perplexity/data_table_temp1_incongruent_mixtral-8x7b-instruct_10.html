      <td>GPT Response: Okay, I'm a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS). So, let's break down this problem step by step.<br><br>First, I'll do the operations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7. Now it looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, since I don't know about the order of operations yet, I'll just do the operations from left to right. I'll do the multiplication first: 4 * 7 equals 28 and 2 * 3 equals 6. Now it looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Lastly, I'll do addition and subtraction from left to right. I'll add 28 and 12, which gives me 40, and then subtract 6 from it.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hi! I'm a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS) yet. When I see a math problem like this: 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3, I would just do the operations from left to right.<br><br>First, I would do the addition inside the parentheses: 4 * (7)+12-2 * 3<br>Then, I would do the multiplication: 28+12-6<br>Lastly, I would do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 40-6 = 34<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

I will start with the operations inside the parentheses.<br><br>4 \* (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 \* 3<br>= 4 \* 7 + 12 - 2 \* 3 (add 2 and 5 inside the parentheses)<br>= 28 + 12 - 2 \* 3 (multiply 4 and 7)<br>= 28 + 12 - 6 (multiply 2 and 3)<br>= 40 - 6 (add 28 and 12)<br>= 34 (subtract 6 from 40)<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I would start with the part of the problem inside the parentheses, since that's where you should start according to my teacher. So, I would add 2 + 5 to get 7. Then, the problem looks like this: 4 \* 7 + 12 - 2 \* 3.<br><br>Next, I would do the multiplication and addition, because multiplication and division come before addition and subtraction. So I would do 4 \* 7 to get 28 and 2 \* 3 to get 6. Then, the problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Finally, I would do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So I would add 28 + 12 to get 40 and then subtract 6 from 40 to get 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

So I would first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12, and then add 2 to get 14. However, I recently learned that there is a rule called PEMDAS that tells us the order in which we should do operations.<br><br>According to PEMDAS, parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right) are the order of operations. So even though I first thought of doing the multiplication and addition from left to right, I should actually do the multiplication first, and then the addition.<br><br>Doing the multiplication first, I get 12 (which is 4 * 3).
