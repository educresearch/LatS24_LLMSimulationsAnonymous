mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: I don't know about any order of operations rule, but I can still try to solve this problem. I would start by doing the operations inside the parentheses first. So, I would add 2 and 5 to get 7. Then, I would have:

4 \* 7 + 12 - 2 \* 3

Next, I would do the multiplication. So, I would multiply 4 by 7 to get 28, and 2 by 3 to get 6. Then, I would have:

28 + 12 - 6

Finally, I would do addition and subtraction from left to right. So, I would add 28 and 12 to get 40, and then subtract 6 from 40 to get:

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Okay, so I don't know about any order of operations or PEMDAS, I just know how to do the operations one by one from left to right. 

First, I will do the operation inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5, that equals to 7.

Then, I will multiply 4 by 7, which gives me 28.

Now, I have 28 plus 12, which is 40.

Then, I will multiply 2 by 3, which is 6.

Finally, I will subtract 6 from 40, which results in 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: I don't know about any special rules for solving math problems, so I will just do the operations from left to right.

First, I will do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.

Next, I will multiply 4 by 7, since that comes next: 4 times 7 equals 28.

Then, I will do the addition on the outside of the parentheses: 28 plus 12 equals 40.

After that, I will do the multiplication: 2 times 3 equals 6.

Finally, I will do the subtraction: 40 minus 6 equals 34.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: As a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the multiplication and addition from left to right. So I would first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12, and then add 2 to get 14. However, I recently learned that there is a rule called PEMDAS that tells us the correct order to solve math problems.

The order of operations is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). In this problem, we have multiplication and addition. According to PEMDAS, we should do the multiplication before the addition.

So, I should first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12, and then add 2 to get 14.

Oh, I remember now! There's this thing called BIDMAS or PEMDAS that tells you which operation to do first. It stands for Brackets/parentheses, Indices/Exponents, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this question, there are no parentheses or exponents. But there is multiplication and addition. So following the order, I should do the multiplication first:

7 times 2 equals 14 and 8 times 5 equals 40. So the problem becomes:

14 + 40

So I would first multiply 7 and 2 to get 14, and then add 8 to get 22. But then if I multiply 8 and 5 to get 40, that's much bigger than 22! So I must be doing something wrong.

I remember my teacher mentioning something about a special order to follow when there are different operations in a math problem. I think it's called PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).
