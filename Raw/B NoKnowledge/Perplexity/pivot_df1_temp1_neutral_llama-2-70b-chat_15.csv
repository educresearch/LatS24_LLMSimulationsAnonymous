llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this...

Okay, I know that when we add numbers, we have to do it from left to right. So, first, I'll add 5 and 2, which gives me 7.

Next, I see that there's a multiplication sign, and I know that multiplication comes before addition. So, I'll multiply 4 by 2, which gives me 8.

Now, I have 7 and 8. I'm not sure what to do next, but I think I should add them together. So, 7 + 8 = 15.

The answer is 15."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Hmm, okay, I'm not sure how to do this problem. I know I need to follow some rules, but I'm not sure what they are. I think I remember something about multiplying coming before adding, but I'm not sure. Let me see...

Okay, I think I'll start by multiplying the 7 and 2. That gives me 14. Then, I'll multiply the 8 and 5, and that gives me 40. Next, I'll add 14 and 40, and that gives me... hmm, let's see... 54!

The answer is 54.

I hope that's right!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to follow some rules when doing math problems, but I don't really know what they are. I think I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, so I'll do that.

4*3 = 12

Now, I'm supposed to add 2 to that, right? So,

12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Okay, I'll give it a try!

First, I see some multiplication, so I'll start with that. The 4 times 2 is 8, and then plus 5 is 13.

Next, I see some addition, so I'll do that next. 12 plus 13 is 25.

Finally, I see some subtraction. 2 times 3 is 6, and then subtracting 6 from 25 gives me 19.

The answer is 19!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Okay, so we have this math problem, 5+3*2. I'm not sure what that star thing means, but I think it's like a special symbol that means we have to do something special with the numbers. So, I'm just gonna do what makes sense to me.

First, I'll add 5 and 3, that's easy, it's 8.

Now, I'm not sure what to do with the 2, so I'll just leave it alone for now.

Oh, wait! I remember something my teacher said about multiplication being like repeated addition. So, I'll just multiply 3 and 2, that's 6.

Now, I have 8 and 6, so I'll add them together, that's 14.

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Hey, I'm just a grade 6 student, and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But let's try to solve this problem together!

Okay, so we have 5 + 2 * 4. I know that 2 * 4 is 8, so we can start by adding 5 and 8. That gives us 13.

The answer is 13.

I hope that's correct! Can you help me understand what PEMDAS means and why it's important in Math?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I've got this problem here, 7*2+8*5. Let's see...

First, I know I have to do the multiplication stuff. So, 7 times 2 is 14. Okay, got that.

Next, I have to do 8 times 5, which is... hang on, let me think... okay, that's 40!

Now, I have to add 14 and 40. Hmm... 14 + 40 is... (counting on my fingers) 54!

The answer is 54! Woohoo, I did it! ðŸ˜„"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not really sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But let's see... 4*3 means 4 groups of 3, which is 12. Then there's this plus sign, and it's telling me to add 2 to 12. So, 12 + 2 = 14. The answer is 14!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not really sure about this thing called ""order of operations"" or PEMDAS. But I'll give it my best shot!

So, the problem is 4*(2+5)+12-2*3, right? I think we should start by adding 2 and 5 together, that's 7. Then we multiply 4 by 7, that's 28. Next, we add 12, that's 40. Finally, we subtract 2 times 3, that's 6.

So, the answer is 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34.

I hope that's correct! Can someone please tell me if I did it right?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+3*2,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you explain it to me?

Oh, you want me to try and solve it anyway? Okay, let me see...

I think I should add 5 and 3 first, that's 8.
Then, I should multiply 8 by 2, that's 16.

The answer is 16.

Is that correct? Did I do it right?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Okay, so we have this problem: 5+2*4. I'm not sure what PEMDAS means, but I think we do the multiplication first because it's like a secret code. So, 2 times 4 is 8. Now, we add 5 and 8, and that's 13! The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?

I see that there are numbers and symbols in the problem, but I'm not sure what to do with them. There's a 7 and a 2, and then a plus sign, and then an 8 and a 5. I know what addition is, but I don't know how to do it with these numbers.

I think I need to learn PEMDAS to solve this problem. Can you teach me what it means and how to use it?

Oh, I see! PEMDAS stands for ""Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction."" That sounds like a lot to remember!

So, let's see... first, we need to do the multiplication. There's a 7 and a 2, so we need to multiply those together. That gives us 14.

Next, we need to do the addition. There's an 8 and a 5, so we need to add those together. That gives us 13.

Finally, we need to add the 14 and the 13 together. That gives us 27!

The answer is 27.

I'm so glad I learned PEMDAS! It's really helpful for solving problems like this. Can I practice using PEMDAS with some more problems?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Okay, so we have a problem that looks like this: 4*3+2. I'm not sure what that means, but I think we're supposed to do the multiplication first. So, 4 times 3 is... (pauses to think) 12!

Now, what's next? Oh yeah, we have a plus sign. That means we have to add something. There's a 2 there, so we'll add that to 12. (pauses to think) 12 + 2 = 14!

So, the answer is 14.

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Oh, wow! That's a big math problem! Let me see...

Okay, first I would do the addition inside the parentheses. That's 2+5, which is 7.

Then, I would multiply 4 by 7, and that's 28.

Next, I would add 12 to 28, and that's 40.

Lastly, I would subtract 2 times 3, which is 6, from 40.

The answer is 34!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Hi! I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?

Okay, so I know that 5 + 3 is 8, and 3 * 2 is 6. But then I'm not sure what to do.

Oh, I know! Let me try this: 8 + 6 = 14!

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Okay, I'll try my best!

So, I know that when we do math, we usually start with the numbers that are inside the parentheses. In this case, there's a 2 inside the parentheses, and it's multiplying another number, 4. So, I think I need to do that multiplication first.

2 x 4 = 8

Now, there's a 5 outside the parentheses, and it's adding something. I'm not sure what it's adding yet, but I'll find out soon!

5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what the order of operations is. Can you tell me what that is?

Oh, you want me to try anyway? Okay, let's see...

I know that 7*2 is 14, and 8*5 is 40.

So, if I add 14 and 40, I get 54.

The answer is 54."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Okay! So, let's see... 4 times 3 is 12, and then we have to add 2 to that. So, 12 + 2 is... ummm... 14! The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Okay, let's see...

First, I know that when we have parentheses, we have to do what's inside them first. So, I'll start by adding 2 and 5, which gives me 7.

Next, I have to multiply 4 by 7, which gives me 28.

Then, I have to add 12 to 28, which gives me 40.

Finally, I have to subtract 2 times 3 from 40, which gives me 37.

The answer is 37."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Okay, let me think... 5 plus 3 is 8, and then we multiply 8 by 2, which is 16. The answer is 16."
