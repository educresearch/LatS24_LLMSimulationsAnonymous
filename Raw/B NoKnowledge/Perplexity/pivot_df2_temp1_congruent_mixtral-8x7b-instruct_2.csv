mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Sure! As a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would solve this problem step by step in the order that the operations appear.

First, I would do the addition inside the parentheses:

4 \* (7) + 12 - 2 \* 3

Next, I would perform multiplication:

28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, I would do addition and subtraction from left to right:

40 - 6 = 34

So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: Hi! I'm a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS) yet. To solve this problem, I will do the operations inside the parentheses first, then multiply and add from left to right. 

First, I'll do 2 + 5, which is 7. The equation now looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I'll do the multiplication. I'll do 4 * 7 first, which is 28. Then I'll do 2 * 3, which is 6. Now the equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, I'll do addition and subtraction from left to right. So I'll add 28 and 12, which is 40. Then I'll subtract 6 from 40, which is 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: I don't know about any special rules like PEMDAS yet, so I'll just do the operations from left to right. First, I'll do the addition and subtraction inside the parentheses:

4 \* 7 + 12 - 2 \* 3

Then, I'll do the multiplication and addition from left to right:

28 + 12 - 6

Next, I'll do more addition and subtraction from left to right:

40 - 6

And finally, I'll do the last subtraction:

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: I don't know about order of operations, so I will solve this by doing the operations from left to right. 

First, I will do the addition inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5, to get 7. 

Then, I will multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. Now, my equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2*3

Next, I will do multiplication, so I will multiply 2 by 3 to get 6. Now, my equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

So,
5 + 2*4 = 5 + 8 = 13 (incorrectly according to the order of operations)

But, using order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we should follow these steps: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So, the correct answer would be:
5 + 2*4 = 5 + 8 = 13 (correctly according to the order of operations)","GPT Response: Well, as a student in elementary school, I would first try to add 5 and 2 to get 7. But then I remember that my teacher taught me about something called Order of Operations, which means we do certain things before others. We first multiply and divide, and then we add and subtract. So for this problem, I should first multiply 2 and 4 to get 8. Then I add the 5, and get 13.

The answer is 13."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the addition since that's what I see first. But I remember my teacher saying that we have to follow a rule for these types of problems.

First, we do any multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction. So for this problem, 5 + 3*2, I should do the multiplication part first, which is 3*2. That equals 6.

Now, I replace 3*2 with 6, so the problem becomes 5 + 6. And finally, I add those numbers to get 11.

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the addition since that's what I learned first. But I remember my teacher mentioning something about multplication being done before addition. So, I should follow that rule.

First, I'll do the multiplication: 3*2 = 6

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about order of operations, I would first think of doing the addition and multiplication from left to right. So I would add 5 and 3 to get 8, and then multiply that by 2 to get 16. But I've just learned that there's something called ""order of operations"" or PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction) that we're supposed to follow when solving math problems. That means I should do the multiplication before the addition. So I would first multiply 3 and 2 to get 6, and then add 5 to get 11.

First, let's do the multiplication:
7 times 2 is 14,
