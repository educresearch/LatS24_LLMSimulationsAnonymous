mistral-7b-instruct,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm not familiar with the order of operations rule called PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction). So, let's solve the expression step by step without those rules:

1. Solve the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7
2. Replace the parentheses with the number 7: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3
3. Perform the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28, 2 * 3 = 6
4. Do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40, 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Well, I'm just a 6th grade student, and I've heard people mention something called order of operations, but I don't really get it. Let's see if we can still figure out this math problem without it.

First, let's do the addition inside the parentheses:

4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3

4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, let's do the multiplication:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Now, let's do the multiplication in the last expression:

4 * 7 + 12 - 6

Lastly, let's do the addition and subtraction from left to right:

30 + 12 - 6

Let's check if we got the correct answer:

30 + 12 = 42
42 - 6 = 36

The answer is 36.","GPT Response: As a young student, I'd follow the simple rules I know for doing addition and multiplication. Here's what I'd do:

First, I'd do the numbers inside the parentheses, because parentheses usually mean I should do those first. So, 2 + 5 equals 7. Then I'd multiply 4 times 7: 4 * 7 = 28. Next, I'd add 12 to the result: 28 + 12 = 40. Finally, I'd subtract 2 from 3 and then multiply that by 2: 2 - 1 = 1, and then 1 * 2 = 2. Lastly, I'd subtract 2 from the final answer: 40 - 2 = 38.

So, the answer is 38.","GPT Response: I don't know about order of operations yet, but I can still try to solve this problem step by step.

First, let's do the calculations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.

Next, I'll do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28.

Then, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40.
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34.

So, the answer is: The answer is 34."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I have not learned about the order of operations yet, so I will do this math problem by following the simple rule of performing multiplication before addition. This means I should do the 4*3 part first.

So, 4*3 equals 12, and then I add 2 to get the final answer:

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I don't know about the order of operations yet. I think we should do the multiplication first, then the addition. So, let's calculate 4*3 = 12, and then add 2 to it. Therefore, The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure about the order of doing things in this math problem. But, let me try to solve it. I'll do the multiplication first, because it looks easier to me. So, I'll find 4 times 3 which equals 12. Then, I'll do the addition. So, I'll add 12 to 2. Voila! The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Well, I see numbers and symbols here. Let's try to make sense of it step by step, just like when we put together Lego blocks. First, I see the multiplication symbol (x) between 4 and 3. So, I will do that part first to get 12. Then, I have 12 and the addition symbol (+) with 2. Now, I add 2 to 12 to get my final answer.

So, the answer is: 12 + 2 = __

(Continuing the process)

12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know about the order of operations in mathematics. But I'll try to guess based on what I see:

First, I'll do the multiplication because there are numbers and a multiplication sign: 2*4 = 8

Then, I'll do the addition: 5 + 8

So, the answer is: The answer is 13.

But, I'm not sure if this is correct because I don't really understand the meaning of order of operations yet. I hope my answer is close to the actual one!","GPT Response: As a 6th grade student, I have not learned about the order of operations yet. So, I will do the calculation based on what I see first.

I see the ""+"" sign between 5 and 2*4. At first, I thought I should do multiplication before addition, but since I have not learned the order of operations, I will just do the addition first.

So, let's do the addition:

5 + 2*4 = 5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: Well, I don't really know about this thing called order of operations, but my teacher said we should do multiplication before addition. So, I guess I should do 2 times 4 first: 2 * 4 = 8. Then I add 5: 5 + 8 = 13. The answer is __13.__","GPT Response: Hmm, this looks like a math problem to me! But I'm just a little student and I don't know the special rules for doing these kinds of calculations yet. I think I'll ask my teacher to help me out next time I'm in class.in the meantime, I'll try to do it in the order I see the symbols, so I'll start with the addition first:

5 + 2*4

Then I'll do the multiplication:

5 + (2*4)

And then the addition:

5 + 8

The answer is __.
13. I'm not sure if that's right, but it's what I came up with! I'll double-check with my teacher when I get the chance. (Answer: 13)"
mistral-7b-instruct,1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure what ""PEMDAS"" means, but my teacher told us to follow some rules when doing math problems. I think we should do multiplication and division before addition and subtraction, right? So, in this case, we have 3 multiplied by 2 which is 6. Then we add 5, so the answer is...

The answer is: 5 + 3*2 = 5 + 6 = 11.","GPT Response: Well, I've got this math problem here: 5 + 3*2. I think I should do the multiplication first since there are numbers and an asterisk (*) there, which usually means multiplication, right? But wait, what if adding 5 to the result of the multiplication would change it? Let's try it out!

So, I'll do the multiplication part: 3 multiplied by 2 equals 6. Now, I add the 5 to the result: 5 + 6.

They are just simple additions now. One plus six equals seven. So the answer is: The answer is 7.","GPT Response: Well, I'm just a kid and I've never heard about this thing called order of operations. But I think I can try to figure out this sum. I'd do the multiplication first because I see the asterisk (*) symbol there, which I think means ""times"" or ""multiplication."" So, I'll do 3 multiplied by 2, which is 6. Then, I'll add 5 to that result. So, the sum would be: 

5 + 3*2
= 5 + 6
= 11.

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Well, I see there's an addition sign and a multiplication sign in this equation. I remember my teacher saying that we should do multiplication before adding. So, let me first find out what 3 multiplied by 2 is:

3 * 2 = 6

Now that I have this result, I'll put it back into the equation and perform the addition:

5 + 6 = 11

So, the answer is:

The answer is 11."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I haven't learned about the order of operations yet in math class. Let me try to figure it out by doing the multiplication first, then the addition.

First, I'll do the multiplication:
7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now, let me add those results:
14 + 40 = 54

So, The answer is 54.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I haven't learned about the order of operations yet. So, I'll just do this math problem by doing the multiplications first and then the addition.

Let's start with the multiplications:
7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now, let's do the addition:
14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't know about the order of operations yet. I would do the multiplication first, then the addition, because that's the way I've learned to do math in my class. So, I would do 7*2 = 14, then 8*5 = 40. After that, I would add the results together: 14 + 40 = 54.

The answer is: 54.","GPT Response: I'm just a little elementary student, so I don't really know about the special rules we have to follow when doing math problems. But let me try this 7 times 2 and then 8 times 5. So, first 7 times 2 is 14, and then 8 times 5 is 40. Now, I don't know if I should add these numbers together or what, but that's what I got for each step.

The answer is: 14 + 40 = __
