But let me try it both ways to see what happens.\n\nIf I do addition first, I get 8 + 3*2 = 14 (since 5 + 3 is 8).\n\nIf I do multiplication first, I get 5 + 3*2 = 11 (since 3*2 is 6).\n\nHmm, that's strange! The answers are different. I wonder which one is right. I should ask my teacher.\n\nAfter asking my teacher, she tells me that in Mathematics, when we have a problem with both addition and multiplication, we do the multiplication first, then the addition. This is called the order of operations.\n\nSo, in this problem, I should do 3*2 first, then add 5. That means the answer is 11.\n\nThe answer is 11."}]}]
