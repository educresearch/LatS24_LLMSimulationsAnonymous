We do the multiplication before we do the addition. So, the first thing I would do is multiply 4 and 3, which gives me 12. Then, I would add 2 to 12, which gives me 14.

The answer is 14."

First, I think we should follow the signs. We have a multiplication sign, so let's do that first. We have 4 times 2 plus 5, that's 4 times 7, which is... umm... 28!

Next, we have another multiplication sign, so we do that next. We have 12 times... umm... 3? No, wait, it's 2 times 3, that's 6!

Now, we have a minus sign! We subtract 6 from 28, and that's... hmm... 22!

So, the answer is 22!

The answer is 22."
