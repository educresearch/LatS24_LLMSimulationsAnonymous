llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this problem...

Okay, I know that when we add numbers, we have to do it in a certain order. Like, if we have 2 apples and we add 3 more apples, we get 5 apples. So, in this problem, we have 5 and 2, and we need to add them together. But there's this weird symbol in the way, called multiplication. I'm not sure what it does, but I think it means we have to do something with the numbers before we can add them.

So, let's see... we have 2 numbers, 4 and 5. We need to do something with the 4 first, because it's next to the multiplication symbol. I think we have to multiply 4 by 2, because that's what the multiplication symbol means. So, 4 multiplied by 2 is... hmm, let me see... 8! Yeah, that's right.

Now, we have 8 and 5, and we need to add them together. We can do that! 8 + 5 is... 13! Yeah, I'm sure that's right.

So, the answer to the problem 5+2*4 is... 13!

The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I've been given this math problem, and I'm supposed to use something called PEMDAS. I'm not really sure what that means, but I think it's like a secret code or something.

Okay, so the problem is 7 * 2 + 8 * 5. I'm not sure where to start, but I think I should do the multiplication first. That's what the ""M"" in PEMDAS stands for, right?

So, 7 * 2 is 14, and 8 * 5 is 40. Now, I'm supposed to add them together, but I'm not sure if I should add 14 and 40, or if I should add 2 and 5 first.

Oh wait, I just remembered something! My teacher said that when you have parentheses, you have to do the math inside the parentheses first. So, let's see...

(7 * 2) + (8 * 5) = 14 + 40 = 54.

The answer is 54! Woohoo, I did it! I hope that's correct, because I don't want to get a sad face on my homework. ðŸ˜…"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to follow some rules for doing math problems, but I'm not really sure what they are. I think I'm supposed to do things in a certain order, but I'm not sure what that order is.

So, let me see... we have 4 * 3, and that's 12. Then we have 2, and that's 2. So, if we add 12 and 2, we get 14.

The answer is 14.

(Note: This answer is incorrect because it does not follow the correct order of operations. The correct answer would be 16, which is obtained by first multiplying 4 and 3, then adding 2 to the result.)"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm glad you asked me to solve this math problem. I'm just a 6th grader, so I'm still learning stuff, but I'll do my best to figure it out.

Okay, so the first thing I see is the big parentheses, which means I gotta do whatever's inside them first. Inside the parentheses, I see 2+5, so I add those two numbers together and get 7. Cool!

Next, I see the multiplication sign, which means I gotta multiply 4 and 7. That gives me 28.

Then, I see the addition sign, and I see 12. I add 28 and 12, and that gives me 40.

Finally, I see the subtraction sign, and I see 2 times 3, which is 6. I subtract 6 from 40, and that gives me 34.

The answer is 34!

I hope that's right! Can you check it for me?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Hmm, okay, let me think...

So, we have 5 plus 3, that's easy, it's 8.

But then we have 3 times 2, that's 6.

So, 8 plus 6 is 14.

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll give it my best shot.

So, the problem is 5+2 * 4. I think I should start by adding 5 and 2, that's 7. Then, I multiply 7 by 4 and that's 28.

So, the answer is 28.

I hope that's right! Can someone tell me if I did it correctly?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But let's try to solve this problem together!

So, we have 7 * 2, which is 14. Then we have 8 * 5, which is 40.

Now, we need to add 14 and 40 together. That's easy! 14 + 40 = 54.

The answer is 54!"

So, the problem is 4 * 3 + 2. I think I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, so that's what I'll do.

4 * 3 = 12

Okay, now I'm supposed to add 2 to that? So, 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Okay! So, I know nothing about this PEMDAS thing, but I'll do my best to solve this problem.

First, I see a bunch of numbers and operators. Let's start by multiplying 4 and 2+5. That gives us 4 * 7 = 28.

Next, I see a plus sign and a minus sign. I'm not sure what to do with them, but I'll try to do what makes sense. I'll add 12 to 28, so that's 40.

Finally, I see a multiplication sign and a number. I'll multiply 40 by 3, which gives us 120.

So, the answer is 120! I hope that's right!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. I think it might be a way to do math in a special order, but I'm not sure what that order is.

I think I know how to do the multiplication part. That's when you have two numbers and you multiply them together to get a bigger number. So, 3 * 2 means 3 groups of 2, which is 6.

But then there's the plus sign. I think that means I have to add something else to the 6. I'm not sure what that something else is. Is it 5? So, would I add 5 and 6? That doesn't seem right.

I'm really confused. Can someone help me?

The answer is ???"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what this PEMDAS stuff is, but I can give it a try!

First, I would do the addition part, which is 5 + 2 = 7.

Then, I would do the multiplication part, which is 7 * 4 = 28.

So, the answer is 28.

The answer is 28."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm not sure what this ""order of operations"" thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this problem.

Okay, so I see a bunch of numbers and signs here. Let's start with the multiplication. I know that's what the * means. So, I'll start by multiplying 7 and 2, that gives me 14.

Next, I see another multiplication sign, so I'll multiply 8 and 5. That gives me 40.

Now, I'm not sure what to do next. I don't see any more multiplication signs, but there's this plus sign (+). I think that means I have to add something. So, I'll add 14 and 40, that gives me 54.

The answer is 54!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, so we have 4 * 3, that's 12.
Then we have + 2, that's 14.

The answer is 14.

I'm not sure if that's right, but that's my best guess!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to follow some rules when doing math problems, but I don't really know what they're called. I think it's something like ""Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally""? Yeah, that's it! So, let's see...

First, I need to do the stuff inside the parentheses. That's 2+5, which is 7. Then, I multiply 4 by 7, which is 28. Next, I add 12 to that, which is 40. Finally, I subtract 2 times 3, which is 6.

The answer is 40 - 6 = 34.

So, the answer is 34."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Hmm, okay! So, we have 5 + 3 * 2. I know that 3 * 2 is 6, so that's easy. Then, we have 5 + 6, which is 11. The answer is 11!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Okay, so we have a math problem that looks like this: 5+2 * 4.

First, we need to add 5 and 2. That's easy! 5 + 2 = 7.

Now, we need to multiply 7 by 4. That's easy too! 7 * 4 = 28.

So, the final answer is 28.

The answer is 28."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do multiplication before addition, but I don't know why. Can someone explain it to me like I'm 5 years old?

Okay, sure! Imagine you have 7 apples and you want to give 2 of them to your friend. That leaves you with 5 apples. Now, your friend has 8 apples and they want to give 5 of them to you. That means you'll have 10 apples!

So, when we do 7 * 2, we get 14. Then, when we do 8 * 5, we get 40. When we add 14 and 40 together, we get 54.

The answer is 54."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do multiplication before addition, but I don't know why. It's just a rule my teacher told me. So, I'm gonna follow the rule and do the multiplication first.

4 * 3 = 12

Now, I have my answer, but my teacher said I have to add 2 to it. So, I'll add 2 to 12.

12 + 2 = 14

llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Okay, let's try to solve this problem!

First, we need to do the stuff inside the parentheses. That's 2 + 5, which is 7.

Now, we have 4 times 7, which is 28.
