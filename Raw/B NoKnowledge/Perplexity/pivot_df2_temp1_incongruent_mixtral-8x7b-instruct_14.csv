mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Okay, I'm a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations. So, I'll just solve this problem step by step, following the order I learned in school.

First, I'll do the addition and subtraction inside the parentheses:

4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I'll do the multiplication inside the parentheses:

28 + 12 - 6 * 3

Now, I'll do the remaining multiplication:

28 + 12 - 18

Lastly, I'll do addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 - 18 = 40 - 18

40 - 18 = 22

The answer is 22.","GPT Response: Hi! I'm a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS) yet. But, I want to solve this problem: 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3.

First, I will do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7. So, we have 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3 now.

Next, I will multiply: 4 * 7 equals 28 and 2 * 3 equals 6. Now, we have 28 + 12 - 6.

Lastly, I will do addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 equals 40, then 40 - 6 equals 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I would follow the numbers and operations in the order they are given, starting from the left and working my way to the right. This approach is called ""order of operations,"" but I don't know that yet. Here's how I would work through this problem:

1. First, I would do the operation inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5, giving me 7.
2. Next, I would do the multiplication on the far left side of the problem, 4 \* 7, which equals 28.
3. Then, I would continue from left to right and do the next multiplication, which is 2 \* 3, giving me 6.
4. Finally, I would do the addition and subtraction from left to right: first, add 28 + 12, which equals 40, and then subtract 6 from it, leaving me with 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Okay, so I don't know about any order of operations or special rules for doing math. I just know how to do things in the order that they're written, from left to right. 

So first, I'll do the operation that's closest to the left side of the equation: the multiplication sign between the 4 and the opening parenthesis. That means I need to multiply 4 by whatever is inside the parentheses.

Inside the parentheses, I see another operation: addition. I'll do that next, adding 2 and 5 to get 7.

Now, I replace the (2+5) in the original equation with the result, 7:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I'll do the multiplication next to the 7: 4 times 7 equals 28.

Now, the equation looks like this:

28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Now, I just do the operations from left to right. I add 28 and 12 to get 40.

Now, the equation looks like this:

40 - 2 * 3

Now I multiply 2 and 3 to get 6, and then subtract that result from 40:

40 - 6

And finally, I get:

34

The answer is 34."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: I would first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then I would add 2 to 12, since I do addition before subtraction. The answer is 14.

So, I would first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then, I would add 2 to 12 to get 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I would first think about doing the multiplication and addition from left to right. So I would first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12, and then add 2 to get 14. But I heard from other students that there is a specific order we should follow in more complex problems like this one.

After learning a bit more about it, I found out that the correct order is to do any operations inside parentheses first (if there are any), then to do any multiplication or division from left to right, and finally to do any addition or subtraction from left to right. This is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction).

So for this problem, even though I was initially tempted to add 2 to 12 after multiplying 4 by 3, I now know that I should do the multiplication first and then the addition.

The answer is 12 + 2 = 14."
