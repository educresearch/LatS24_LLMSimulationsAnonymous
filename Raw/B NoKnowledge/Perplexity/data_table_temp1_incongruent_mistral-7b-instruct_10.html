      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I haven't learned the order of operations (PEMDAS) rule yet, so let me try to do this math problem step by step:<br><br>First, I see parentheses (2+5), so I'll do that calculation: 2 + 5 = 7.<br><br>Next, I see the "*" sign which represents multiplication, so I'll do that: 4 * 7 = 28.<br><br>Now, I see another "*" sign for 2 * 3. I'll calculate that too: 2 * 3 = 6.<br><br>Lastly, I have 12 - 6 which is subtraction.<br><br>So, I did all the multiplication and addition (from left to right), then did subtraction. The answer is:<br><br>The answer is 22.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I don't know the order of operations rule (PEMDAS) yet. Let's try to solve this problem step by step without knowing the correct order:<br><br>First, we see that there are parentheses, so we'll deal with that. Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5, so that's the next step.<br><br>Now, I remember that to add numbers, I should write the numbers in the same line and count how many groups of numbers I have and add the digits in each group from left to right. So, I write it as: 2 + 5 = 7.<br><br>Now, we have 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. But I'm not sure if the multiplication should come before or after the addition and subtraction, so let's just try to do the multiplication and addition from left to right first:<br><br>4 * 7 = 28, and then 28 + 12 = 40<br><br>Now, we have 40 - 2 * 3. Let's do the multiplication part first.<br><br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>Finally, I have 40 - 6. I can subtract smaller numbers from larger ones by rearranging the numbers and subtracting the smaller number's digits from the larger number's digits in each position.<br><br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>The final answer is ___, so the answer should be 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I would follow the simple arithmetic rule that we learn first, which is to do the operations inside the parentheses first, then perform multiplication and division from left to right, and finally do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So I will follow these steps:<br><br>1. Calculate the expression inside the parentheses: 2+5 = 7<br>2. Multiply the result by 4: 7 * 4 = 28<br>3. Add 12: 28 + 12 = 40<br>4. Finally, perform the subtraction: 40 - 2 * 3 = 38<br>5. The answer is __.<br>6. The answer is 38.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Alright, I'm an elementary school student and I've never heard of the order of operations in math before. Let's try to solve this problem step by step, just adding and then multiplying.<br><br>First, I see some parentheses, so I'll do what's inside them first:<br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now, I have 4 times 7, and then 12 and -2 times 3:<br><br>4 * 7 = 28 (I multiplied first because I don't know the order of operations)<br>12 - 2 * 3 = 12 (Subtracting first because I don't know the order of operations)<br><br>My final answer: The answer is 28 + 12.

      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm not familiar with the order of operations rule yet. But, I can try to solve the problem by doing the multiplication first and then the addition.

      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, this problem looks a bit confusing to me. I think I should do the multiplication first, then the addition. So, I'll do 4 times 3 which equals 12, and then add 2 to it. So, the solution is 12 + 2 = 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I might not be familiar with the order of operations yet. But I can still try to solve this problem by doing the multiplication first since it comes before the addition in the mathematical expression. So, I would calculator 4 times 3, which equals 12. Then I would add 2 to that result. Therefore, the answer is 12 + 2 = 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, this problem looks interesting. I see numbers and symbols that I recognize, but I'm not quite sure what they mean in this combination. Let's take it step by step.<br><br>First, I see the number 4 with a little star (âˆ—) next to it, and then the number 3. I think this might mean that I should do something called "multiplication," but I'm not really sure. So I'll try it out and see what happens.<br><br>So, I'll do 4 multiplied by 3, and get:<br><br>12<br><br>Now, I have the number 12, and I see the plus sign (+) and the number 2. I think this might mean I need to do "addition," but I'm not certain.

      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to answer this question since I don't know about the order of operations in mathematics yet. But I can try to guess how to solve it based on the symbols.<br><br>I see there is an addition sign (+) and a multiplication sign (*). I think the multiplication should be done first since it comes before the addition in the sentence "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally," which is a common mnemonic for remembering the order of operations (PEMDAS). So, I'll do the multiplication:<br><br>2 * 4 = 8<br><br>Now I have 5 + 8. I'm not sure if I should do the addition before or after the multiplication according to the order of operations, but I'll try to do it in a reasonable way. Since addition comes before multiplication in the normal order of doing arithmetic problems, I'll do the addition first:<br><br>5 + 8 = 13<br><br>So, the answer is:<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I know that in mathematics we have numbers and some special symbols, like the plus sign "+", the minus sign "-", and the asterisk "*" which means multiplication. But I don't really understand the order in which we should do these operations yet. I guess I should try to do the multiplication before the addition, just because the multiplication symbol is usually bigger than the addition symbol, but I'm not completely sure. Let me give it a try: First, I'll do the multiplication: 2 * 4 = 8. Now I have 5 + 8. I think I should do the addition now: 5 + 8 = 13. The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I have not learned about the order of operations in mathematics yet, so I would try to solve the problem by doing the simple addition first and then the multiplication. Here's my solution:<br><br>First, I'll do the addition (5 + 2). The sum of 5 and 2 is 7.<br><br>Next, I'll do the multiplication (2 * 4). The product of 2 and 4 is 8.<br><br>Now, I'll substitute the results of the addition and multiplication into the original expression and find the final answer:<br><br>The answer is 7 + 8.<br><br>However, without the order of operations rule, my answer may not be the correct one according to the mathematical rules. The correct answer would be 21 (using PEMDAS: 2 * 4 = 8, then 5 + 8 = 13, and finally 13 + 3 = 16, but 3 was mistakenly used instead of 4 in the final addition). So, although this is how a beginner student may incorrectly approach the problem, we know that the answer is actually 21.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, I'm not sure which operation to do first. Let me try this:<br><br>First, I'll do the multiplication because I think that's what the asterisk (*) means in math. So, I'll do 2 times 4, which makes 8.<br><br>Next, I'll do the addition with the result I got, which is 8, and the number I have left, which is 5. So, I'll add those two numbers together.<br><br>The answer is: 8 + 5 = 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't know about order of operations yet.
