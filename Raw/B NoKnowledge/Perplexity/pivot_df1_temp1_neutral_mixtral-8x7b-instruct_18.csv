mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the addition since that's what I learned so far. But I might get a different answer if I do the multiplication first. To make sure I get the right answer, I should ask my teacher about this.

Following the order of operations (PEMDAS), which means Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), I should do the multiplication before the addition.

So, I would first multiply 2 and 4 to get 8, then add 5 to it.

The answer is 13."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: If I was given this problem and I didn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would just do the operations from left to right. So I would first multiply 7 and 2, which equals 14. Then I would add 8 to that, which gives me 22. After that, I would multiply 8 and 5, which equals 40. But since I did the operations from left to right and didn't follow the order of operations, my answer is incorrect. I should have followed the order of operations, which means doing calculations in this order: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). Doing the calculation correctly this way, 7*2 equals 14, then 8*5 equals 40, and finally 14+40 equals 54.

The answer is 54."

So I would calculate 4 Ã— 3 first to get 12, and then I would add 2 to get 14.

The answer is 14."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Okay, so if I don't know about the order of operations, I would just solve the problem from left to right. Here's how I would do it:

First, I would do the multiplication:

4 \* 2 = 8
and
2 + 5 = 7
so
4 \* (2 + 5) = 4 \* 7 = 28

Next, I would do addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40
and then
40 - 2 \* 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

So, the answer is 34.

The answer is 34."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: As a 6th grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the addition since that's what I learned so far. But I might remember my teacher mentioning something about multiplying before adding, so I will do the multiplication first.

5 + 3 * 2

First, I'll do the multiplication:

3 * 2 = 6

And now, I'll do the addition:

5 + 6 = 11

So, the answer is 11."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Well, as a 6th grade student who doesn't know about order of operations yet, I would just do the math from left to right. So I would first add 5 and 2 to get 7, then multiply that result by 4.

7 * 4 = 28

The answer is 28."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will just solve this step by step according to how I learned it.

First, let's do the multiplication parts:
7 times 2 is 14,
and 8 times 5 is 40.

Then, let's add those multiplication results:
14 plus 40 is 54.

The answer is 54."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm a student in grade 6 and I don't know about the order of operations in Mathematics. But I can still try to solve this problem.

First, I'll do the multiplication because that's what I would do first if I didn't know about the order of operations. So, 4 times 3 equals 12.

Next, I'll do the addition. So, 12 (which is what I got from the multiplication) plus 2 equals 14.

The answer is 14."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Hi, I'm a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations in Mathematics yet. When I see a math problem like this: 4*\(2+5\)+12-2*3, I would first solve the parts in the parentheses. So, I would add 2 and 5 to get 7, and I would also multiply 2 and 3 to get 6.

Then, I would continue solving the problem by following the order I learned so far: multiply and divide before adding and subtracting. So I would first multiply 4 by 7 to get 28, and then I would add 12 to get 40. After that, I would subtract 6 from 40 to get the final answer.

The answer is 34."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+3*2,"GPT Response: As a 6th grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would start by doing the addition first because that's what I would naturally do.

So I would calculate 5 + 3 to get 8.

Then I would multiply the result by 2 to get 16.

Therefore, the answer is 16."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think about doing the problem from left to right. So I would add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then I would multiply that result by 4. Doing the multiplication gives me 28.

So, the answer is 28."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: I don't know about any order of operations rule, but I know that multiplication is repeated addition. So I would solve the multiplication parts first:

7 times 2 equals 14
8 times 5 equals 40

Then I would add those results together:

14 plus 40 equals 54

The answer is 54."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Hmm, this looks like a fun math problem! I'm not sure about any special rules, so I'll just solve it step by step.

First, I'll do the multiplication because that's what I see first: 4 times 3 equals 12.

Next, I'll do the addition: 12 (from the previous step) plus 2 equals 14.

So, the answer is 14.

The answer is 14."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: If I was given the math problem 4*(2+5)+12-2*3 and I didn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would probably solve it from left to right. But that can lead to different answers sometimes. So, I would ask my teacher or parent if there is a specific order to follow when solving math problems like this.

Following the correct order of operations, I would do the addition and subtraction inside the parentheses first, then the multiplication and division from left to right, and finally the addition and subtraction from left to right.

First, I would do 2+5 to get 7.
Then, I would do 4\*7 to get 28.
Next, I would do 2*3 to get 6.
Then, I would do 12-6 to get 6.
Finally, I would do 28+6 to get 34.

The answer is 34."

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Well, I don't know much about order of operations, but I remember my teacher saying something about multplication and division coming before addition and subtraction. So let's do the multiplication parts first.

7 times 2 is 14.

Now, we're left with 14 plus 40.
I can add those two numbers together.

14 plus 40 equals 54.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: I don't know much about order of operations, but I remember my teacher saying something about PEMDAS. That means we do Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, I see parentheses: 2 + 5. I'll do that first to get 7.

Now, I see 4 * 7, 12 - 2 * 3, and 2 * 3 left to right. I'll do those next.

4 * 7 is 28. 12 - 2 * 3 is a little tricky, but I remember that I should do the multiplication first: 12 - 6 is 6. 2 * 3 is 6.

Now, I have 28 + 6 and 6. I'll add those together to get 34.
