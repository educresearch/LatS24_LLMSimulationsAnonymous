      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure about the special rules for doing math problems. I'd suggest we do the operations inside the parentheses first, then anything with exponents, followed by multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction.<br><br>Let's apply that to the problem:<br><br>1. Inside the parentheses, add 2 and 5 -> 7<br>2. Multiply 4 by the result from the previous step -> 28<br>3. Add 12 -> 30<br>4.

      <td>GPT Response: As a 6th grade student, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations (PEMDAS) in Mathematics. However, let me try to solve the problem mentally with what I know so far:<br><br>1. First, I see that we have parentheses, so I will do what's inside it first: 2 + 5 equals 7.<br>2. Then, I see that I'm asked to multiply two numbers, so I will do that next: 4 multiplied by 7 equals 28.<br>3. Afterward, I see that another multiplication operation is present: 2 multiplied by 3 equals 6.<br>4. Surprisingly, there's also an addition problem and a subtraction problem left, so I assume these should be done last: I add 12 to 28, so the sum is 40. Then, I subtract 2 from 40, so the final answer is 38.<br><br>The answer is 38.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who knows nothing about order of operations, I would approach this problem from left to right and top to bottom on each line. So, I would first add 2 and 5, which gives 7. Then I would multiply 7 by 4, which gives 28. After that, I would subtract 2 from 12, which leaves me with 10. Finally, I would multiply 3 by 2, which gives 6. Then I would add the result, 28, to the previous result, 10, and subtract the final result, 6. The answer is 22.<br><br>The answer is 22.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I don't know about order of operations yet, but I can still try to solve the problem step by step. Let's do the operations inside the parentheses first:<br><br>1. Find the sum of 2 and 5: 2 + 5 = 7.<br>2. Multiply 4 by 7: 4 * 7 = 28.<br>3. Add 12 to the result: 28 + 12 = 40.<br>4. Multiply 2 and 3: 2 * 3 = 6.<br>5. Subtract 6 from the previous result: 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is __.<br>Answer: 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: As a elementary school student who does not know about the order of operations, I would follow these steps to solve the problem 4*3 + 2:<br><br>1. First, I would do the multiplication because I see the numbers 4 and 3, which makes a pair for multiplication. So, I'd calculate 4*3 = 12.<br>2. Then, I would do the addition because I see the plus sign (+) that tells me to add the numbers. So, I'd add the result, 12, to the number 2.<br>3.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just an elementary student and we haven't learned about the order of operations yet. But let's try to solve this problem in a way that makes sense to me. I think I should do the multiplication first because if I add 5 and then multiply 2 by 4, I might get a different answer than if I first multiply 2 and 4 and then add 5. So, lets do 2*4 which equals 8. Then I add 5 to 8, which gives me the final answer. The answer is __.<br><br>So, the final answer is: 5 + 2*4 = 13.
