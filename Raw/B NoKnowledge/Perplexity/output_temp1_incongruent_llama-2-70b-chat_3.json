So, we've got this math problem here, and I'm gonna try my best to solve it. Let's see...\n\nOkay, so first, we've got that 5. That's a pretty easy number to work with. Then, we've got that 3, and it's multiplying something. I'm not sure what that means, but I think it means we have to do some kind of special math thing. Like, maybe we have to add 3 and 2 together? But that doesn't seem right...\n\nOh, wait! I know! The special math thing is called multiplication! That means we have to add 3 groups of 2 together!
