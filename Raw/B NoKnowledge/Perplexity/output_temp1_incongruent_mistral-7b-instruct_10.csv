I see there is an addition sign (+) and a multiplication sign (*). I think the multiplication should be done first since it comes before the addition in the sentence ""Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally,"" which is a common mnemonic for remembering the order of operations (PEMDAS). So, I'll do the multiplication:

2 * 4 = 8

Now I have 5 + 8. I'm not sure if I should do the addition before or after the multiplication according to the order of operations, but I'll try to do it in a reasonable way. Since addition comes before multiplication in the normal order of doing arithmetic problems, I'll do the addition first:

First, I'll do the multiplications:
7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now, I'll try to do the addition:
14 + 40 = 54

But wait, something doesn't feel right. Maybe I made a mistake in the order of operations. Let's try it again:

This time, I'll do the multiplication that doesn't involve addition or subtraction first:
7 * 2 = 14

Now, I'll do the other multiplication:
8 * 5 = 40

Finally, I'll do the addition:
14 + 40 = 54

The answer is: 54."

First, I see the number 4 with a little star (∗) next to it, and then the number 3. I think this might mean that I should do something called ""multiplication,"" but I'm not really sure. So I'll try it out and see what happens.

So, I'll do 4 multiplied by 3, and get:

12

Now, I have the number 12, and I see the plus sign (+) and the number 2. I think this might mean I need to do ""addition,"" but I'm not certain. So I'll try that as well and see what comes out.

12 + 2 = 14

So following the order in which these operations were presented, the answer would be:

The answer is 14."

Let's try to solve this problem step by step, just adding and then multiplying.

First, I see some parentheses, so I'll do what's inside them first:
2 + 5 = 7

Now, I have 4 times 7, and then 12 and -2 times 3:

4 * 7 = 28 (I multiplied first because I don't know the order of operations)
12 - 2 * 3 = 12 (Subtracting first because I don't know the order of operations)

My final answer: The answer is 28 + 12. (I added the numbers I got after the steps I took.)"

First, I think we should follow the rules of the math game. But I don't really know what those rules are. Let's call them the Math Magic Rules.

The Math Magic Rules tell us to do multiplication before addition. But why? I don't know! Let's just follow the rules....

So, first we do the multiplication:
3 * 2 = 6

Now we have 5 plus this 6:
5 + 6

And then, it's like adding two 1's together:
5 + 6 = 11

The answer is _11_. (My teacher will be glad to know I tried my best! 😄)"
