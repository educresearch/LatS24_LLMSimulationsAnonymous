      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure what the commutative and associative properties are or how order of operations works in mathematics. But this problem has the multiplication sign first, so I guess that means we do the multiplication first, then the addition. So, I'll do 4 times 3, which equals 12, and then add 2 to that.<br><br>The answer is 14.<br><br>So, 4*3+2 equals 14. Hopefully, that's the correct answer!

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I don't know much about math yet, but my teacher told me that sometimes we need to follow certain rules when doing calculations. This is called order of operations, and it helps us get the correct answer. In this problem, we have to choose between multiplication and addition. My teacher said that we should do the multiplication first, then the addition. So, I'll start by calculating 4*3. That's 12. Now I'll do the addition. 12 + 2 equals 14.<br><br>The answer is __.<br>Answer: 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm just a young student, so I'm not yet familiar with the rules for solving mathematical expressions with multiple operations.

      <td>GPT Response: I see numbers and signs on the board. The first thing I notice is that there are numbers and an addition sign (+) and a multiplication sign (*). I've heard that we do multiplication before addition, but I'm not sure why. So let's try that.<br><br>First, I'll do the multiplication:<br>4 * 3 = 12 (I remember that 4 times 3 equals 12)<br><br>Next, I'll do the addition sign:<br>12 + 2 = 14 (I add 12 and 2 to get 14)<br><br>So, the answer to the problem 4*3+2 is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I haven't learned about order of operations yet. But I can try to solve it by guessing which operation to do first. I'll start with the addition because it looks simpler. So, I'll do 5 + 2, which gives me 7. Then, I'll do the multiplication with the result I got, which is 7 * 4.

      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I haven't learned about the order of operations yet.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I've seen numbers and some symbols, but I don't know their order yet. I'll try to do this in a way that seems logical to me. First, I'll do the multiplication because I see two numbers and a "*" sign, which looks like it means "multiply" to me. So, I'll find 2 times 4 and get 8. Then, I'll add the numbers I started with, which are 5 and 8. Let's see what that looks like: 5 + 8 = 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
