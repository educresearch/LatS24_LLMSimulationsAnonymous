mistral-7b-instruct,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm not yet familiar with order of operations or acronyms like PEMDAS. However, I've heard that we should do the calculations inside parentheses first, then exponents, followed by multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right.

Let's break it down:

1. Solve the calculations inside the parentheses:
   The expression inside the first parentheses is ""2+5"". I can do this addition right away, so 2 + 5 = 7.

2. Move on to the exponent (in this case, none):

3. Now let's do the multiplication: The expression is ""4*(7)+12"". Multiply 4 and 7 to get 28, then add 12: 28 + 12 = 40.

4. Lastly, let's do subtraction: The expression is ""40 - 2*3"". I need to follow the rule ""subtraction before multiplication"" because subtraction is a part of the ""addition and subtraction from left to right"" step. So subtract 2 from 3 and get 1, then subtract 1 from 40: 40 - 1 = 39.

The answer is 39.","GPT Response: As a 6th grade student, I'm not familiar with the order of operations in mathematics yet. But, let's try to solve this problem step by step, just like how my teacher taught us to do arithmetic.

First, I see that inside the parentheses we have 2 + 5. Let's do that first.

2 + 5 = 7

Now, we have 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I'll do the multiplication since those come before addition and subtraction according to what I've noticed in my textbook.

4 * 7 = 28

Now, I'll do the other multiplication.

2 * 3 = 6

So, my current equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

Now, I need to do the addition and subtraction from left to right.

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: As a first-grader, I don't know about the order of operations, but I can follow the rules of basic addition and multiplication. Let's do the problem step by step:

First, we need to do the multiplication since the numbers inside the parentheses were used in a multiplication operation (4 *):

1. 4 * (2 + 5)
2. 4 * 7
3. 28

Now, we need to do all the addition and subtraction from left to right:

1. 28 + 12
2. 40
3. Then, we have to subtract 2 * 3:
   - 40 - 2 * 3
   - 40 - 6
   - 34

The answer is __.
The answer is 34.","GPT Response: I don't know about the order of operations yet, so let's do the calculation step by step as if we're following instructions one by one:

First, we have 2 + 5, which makes 7.
Then we have 4 * 7 = 28.
Now we have 12 - 2 * 3. Let's do the multiplication part first which is 2 * 3 = 6.
So the last calculation is 12 - 6 = 6.

Adding 28 and 6 together, the final answer is...

The answer is 34."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm just a 6th grade student and I've never heard about PEMDAS or any order of operations rule for mathematics. But I see there are brackets, exponents, and multiplication and addition signs in this equation. I think I should do the multiplication first since there are no brackets or exponents, then add the numbers.

So, the solution would be:
4 * 3 = 12
Then 12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I don't know about the order of operations yet. However, I noticed that there are numbers, an asterisk for multiplication, and a plus sign for addition. I think I should do the multiplication first and then the addition. But I'm not sure if that's the rule. Let's try it out and see what happens.

First, I'll do the multiplication: 4*3 = 12
Now, I'll do the addition: 12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14. Let's remember to ask my teacher about the rule for these kinds of problems, as this way seemed to work, but I'm not completely sure.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't know about order of operations (PEMDAS) yet. But, I can still try to solve this math problem by following the rules I've learned so far. I will do the multiplication first because I've been taught that you do math in the opposite order of what's written, which is the opposite of PEMDAS.

First, I'll do the multiplication:
4*3 = 12

Now, I have 12 and a 2. Since I've only learned addition and multiplication, I'll add the numbers:
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a young student, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations rules, but I've learned that we should follow the same rule for addition and subtraction, and for multiplication and division. Let's read the problem again.

First, I see that there is addition: 4*3 + 2. But I don't remember if we should do addition before or after multiplication. Let's try doing the multiplication first and then the addition.

So, I'll do the multiplication: 4*3 = 12, then add 2:

The answer is ________

12 + 2 = 14

So, the answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I have not learned about order of operations yet. But I can try to solve this problem based on the rules that I know. According to what I see, the addition sign (5 +) comes before the multiplication sign (*) in the arrangement of the symbols. So I would do the addition first, and then do the multiplication.

First, I'll do the addition: 5 + 2 = 7

Next, I'll do the multiplication: 7 Ã— 4 = 28

So, the answer is: The answer is 28. (but I'm not really sure if this is correct)","GPT Response: Well, I'm just a grade 6 student and I'm not quite sure about this rule called PEMDAS. Instead, let's solve the problem step by step, shall we?

First, we have the addition sign (+) between 5 and 2*4, so I'll do the multiplication part first because I've heard adults say that we should do the multiplication before addition. So, let's calculate 2*4 = 8.

Now, we have 5 + 8. I think addition comes before multiplication, but since I'm not really sure, I'll just do the addition here. So, 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I have not learned about the order of operations in mathematics yet. I would approach this problem by doing the multiplication first because I see that symbol (*) before the addition symbol (+). So, I would calculate 2*4 to get 8. Then, I would add 5 to the result, so the answer would be 13.

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know about the rules for solving equations in the right order. But I'll try to do it step by step.

First, let's do the multiplication: 2*4 = 8.

Then, I have the addition left: 5 + 8.

The addition is easier! Just put the numbers together: 5 + 8 = 13.

So, I think the answer is: The answer is 13."

I need to finish this by finding the sum of 5 and 6. So, the answer is 11.","GPT Response: As a young student, I might not be familiar with the order of operations in mathematics, but I can try to solve this problem step by step. Let's see:

First, I'd do the multiplication, which is 3 times 2, giving me 6.
Then, I would do the addition, which is 5 plus 6, giving me my final answer.

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: I'm just a little student, and I'm not quite sure about the rules for this, but someone told me that we might need to follow certain steps when doing arithmetic. Let's see if I remember it right. This problem is 5 plus 3 times 2. I think we should do the multiplication first, because the number with the multiplication sign is in the middle of the other signs, right?

Here is my thought process:

1. First, Perform the multiplication:
