      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm in grade 6 and I've never heard about order of operations.

      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure what the letters in PEMDAS mean, but I see some numbers and symbols in front of me. Let's do this step by step:<br><br>First, I see the number 4 with a star (*) and the number 3. I don't know what the star means, but I think I should do this part first because it comes before the plus sign. So I'll do 4 multiplied by 3:<br><br>12 (4 * 3)<br><br>Now, I have the number 12 and the number 2 with a plus sign (+) in between. I think I should add those numbers because the plus sign is before anything else:<br><br>14 (12 + 2)<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I see numbers and symbols on this paper. The plus sign (+) means we add, and the asterisk (*) means we multiply. But I don't know in what order we should do these operations. Let's try both ways and see what happens!<br><br>First, I'll do the multiplication (4 * 3) and then the addition (12 + 2).<br><br>But wait! I changed my mind. Maybe I should do the addition first (3 + 2 = 5) and then the multiplication (5 * 4 = 20).<br><br>Now, let me compare the results of both methods to find out which one is correct.<br><br>First method: 4 * 3 + 2 = ?<br>Second method: 3 + 2 * 4 = ?<br><br>Let's check which one is the right answer!<br><br>We'll calculate both results and see which one fits the problem:<br><br>First method: 4 * 3 + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14<br>Second method: 3 + 2 * 4 = 3 + 8 = 11<br><br>Oops!

      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know about the order of operations in mathematics yet. Let me try to make sense of it based on what I see. Since the plus sign (5 +) is there before the multiplication sign (2 *), I thought I should add first. So I would do:<br><br>5 + 2 * 4<br><br>But then I'm not sure if that's correct since I've heard that sometimes we should do the multiplication first. Let me ask my teacher for help.<br><br>The answer is __. (I don't have an answer yet, I need to ask my teacher for help first).</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I have not learned about the order of operations in mathematics yet. So, I will solve this problem by doing the multiplication first, then adding the numbers. It looks like there's multiplication in the problem (2*4), so let's do that first:<br><br>2 * 4 = 8<br><br>Now, I have the number 8, and I need to add 5.

      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, this problem looks a bit confusing to me since I don't know anything about the order of operations yet. But let me try to solve it by doing the simplest calculations first.  Circle narrative here: I'll start by adding 5 and 2, which gives me 7. Then I'll take the result, 7, and multiply it by 4. That results in 28. So in simple terms, I added 5 and 2 first, and then multiplied the answer by 4.<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
