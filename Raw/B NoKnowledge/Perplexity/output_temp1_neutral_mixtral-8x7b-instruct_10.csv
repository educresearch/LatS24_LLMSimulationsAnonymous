I would add 3 and 2 to get 5, and then multiply the result by 4. So, the solution is:

4 * 5 = 20

Therefore, the answer is 20."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: I don't know about order of operations, but I know that if there are numbers and operations together in a math problem, we do the operation. So let's solve this step by step.

First, I see the operation ""+"" so I'll do 2 + 5, which equals 7.

Now the expression looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I see the operation ""*"", so I'll do 4 * 7, which equals 28.

The expression now looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Then, I see the operation ""*"", so I'll do 2 * 3, which equals 6.

The expression now looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, I see the operations ""+"", ""-"", so I'll do 28 + 12 first, which equals 40, and then subtract 6 from it, which results in 34.

The answer is 34."

But I remember my teacher telling me that there is a special rule for this called ""order of operations"" or BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEDMAS.

First, we do any operations inside parentheses (), then we do any exponents or indices ^, then we do multiplication and division (whichever comes first from left to right), and finally we do addition and subtraction (whichever comes first from left to right).

In this question, there are no parentheses, exponents, division, or subtraction, so we just need to do the multiplication first, and then the addition.

So, first, I'll do 3*2 to get 6.
Then, I'll do 5+6 to get 11.

The answer is 11."
