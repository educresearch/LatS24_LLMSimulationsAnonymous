So, I'll just solve this step by step according to how I was taught.<br><br>First, I'll do the operations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.<br><br>Now, my equation looks like this: 4 \* 7 + 12 - 2 \* 3<br><br>Next, I'll do the multiplication: 4 \* 7 equals 28 and 2 \* 3 equals 6.<br><br>So now, the equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Lastly, I'll do addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 equals 40, and then 40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

But, I will try to solve this problem by doing the operations from left to right.<br><br>First, I will do the operation inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5, that equals to 7.<br><br>Next, I will multiply 4 by the result I got from the parentheses, which is 4 \* 7, that equals to 28.<br><br>Then, I will add 12 to the result I got from the multiplication, which is 28 + 12, that equals to 40.<br><br>After that, I will do the second multiplication, which is 2 \* 3, that equals to 6.<br><br>Lastly, I will subtract the result I got from the second multiplication from the previous result, which is 40 - 6, that equals to 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I would start by doing the operations in the parentheses first, that's the "P" in PEMDAS. So, I would add 2 + 5 to get 7.<br><br>Then I would move to the next step, which is multiplying and dividing. There are two sets of multiplication and division, so I would do them from left to right. First, I would multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. Then I would multiply 2 by 3 to get 6.<br><br>Next, I would do addition and subtraction, again from left to right.

      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, this looks like a fun puzzle! I'm not sure about any special rules, so I'll just try to follow the order that makes sense to me.<br><br>First, I'll do the multiplication because I learned that multiplication is like counting lots of things at once, and it seems more important than addition.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I don't know about any order of operations rules. I just see a plus sign and a multiplication sign. I think I should do the multiplication first because it's harder to make a mistake that way. So I'd calculate 2 times 4 to get 8. Then I'd add that to 5.

So I would add 5 and 2 to get 7, then multiply that result by 4. Doing this, I get 28.<br><br>However, I recently learned that there's something called "order of operations" that tells you to do certain operations before others. It's often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>In this case, even though I did the addition and multiplication from left to right at first, I should have done the multiplication before the addition because it comes earlier in the order of operations. <br><br>So, if we follow the order of operations, we should first multiply 2 by 4 to get 8, then add the result to 5. Doing this, I get 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
