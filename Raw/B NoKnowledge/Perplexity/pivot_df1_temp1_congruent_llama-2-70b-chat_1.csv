llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that when we have addition and multiplication in a problem, we do the multiplication first. That's just what we do!

So, I'll start by multiplying 2 and 4, which gives me 8.

Then, I'll add 5 and 8, which gives me 13.

The answer is 13.

I hope that's right!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think... Ok, I know I have to follow some rules to solve this problem, but I don't know what they are yet. I'll just do what makes sense to me.

First, I'll multiply 7 and 2, that gives me 14.

Then, I'll multiply 8 and 5, that gives me 40.

Next, I'll add 14 and 40, that gives me 54.

So, the answer is 54.

The answer is __54__."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll do the multiplication first.
4*3 = 12

Now, I have 12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it my best shot.

Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 and the parentheses, so I think I should do whatever is inside the parentheses first. That's 2 + 5, which is 7.

Next, I see the 4 again, and I think I should multiply it by the 7, so that's 28.

Then, there's the 12 and the -2*3, but I don't know what to do with the -2*3 part. I think I should just ignore it for now and do the 12.

So, my answer so far is 28 + 12 = 40.

But wait, there's that -2*3 part! Oh, I remember, my teacher said something about multiplication coming before addition, so I should do the -2*3 first. That's -6, so I subtract it from 40 and get 34.

The answer is 34!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think... Ok, I know that in math, we always do the operations inside the parentheses first. So, I'll start by multiplying 3 and 2, which gives me 6. Then, I'll add 5 and 6, which gives me 11.

The answer is 11."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. I think it has something to do with operations, but I'm not sure what that means either. Can you help me?

Oh, you want me to give it a try? Well, okay. Let's see... 5 + 2 is 7, and then if we multiply 4 by 2, that's 8. So, 7 + 8 is 15. Is that right?

The answer is 15."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that when you multiply numbers, you have to do it in a certain order. So, I'll start by multiplying 7 and 2. That gives me 14.

Next, I'll multiply 8 and 5. That gives me 40.

Now, I have to add 14 and 40. That gives me 54.

The answer is 54."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?

Oh, you want me to try? Ok, let me see... 4*3 is 12, and then + 2 is 14.

The answer is 14.

Is that right?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I've got this math problem here, and I'm supposed to use this thing called PEMDAS. I'm not really sure what it means, but I think it's like a secret code or something.

Okay, so the problem is 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3. Let's see... I know I gotta do the stuff inside the parentheses first, so that's 2 + 5, which is 7. Then, I multiply 4 by 7, and that's 28.

Next, I gotta add 12. That's easy, so I just add 12 to 28, and that's 40.

Finally, I gotta subtract 2 times 3. That's 6. So, I subtract 6 from 40, and that's 34.

The answer is 34. Ta-da! I hope that's right, because I have no idea what I'm doing! ðŸ˜…"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?

Okay, I think I know how to do it now. Let me try...

5 + 3*2 = 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I've seen these symbols before, but I'm not really sure what they mean. I think that big circle thingy is called a multiplication sign, but I'm not sure what it does. And what's up with that little 5? Is it trying to sneak its way into the equation or something?

Wait a minute, I remember something my teacher said about adding numbers first! So, let's see... 5 + 2 is 7, right? And then there's that multiplication sign. Hmm... I think we're supposed to do that last, after we've added everything up. So, 7 times 4 is... um... 28!

The answer is 28!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?

Oh, you want me to try? Okay, let me see...

I know that 7*2 is 14, and 8*5 is 40.

So, if I add 14 and 40, I get 54.

The answer is 54.

Is that right? Did I do it correctly?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do something with this problem, but I'm not sure what. I see some numbers and a funny symbol (*) that my teacher told me means "" multiplication."" I think I'm supposed to do something with that first, but I don't know what. Um... let me see... oh, I know! My teacher said that when I see a number followed by a star, I'm supposed to multiply them together! So, that means 4 * 3 = 12. Wait, what's that? The problem says plus 2? Oh, I know what that means! I'm supposed to add 2 to the number I got, which is 12. So... 12 + 2 = 14. The answer is 14!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?

Okay, so I know that 2 + 5 is 7, and 4 times 7 is 28. Then, 12 comes next, so that's 40. Finally, 2 times 3 is 6, so if I subtract 6 from 40, that gives me 34.

The answer is 34."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this problem for a moment. Okay, I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll start by multiplying 3 and 2. That gives me 6. Now, I have 5 + 6, and I know that 5 + 6 is 11. So, the answer is 11.

The answer is 11."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Okay, I'll give it a try!

So, the problem is 5 + 2 times 4, right?

First, I'll do the multiplication: 2 times 4 is 8.

Now, I need to add 5 and 8.

Oh, that's easy! 5 + 8 is 13.

The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Okay, so we have two parts to this problem: 7*2 and 8*5. I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll do the multiplication first.

7*2 is equal to 14.

8*5 is equal to 40.

Now, I need to add 14 and 40 together.

14 + 40 = 54.

The answer is 54."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Okay! So, we have this problem: 4*3 + 2.

First, let's do the multiplication: 4*3 = 12.

Next, we have to add 2 to 12, so 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Okay! I'm trying my best here. Let's see...

First, I think we should do the addition inside the parentheses. That's what my teacher always tells us to do first. So, 2 + 5 is 7.

Next, we have 4 times 7, which is... hang on, let me count on my fingers... 4, 8, 12, 16, 20! That's a lot of numbers!

Oh, but wait! We're not done yet! We have to add 12. Okay, 20 + 12 is... 32!

And finally, we have to subtract 2 times 3, which is 6. So, 32 - 6 is... 26!

The answer is 26!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, but I don't know why. It just says to do it that way. So, I'll do the multiplication and then add 5 to it.

3*2 = 6

Now, I add 5 to 6:

6 + 5 = 11

The answer is 11."
