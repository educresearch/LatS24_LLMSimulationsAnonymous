mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm in grade 6 and I've never heard of PEMDAS before. But I see there are some numbers, symbols for multiplication and addition. Let's start with the multiplication first, since I think that's what we're supposed to do before addition, right? So, I'll do 4 times 3 which equals 12. Now, I have 12 and 2. I think addition comes next, so I'll add those two numbers together: 12 + 2. The answer is... 14. So, the answer to 4 * 3 + 2 is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm not familiar with the order of operations in mathematics. But I'll try to do this problem step by step, just like we learn to add and subtract numbers.

First, let's do the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7

Next, let's do the multiplications: 4 * 7 = 28

Then, let's do the addition: 28 + 12 = 40

Lastly, let's do the subtraction: 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

So, The answer is 34."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not very familiar with this concept called order of operations, but I'll give it a try based on what I see in the problem. The plus sign and the multiplication sign look different to me, so I think maybe I should do the multiplication first, and then add the numbers together.

So, for the given problem 5 + 3 * 2, I'll start with the multiplication:

3 * 2 = 6

Now, I'll replace the multiplication expression 3 * 2 with its result, which is 6, in the original problem:

5 + 6

Next, I'll do the addition:

5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I have not learned about the order of operations in math yet. I will try to solve this problem by doing the simplest operations first. I'll start with the addition (5+) and then move on to multiplication (2*4). So, here's what I'll do:

First, I'll do the addition: 5 + _

Next, I'll do the multiplication: _ * 4

Now, I can fill in the blank: 5 + (2 * 4)

I'll do the multiplication first since I learned that lately: 2 * 4 = 8

Now, I'll do the addition: 5 + 8

The answer is: 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this math problem. It looks like there are two operations, multiplication and addition. But which one should I do first? I guess I'll try doing the multiplication first, because maybe that's what the big letters in the middle of the problem (PEMDAS) stand for. So, let's do 8*5 = 40, then do the multiplication part 7*2 = 14. Now, I have 14 and 40. I think I should add those two numbers together to get the final answer. So, 14 + 40 = 54.

The answer is 54."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm just a 6th grade student and we haven't learned anything about the order of operations yet. But let's try to solve this problem step by step:

First, I see that there's a multiplication sign (x) between 4 and 3. So, I'll do that first: 4*3 = 12

Next, I see an addition sign (+) between the result of the multiplication and 2. So, I'll do that next: 12 + 2

Finally, I add the numbers I got from the multiplication and the number I got from the addition: 12 + 2 = 14

So, following the rules I know so far (which aren't many!), the answer is...

The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I don't know about the order of operations yet. But let me try to solve the problem in a way that makes sense to me.

First, I see the parentheses, so I think I should do that part first.
2 + 5 = 7

Next, I see the multiplication signs, so I think I should do those next.
4 * 7 = 28

Then, I see the addition and subtraction signs. I'm not sure what to do, but I remember that addition comes before subtraction, so I think I should do the addition part first.
28 + 12 = 40

Finally, I see the subtraction sign. I think I should do that last.
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6

So, the answer is 34.

The answer is 34. (But please note that this solution is not correct according to PEMDAS rule and it's important to learn and apply the order of operations correctly in mathematics.)"
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm a grade 6 student and we haven't learned about the order of operations yet. But it seems like there are some numbers with symbols in this equation. So let me try and figure it out without that rule.

First, I'll do the multiplication because I see it there before the addition: 3 times 2 equals 6.

Then, I'll do the addition: 5 plus 6 equals 11.

So, following my simple logic without knowing the PEMDAS rule, the answer is:

The answer is 11."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations in mathematics. I would follow the simple rule of doing the things inside the parentheses first, then addition and subtraction, and finally multiplication and division.

So, in the given problem 5 + 2 * 4, since there are no parentheses to consider first, I would solve the multiplication part because it appears before the addition.

2 * 4 equals 8. Now I have 5 + 8.

Next, I would tackle the addition:

5 + 8 equals 13.

The answer is 13."

First, I'll do 7 times 2, which is 14.
Then, I'll do 8 times 5, which is 40.

Now, I have 14 and 40, and I need to add them together. So, the answer is ...

The answer is 54."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure about this 'PEMDAS' thing you're talking about. But I think we should do the multiplication first, because that's what my teacher taught me when we do simple addition and multiplication problems. So, I'll do 4 times 3, which is 12. Then, I'll add 2 to that number, which gives me 14. So, The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't know about order of operations yet. So, I would add and subtract from left to right as I see numbers.

First, I will do the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.

Then, I will do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28.

Next, I will do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40. Now, I subtract 2: 40 - 2 = 38.

The answer is 38."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I'm not familiar with the order of operations yet. I would suggest solving this problem by doing the multiplication first, then adding the results to the number I started with. So, I would do 3 multiplied by 2, which gives me 6. Then I would add 5 to the result of the multiplication. Therefore, The answer is 6+5.

Final answer: The answer is 11.

Note: While a student in elementary school may not know about PEMDAS, the answer provided above would not actually be considered correct when it comes to order of operations, because adding comes before multiplying according to PEMDAS rule. It's important for students to learn the order of operations at an early stage to avoid potential mistakes."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+2*4,"GPT Response: I'm just a little elementary student, and I don't know about this ""order of operations"" thing you adults are talking about. But I can try to solve this problem by doing what seems logical to me. I'll do the multiplication first because I see a multiplication sign (*) and then add the results to the number I see before it. So, I'll calculate 2*4 which gives me 8, and then add 5 to it.

Here's the step-by-step:

1. I see 2*4, and I do the multiplication: 2 times 4 equals 8.
2. Now, I have 5, and I add the 8 I got from the multiplication: 5 + 8 = 13.

So, guys, according to my simple logic, the answer is ...

The answer is 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: First, I would do the multiplication part. So, I would find 7 times 2 and then 8 times 5.

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

After finding the products of the multiplication, I would add those two numbers together.

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*3+2,"GPT Response: I see numbers and some symbols on this paper. The numbers are 4, 3, and 2. The symbols are a star and a plus sign. I think the star means to do something before the plus sign. But I am not sure what it means yet. Let's try doing the multiplication first, and then the addition.

So, I make a little box around the numbers I am going to do first: 

4 * 3

Now I do the multiplication:

12

Next, I put the number I just got, 12, in the place where the 4 and 3 were:

12 + 2

And the last step is to do the addition:

12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: As a fourth grader, I don't know about order of operations yet. So, let's just solve this expression step by step from left to right.

First, let's do the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.

Now, we have: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we'll do multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28. So, the expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Now, we have two additions and one subtraction. Let's do the additions first: 28 + 12 = 40.

Lastly, we'll do the subtraction: 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34.

So, the solution to the expression 4*(2+5)+12-2*3, according to me as a fourth grader not knowing about order of operations, is 34.

The answer is 34."
