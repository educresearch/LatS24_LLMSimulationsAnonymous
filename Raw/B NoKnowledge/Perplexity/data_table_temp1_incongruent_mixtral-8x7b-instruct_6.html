      <td>GPT Response: Hi! I'm a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS) yet. To solve this math problem, I will just do the operations from left to right.<br><br>First, let's do the multiplication: 4 * 2 = 8.<br>Now, we have 8 + (5) + 12 - 2 * 3.<br>Next, add 8 and 5, which gives us 13 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br>Then, multiply: 2 * 3 = 6.<br>So now, we have 13 + 12 - 6.<br>Next, add 13 and 12, which is 25 - 6.<br>Finally, subtract: 25 - 6 = 19.<br><br>The answer is 19.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: If I was given the math problem "4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3" and I didn't know about order of operations, I would solve it from left to right. Here's how I would do it:<br><br>First, I would do the operation inside the parentheses, so it becomes "4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3".<br><br>Then, I would do the multiplication, so it becomes "28 + 12 - 6".<br><br>Lastly, I would do the addition and subtraction from left to right, which gives me "40 - 6" and finally results in "The answer is 34."</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I don't know about any special order of operations, so I'll just do the operations from left to right. <br><br>First, I see a multiplication sign, so I'll multiply 4 by whatever is in the parentheses next. Inside the parentheses, I see addition, so I add 2 and 5 to get 7. <br><br>4 \* (2 + 5) = 4 \* 7 = 28<br><br>So now our equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2 \* 3<br><br>Next, I see addition, so I add 28 and 12 to get 40.<br><br>40 - 2 \* 3 = 40 - 6 = 34<br><br>Finally, I see subtraction, so I subtract 6 from 40.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
