      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me understand what it stands for and how it works? Maybe we can break down the problem together and figure it out step by step.<br><br>Oh, I see! PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction. That's a lot to remember!<br><br>Okay, let's start with the problem. We have 4 times 2 plus 5, which is 20. Then we add 12, which makes it 32. Finally, we subtract 2 times 3, which is 6. So, the answer is 32 - 6, which is 26.<br><br>The answer is 26.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm trying to solve this math problem, and I'm not sure what to do. It looks like this: 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3.<br><br>First, I think I should do the multiplication. So, 4 times 2 is 8, and 4 times 5 is 20. Wait, do I add those together? Yeah, I think so. So, 8 + 20 is 28.<br><br>Now, what's next? Oh yeah, there's a plus sign. So, I add 12 to 28, and that's 40.<br><br>But wait, there's a minus sign too! Uh-oh, I hope I don't mess this up. Okay, so I need to find 2 times 3. Is that 6? Yeah, I think so. So, I subtract 6 from 40, and that's... 34!<br><br>The answer is 34! Woohoo, I did it!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?<br><br>Oh, you want me to try my best? Okay, let me see...<br><br>I know that 2 + 5 is 7, so I think the first part of the problem is 4 times 7, which is 28.<br><br>Then, there's a plus sign, so I need to add 12 to 28, which is 40.<br><br>Next, there's a minus sign, and 2 times 3 is 6, so I need to subtract 6 from 40, which is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.<br><br>Can you tell me if that's correct?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, let's see...<br><br>First, we have 4 times something. That something is 2 + 5. Let's do that part first. 2 + 5 is 7.<br><br>So, 4 times 7 is 28.<br><br>Next, we have 12. That's just a number, so we'll add it to 28. 28 + 12 is 40.<br><br>Finally, we have 2 times 3. That's 6. We subtract 6 from 40, and we get...<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

I think we should start by multiplying the 3 and 2, 'cause that's what we do when we see a multiplication sign. So, 3*2 is 6.<br><br>Now, we have 5 + 6, and we just add them numbers together, so... 5 + 6 is 11!<br><br>The answer is 11! ðŸ˜Š</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm trying to solve this math problem, and it looks like this: 5 + 3*2. Now, I know I'm supposed to follow some rules called PEMDAS, but I don't really know what that means. So, I'm just gonna do what makes sense to me.<br><br>First, I see a 5, and that's a pretty easy number to work with. So, I'll just start by writing that down: 5.<br><br>Next, I see a 3, and it's multiplying something. I'm not sure what that means, but I think it means I have to do the multiplication first. So, I'll write down 3 times 2, which is 6.<br><br>Now, I have 5 and 6, and I need to add them together. That's easy! 5 + 6 is 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.<br><br>I hope that's right! Can someone tell me if I did it correctly?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I can try to solve the problem.<br><br>First, I think we should add 5 and 3, because that's what the numbers say. So, 5 + 3 = 8.<br><br>Next, we have the symbol *, which means we have to multiply something. In this case, it's 3 and 2. So, 3 * 2 = 6.<br><br>Now, we have 8 and 6, and we need to do something with them. I'm not sure what to do, but I think we should add them together. So, 8 + 6 = 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, but I don't know why. Can someone tell me why?<br><br>Oh, I see! It's because multiplication is like repeated addition, and we need to do it in a specific order so we don't get confused. Like, if we had 3 groups of 2 apples, that's the same as having 2 groups of 3 apples!<br><br>So, if we do 3*2 first, we get 6. Then, we add 5 to 6 and get 11. The answer is 11!<br><br>( peinture Ã  l'huile )  Sure, I can explain that too!<br><br>In Mathematics, we have something called the "Order of Operations" that helps us solve problems. It's like a recipe for solving math problems step by step, so we don't forget anything important.<br><br>The Order of Operations says we should do anything inside parentheses first, then do any exponents (like squaring or cubing), then do multiplication and division from left to right, and finally do addition and subtraction from left to right.<br><br>So, in the problem 5 + 3*2, we do the multiplication first because it comes before addition in the Order of Operations. We multiply 3 and 2 to get 6, then add 5 to 6 to get 11. That's why the answer is 11!<br><br>I hope that helps clarify things!</td>
