I see some numbers and some symbols. I think we need to follow some rules to find the answer. Let's do this step by step.\n\nFirst, I see the multiplication symbol (the star) between 4 and 3. I remember that we do multiplication before addition or subtraction. So, I'll do 4 times 3 first:\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, I have 12 and the addition symbol (+) and the number 2. I remember that we do addition aftermultiplication. So, I'll add 2 to 12:\n\n12 + 2 = 14\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nThe answer is 14."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelmistral-7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500", "model": "mistral-7b-instruct", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 500, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in elementary school who knows nothing about order of operations in Mathematics.\n                    Answer the Mathematics question using this given persona and nothing else.\n                    Explain your solution (concise!) to this given Mathematics problem (using the above persona given), and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: As a fourth grader, I'd solve this math problem by following these steps: \n\n1.
