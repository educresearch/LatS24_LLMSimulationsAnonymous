Then I'll multiply that result by 4 to get 28. After that, I'll add 12 to get 40, and then subtract 2 times 3 from that, which is the same as subtracting 6.

So I would calculate 4 times 3 first and get 12. Then I would add 2 to it because that's the next operation. So I would do 12 plus 2 and get 14. Therefore, the answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: If I was given the math problem 4 x 3 + 2 and I didn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think about doing the operation that is easiest and makes the most sense to me. In this case, I know that multiplication and addition are both commutative and associative, so I can do them in any order and get the same answer. I would probably do the multiplication first, because I remember that my teacher usually writes multiplication before addition when she does math problems on the board. So I would calculate 4 x 3 to get 12, and then add 2 to get 14. Therefore, the answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I don't know much about this yet, but I know that if there's a "multiplication" and "addition" sign in the same problem, you should do the multiplication first. So for this problem:<br><br>4 x 3 = 12<br><br>Then, add 2 to the result:<br><br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>So, the answer is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

I think it's important to follow the rules so I can learn and get better at Math.<br><br>If I recall, my teacher said that we need to remember the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>Now looking at the question 5 + 2 * 4, I see that there are no Parentheses or Exponents.

      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about order of operations, I would first decide what to do based on the symbols I see. I see a plus sign and a multiplication sign. I know that multiplication helps me multiply the numbers that are right next to each other.
