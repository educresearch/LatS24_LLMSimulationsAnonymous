      <td>GPT Response: I would first remember that my teacher mentioned something called "order of operations" or PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>For this question, I see that there are parentheses, multiplication, addition, and subtraction. So I will follow the order of operations.<br><br>First, I will do the operation inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5. This equals 7.<br><br>So the equation now looks like: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I will do multiplication and division from left to right. I will do 4 * 7 first, which equals 28.

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I don't know about any order of operations or PEMDAS stuff. I just know that I have to solve this math problem from left to right, following the usual order of operations I learned in elementary school.<br><br>First, I see the operation of addition in the parentheses, so I'll do that part first: 2 + 5 equals 7.<br><br>Then, I follow that with the multiplication: 4 times 7 equals 28.<br><br>Next, I add the number 12 to that result: 28 + 12 equals 40.<br><br>Then, I do the last multiplication: 2 times 3 equals 6.<br><br>Finally, I subtract that result from the previous total: 40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: If I was given the mathematics problem "4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3" and I didn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first solve the operations that are inside the parentheses. This is because I would remember that my teacher always told me to do the operations in the parentheses first.<br><br>So I would add 2 + 5 to get 7.<br><br>Then the problem would look like this: "4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3"<br><br>Next, I would multiply 4 \* 7 to get 28 and 2 \* 3 to get 6.<br><br>So now the problem would look like this: "28 + 12 - 6"<br><br>Finally, I would add 28 + 12 to get 40 and then subtract 6 from 40 to get 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: If I look at this problem, I see numbers and operations, but I'm not sure what to do first. I remember my teacher telling me about something called "order of operations" that helps us know how to solve math problems with more than one operation. I think it's an important rule so that everyone solves these problems the same way.<br><br>I recall some letters - PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>So, I'll follow these steps:<br><br>1. Parentheses: There are parentheses in the problem, so I'll solve that part first: 2 + 5 = 7. Now the problem looks like 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br>2. Exponents: I don't see any exponents in this problem, so I can skip this step.<br>3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right): I'll do the multiplication first: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6. Now the problem looks like 28 + 12 - 6.<br>4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right): Finally, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40 and 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: As a student in grade 6 who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think about doing the operation that is easiest for me, which is multiplication. So I would multiply 4 by 3 to get 12. Now my equation looks like this: 12 + 2. Since addition is the only operation left, I would then add 2 to 12 to get 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: I don't know about any order of operations rule, but I know that addition and multiplication are two different operations. When I see a problem with both of these operations, I solve it step by step. In this problem, I see a multiplication first (4 \* 3), so I'll do that part first: 4 \* 3 = 12. Now I have a new problem: 12 + 2. I know how to add numbers, so I do 12 + 2 and get 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I will solve this problem by doing the operations from left to right.<br><br>First, I will multiply 4 and 3, which gives me 12.<br>Then, I will add 2 to 12, which gives me 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
