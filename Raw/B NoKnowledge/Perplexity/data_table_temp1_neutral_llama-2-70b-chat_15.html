      <td>GPT Response: Okay, I'll give it a try!<br><br>First, I see some multiplication, so I'll start with that. The 4 times 2 is 8, and then plus 5 is 13.<br><br>Next, I see some addition, so I'll do that next. 12 plus 13 is 25.<br><br>Finally, I see some subtraction. 2 times 3 is 6, and then subtracting 6 from 25 gives me 19.<br><br>The answer is 19!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not really sure about this thing called "order of operations" or PEMDAS. But I'll give it my best shot!<br><br>So, the problem is 4*(2+5)+12-2*3, right? I think we should start by adding 2 and 5 together, that's 7. Then we multiply 4 by 7, that's 28. Next, we add 12, that's 40. Finally, we subtract 2 times 3, that's 6.<br><br>So, the answer is 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.<br><br>I hope that's correct! Can someone please tell me if I did it right?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, wow! That's a big math problem! Let me see...<br><br>Okay, first I would do the addition inside the parentheses. That's 2+5, which is 7.<br><br>Then, I would multiply 4 by 7, and that's 28.<br><br>Next, I would add 12 to 28, and that's 40.<br><br>Lastly, I would subtract 2 times 3, which is 6, from 40.<br><br>The answer is 34!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, let's see...<br><br>First, I know that when we have parentheses, we have to do what's inside them first. So, I'll start by adding 2 and 5, which gives me 7.<br><br>Next, I have to multiply 4 by 7, which gives me 28.<br><br>Then, I have to add 12 to 28, which gives me 40.<br><br>Finally, I have to subtract 2 times 3 from 40, which gives me 37.<br><br>The answer is 37.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not really sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But let's see... 4*3 means 4 groups of 3, which is 12. Then there's this plus sign, and it's telling me to add 2 to 12. So, 12 + 2 = 14. The answer is 14!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so we have a problem that looks like this: 4*3+2. I'm not sure what that means, but I think we're supposed to do the multiplication first. So, 4 times 3 is... (pauses to think) 12!<br><br>Now, what's next? Oh yeah, we have a plus sign. That means we have to add something. There's a 2 there, so we'll add that to 12. (pauses to think) 12 + 2 = 14!<br><br>So, the answer is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! So, let's see... 4 times 3 is 12, and then we have to add 2 to that. So, 12 + 2 is... ummm... 14! The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this...<br><br>Okay, I know that when we add numbers, we have to do it from left to right. So, first, I'll add 5 and 2, which gives me 7.<br><br>Next, I see that there's a multiplication sign, and I know that multiplication comes before addition. So, I'll multiply 4 by 2, which gives me 8.<br><br>Now, I have 7 and 8. I'm not sure what to do next, but I think I should add them together. So, 7 + 8 = 15.<br><br>The answer is 15.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey, I'm just a grade 6 student, and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But let's try to solve this problem together!<br><br>Okay, so we have 5 + 2 * 4.

Can you help me understand what PEMDAS means and why it's important in Math?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so we have this problem: 5+2*4. I'm not sure what PEMDAS means, but I think we do the multiplication first because it's like a secret code. So, 2 times 4 is 8. Now, we add 5 and 8, and that's 13! The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, I'll try my best!<br><br>So, I know that when we do math, we usually start with the numbers that are inside the parentheses. In this case, there's a 2 inside the parentheses, and it's multiplying another number, 4. So, I think I need to do that multiplication first.<br><br>2 x 4 = 8<br><br>Now, there's a 5 outside the parentheses, and it's adding something. I'm not sure what it's adding yet, but I'll find out soon!<br><br>5 + 8 = 13<br><br>The answer is 13!</td>

I'm not sure what that star thing means, but I think it's like a special symbol that means we have to do something special with the numbers. So, I'm just gonna do what makes sense to me.<br><br>First, I'll add 5 and 3, that's easy, it's 8.<br><br>Now, I'm not sure what to do with the 2, so I'll just leave it alone for now.<br><br>Oh, wait! I remember something my teacher said about multiplication being like repeated addition.

      <td>GPT Response: Hi! I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?<br><br>Okay, so I know that 5 + 3 is 8, and 3 * 2 is 6. But then I'm not sure what to do.<br><br>Oh, I know! Let me try this: 8 + 6 = 14!<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

I know what addition is, but I don't know how to do it with these numbers.<br><br>I think I need to learn PEMDAS to solve this problem. Can you teach me what it means and how to use it?<br><br>Oh, I see! PEMDAS stands for "Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction." That sounds like a lot to remember!<br><br>So, let's see... first, we need to do the multiplication. There's a 7 and a 2, so we need to multiply those together.
