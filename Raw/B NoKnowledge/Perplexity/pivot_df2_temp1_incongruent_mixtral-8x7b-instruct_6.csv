mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: I don't know about any order of operations rule, but I can still try to solve this problem. I would start from the left and do the multiplication and addition first because that's what I would do normally.

So, I would do 4 \* (2+5) first which is 4 \* 7 = 28.

Then I would do 12 - 2 \* 3 which is 12 - 6 = 6.

And finally, I would add 28 and 6 to get 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Hi! I'm a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS) yet. To solve this math problem, I will just do the operations from left to right.

First, let's do the multiplication: 4 * 2 = 8.
Now, we have 8 + (5) + 12 - 2 * 3.
Next, add 8 and 5, which gives us 13 + 12 - 2 * 3.
Then, multiply: 2 * 3 = 6.
So now, we have 13 + 12 - 6.
Next, add 13 and 12, which is 25 - 6.
Finally, subtract: 25 - 6 = 19.

The answer is 19.","GPT Response: If I was given the math problem ""4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3"" and I didn't know about order of operations, I would solve it from left to right. Here's how I would do it:

First, I would do the operation inside the parentheses, so it becomes ""4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3"".

Then, I would do the multiplication, so it becomes ""28 + 12 - 6"".

Lastly, I would do the addition and subtraction from left to right, which gives me ""40 - 6"" and finally results in ""The answer is 34.""","GPT Response: I don't know about any special order of operations, so I'll just do the operations from left to right. 

First, I see a multiplication sign, so I'll multiply 4 by whatever is in the parentheses next. Inside the parentheses, I see addition, so I add 2 and 5 to get 7. 

4 \* (2 + 5) = 4 \* 7 = 28

So now our equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2 \* 3

Next, I see addition, so I add 28 and 12 to get 40.

40 - 2 \* 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

Finally, I see subtraction, so I subtract 6 from 40.

The answer is 34."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: As a 6th grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first guess that you can just solve the multiplication and addition from left to right. But I've heard that sometimes you have to follow certain rules to get the right answer.

Looking at this problem, 4 * 3 + 2, I would first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then I would add 2 to 12, which gives me 14.

So, even without knowing the specifics of the order of operations, I would still answer:

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12, then add 2 to get 14. This is because I don't know that I'm supposed to do multiplication and division before addition and subtraction.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: I would first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12, then I would add 2 to 12. So, 12 + 2 equals 14.
