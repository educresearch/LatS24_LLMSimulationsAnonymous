mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations in mathematics, which is often represented by the acronym PEMDAS. However, I've heard that certain mathematical operations should be done in a specific order to get the correct answer.

Let me try to solve the given expression, 5 + 2 * 4, based on a reasonable-looking order, which I believe is to do multiplication before addition.

So, the first step would be to do the multiplication: 2 * 4 = 8

Next, add the number that was originally outside of the multiplication sign: 5 + 8

Now, do the addition: 5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13."

mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to do here, but I think I've heard about something called order of operations. I guess it's like rules for solving math problems. Let's see if I can figure out this one:

1. The first operation is multiplication, so I'll do that first: 4 * 3 = 12
2. Then there's this addition thing (plus sign), so I'll do that next: 12 + 2 = 14

So, the answer is: The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm not familiar with the order of operations rule in mathematics yet, so let me try to solve this problem step by step, following the way that looks most logical to me.

First, let's do the addition inside the parentheses:

4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3

= 4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I'll do the multiplication:

= 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

= 28 + 12 - 6

Now, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right:

= 40 - 6

= 34

So, the answer is...

The answer is 34."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I've only begun learning addition and multiplication, but I've heard my teacher mention something called ""order of operations"". Let's see if I can apply that to this problem.

First, I need to make sure I'm doing the multiplication before the addition, according to what my teacher said is the first rule (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction, or something like that). So, I'll do the multiplication first:

3 * 2 = 6

Now, I have 5 plus 6, which equals:

5 + 6 = 11

So, the answer is:

The answer is 11."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I've learned to add and multiply numbers, but I don't know about the order of operations yet. Let's just follow what we know and do the multiplication first, then the addition.

So, we have 2 multiplied by 4, which is 8. Now, we add 5 to this result.

The answer is: 5 + 8 = 13. But, this might not be the correct answer according to the order of operations rule (PEMDAS), which states that multiplication and division should be done before addition and subtraction. So, it's essential to learn and follow the order of operations to get the correct answer in Mathematics."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I don't know about order of operations yet. When I see an expression with multiplication and addition, I usually do the multiplication first and then the addition. So I'll start with the multiplications:

1. Multiply 7 by 2: 7 x 2 = 14
2. Multiply 8 by 5: 8 x 5 = 40

Now, I'll do the addition:

3. Add the results from step 1 and step 2: 14 + 40

The answer is:

44

So, The answer is 44."

First, I'll do the operation inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

So the problem becomes:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I'll do the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right:
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I've never heard of PEMDAS rule in mathematics. I'd solve this problem the way it looks to me. First, I'd do the multiplication since it's written there first. So, 3 multiplied by 2 equals 6. Then, I'd do the addition part. So, 5 plus 6 equals 11.

The answer is 11."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Well, I'm just an elementary school student, so I don't really understand this ""order of operations"" thing you're talking about. But let me try to solve this problem with some common sense:

First, I see that there's addition and multiplication in this expression. I guess I should do the multiplication first because I learned that you can't add numbers until you know what each Addend is. So, let's do 2 * 4: that's 8.

Now, with this new number, I can add 5: 5 + 8. That makes 13.

So, the answer is: The answer is 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know about the order of operations in mathematics yet. But I can try to do it by guessing which one to do first. I think I should do the multiplication first because I remember that when we do math, we usually do multiplication before addition. So I'll do 8 * 5 = 40. Then I'll do the other multiplication: 7 * 2 = 14. Finally, I'll add the two results: 14 + 40 = 54.

The answer is 54."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to answer this question as I'm just an elementary school student and I don't know about order of operations (PEMDAS) yet. But none the less, I'll try to solve it. I think we should do the multiplication first because it comes before addition according to the rules I've heard. So, I'll do 4 times 3 which equals 12. Then I add 2 to 12 which gives me the final answer.

The answer is 14. (But in reality, the answer is actually 13 according to the order of operations rules. This is a common mistake for beginners, doing the multiplication and then adding which results in carrying over a digit or making the problem more complicated. So, 13 is the correct answer)"
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: I'm an elementary school student and I'm not sure what the order of operations is. But I can try to solve this problem step by step.

First, I see some parentheses, so I'll do what's inside them first: 2 + 5 equals 7.

Then I have 4 times 7, which is 28.

Next, I see another multiplication: 12 times 3, which is 36.

Then, I see a subtraction: 28 from 36, which leaves me with 8.

The answer is 8."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm just a kid and I don't know much about the rules for solving math problems, but I think maybe we should do the multiplication first because the asterisk (star) symbol looks like it means ""times,"" and then do the addition after that. So it would look something like:

First, do 3 * 2 = 6
Then, add 5 = 11

So, The answer is 11."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Well, according to what I've learned so far in elementary school, we usually do addition and subtraction before we do multiplication and division. But, in this case, there's only addition and multiplication. Hmm... Let me try a simple approach without any fancy rules, it might work this time. So, I'll do the multiplication first that is, 2 * 4, which equals 8. Then, I'll do the addition, which is 5 + 8.

The answer is 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't know about the order of operations yet. But I can still try to solve this problem by doing the multiplication first and then the addition. So, I'll do 7 * 2 and 8 * 5, and then add the results together.

First, I'll do 7 * 2 which is 14. Then, I'll do 8 * 5 which is 40. And finally, I'll add those two numbers together to get the final answer.

So, The answer is 14 + 40 = 54."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Hmmm, this looks like a fun math problem! I see numbers and some symbols, but I'm not sure what they mean yet. Let's try to figure it out step by step.

First, I see the number 4 with a tiny star (*) next to it. I think that means I should do something with the number 3 that's next to it. But what? Let's give it a try and see if it makes sense.

So, I'll do the * symbol thing, and that means I'll get 12 (4 multiplied by 3).

Now, I have the number 12 and the + symbol next to 2. I think I know what the ""+"" symbol means - it's for adding numbers together!

So, I'll add the numbers 12 and 2. This makes 14.

The answer is __.
The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I'm not familiar with the order of operations in mathematics yet. Let's solve this problem step by step, following the way I naturally understand it.

First, let's do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7

Now, we have: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, let's do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28, 2 * 3 = 6

Now, the equation looks like: 28 + 12 - 6

With no order of operations in mind, I would suggest doing this in the following order:

1. Subtract the number right after the minus sign: 28 + 12 - 6 = 28 + 12 - 5
2. Perform addition: 33 - 5 = 28

The answer is: The answer is 28."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Well, I see some numbers and some signs. I think I need to follow some rules to find the answer. Let's try this: First, I'll do the multiplication because I saw that rule somewhere, but I'm not really sure why. So, 3 times 2 makes 6. Then I'll add 5 to that result. So, 5 plus 6 is 11.

The answer is 11."
