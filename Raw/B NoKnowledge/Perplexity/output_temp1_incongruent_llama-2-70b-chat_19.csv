I think I'm supposed to multiply 4 and 3, but then there's this plus sign and the number 2. I'm not sure what that means.

Oh wait, I think I remember something from class! The plus sign means we have to add something. So, if we multiply 4 and 3, that gives us 12, and then if we add 2, that makes 14.

The answer is 14."

First, let's start by following the order of operations:

1. Parentheses: inside the parentheses we have 2+5 = 7
2. Exponents (none in this case)
3. Multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28
4. Addition: 28 + 12 = 40
5. Subtraction: 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34!"
