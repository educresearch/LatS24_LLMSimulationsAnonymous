      <td>GPT Response: As a Grade 6 student, I've never heard of PEMDAS or order of operations before. But I can try to solve the problem based on the information given to me. Usually, when doing math problems, we follow certain rules to make sure we get the correct answer. In this case, we have an addition sign (+)and a multiplication sign (*).<br><br>Here's what I think we should do: since multiplication comes before addition according to the PEMDAS rule, we should first do the multiplication part 2 * 4 = 8.

      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I have not learned about order of operations in mathematics yet. So, I will do this calculation based on what seems logical to me. I will do multiplication before addition, because in my experience, we often do multiplication before addition in everyday life. Based on this logic, here's my solution:<br><br>First, I will do the multiplication: 2 * 4 = 8<br><br>Then, I will do the addition: 5 + 8<br><br>So, the final answer is: The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem, since I don't know about the order of operations in mathematics yet. But I can try to guess what the answer might be by doing the addition and multiplication one at a time, and seeing which one gives a higher result.

Then we add 5: 5 + 8 = 13.<br><br>So, The answer is 13. <br><br>But this might not be the correct answer according to the order of operations rules in mathematics.

      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I've been learning basic arithmetic, but I've never heard of the order of operations rule (PEMDAS). When given a math problem like this one: 5 + 3 * 2, I'm not sure how to proceed.<br><br>My instinct tells me to do addition before multiplication since that's the natural order. But based on the numbers provided, if I calculate the multiplication first (3 * 2 = 6), then the addition (5 + 6), I get a different answer than if I do the addition first (5 + 3 = 8, then 8 * 2).<br><br>Feeling unsure, I would ask my teacher or a classmate for help if this question came up in a math exercise or test. However, without any guidance, my initial guess would be to perform the addition first. Please note that this is not the correct answer according to the order of operations rule.<br><br>The answer is: 5 + 3 * 2 = __.

So, I'll do the multiplication first: 3 * 2 equals 6. Now, I'll do the addition: 5 + 6. That's one, one, one, one, one, one, and one more, so the answer is 7.<br><br>The answer is 7.</td>

I guess I'll try to do this problem based on what looks logical to me. Let's see, we have 5 plus 3, but then there's this 2 that's being multiplied. Hmm, maybe I should do the multiplication first, since it comes before the addition in the problem? I don't really know, but let's give it a try. So, we have 3 times 2, which equals 6. Then, I add 5, which gives me 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
