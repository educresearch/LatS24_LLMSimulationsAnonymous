But I can still try to solve the problem step by step, just like my teacher taught me. Let's start with the multiplication and then do the addition:

1st step: Multiply 4 and 3: 4 x 3 = 12
2nd step: Keep the result, 12, and do the addition: 12 + 2

So, the final answer is...

The answer is 14."

But I don't know about anything called ""order of operations"" yet. I'll just do the calculations in the order I see them from left to right.

First, let's do the addition inside the parentheses: 2+5 equals 7.

Now, multiply: 4 times 7 is equal to 28.

Next, subtract: 12 minus 2 is 10.

Lastly, another subtraction: 10 minus 3 is 7.

The answer is 7."

So, let me just follow the way the symbols are arranged from left to right. I'll start with the addition sign and then move on to the multiplication sign. That means I'll do the multiplication first and then the addition. But since I don't know the rule for multiplication before addition, let's ask someone who knows better to help us. The answer is: I'm not sure, should ask someone who knows the order of operations.

The answer is __ (to be determined by someone who knows the order of operations)."
