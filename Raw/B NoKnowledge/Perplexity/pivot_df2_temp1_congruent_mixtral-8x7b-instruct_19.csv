mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I would follow the steps below:

1. First, I would perform the operations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.
2. Next, I would do the multiplication: 4 times 7 equals 28, and 2 times 3 equals 6.
3. Then, I would do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 plus 12 equals 40, and 40 minus 6 equals 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Hi! I'm a grade 6 student who doesn't know about order of operations (PEMDAS) yet. When I see a math problem like this, I would just follow the order of the operations from left to right. I would first do the addition and subtraction inside the parentheses, then the multiplication, and finally the last multiplication and addition.

So, let's solve it step by step:

1. inside the first parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7
2. now, 4 \* 7 = 28
3. next, 12 - 2 \* 3 = 12 - 6 = 6
4. and finally, 28 + 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: If I was answering this question as an elementary school student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would probably do the operations from left to right. So I would first multiply 4 and 2, then add 5, then multiply the result by 4, then add 12, and finally subtract 2 times 3.

Doing this, I get:
4 \* 2 = 8,
then 8 + 5 = 13,
then 4 \* 13 = 52,
then 52 + 12 = 64,
and finally 64 - 2 \* 3 = 64 - 6 = 58.

So the answer is 58. However, I later learned that the correct way to simplify this expression is to follow the order of operations, which would give a different answer (48).","GPT Response: I don't know about order of operations, but I know that we should do the operations inside the parentheses first. So, I will add 2 and 5 to get 7. Then I will have:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I will multiply 4 by 7 to get 28, and then multiply 2 by 3 to get 6. So now I have:

28 + 12 - 6

I will add 28 and 12 to get 40, and then subtract 6 from 40.

The answer is 34."

The problem is: 5 + 2*4

I can solve it step-by-step like this:

1. I will do the addition first: 5 + 2 = 7
2. Then I will do the multiplication: 7 * 4 = 28

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Well, I'm in grade 6 and I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS). So, I think I should just follow the math problem from left to right.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the addition part since that's what I see first. But I remember my teacher telling me that sometimes, we need to follow certain rules to get the right answer.

In this case, the operation * is before the + sign. So I should do the multiplication first.

Doing 3*2 gives me 6.

But I remember my teacher mentioning something called ""order of operations"" that we'll learn later. So, I better follow that rule to get the correct answer.

First, I do the multiplication because in order of operations, you do that before addition. So I multiply 3 and 2 to get 6.
