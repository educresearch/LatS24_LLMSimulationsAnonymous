      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what those strange symbols mean, but my teacher told me to follow some rules when doing math problems. Let's see, there are these weird letters: P, E, MD, as, and S. Let's see which one applies here.<br><br>* The P stands for Parentheses, but there aren't any in this problem.<br>* E is for Exponents. We don't have any exponents either.<br>* MD stands for Multiplication and Division, and there's both here, so let's deal with those first.<br>* as is for addition and subtraction. Also present in this problem.<br>* S is for "whatevers left," but let's see if there are other rules first.<br><br>Since we have Multiplication and Division, we should do those first, from left to right.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I've heard that we need to follow certain rules when doing math problems. But to be honest, I don't know what those rules are yet. So let's just do this multiplication first because it comes before addition in my head: 4 times 3 makes 12. Now I have 12, and I need to add 2. So 12 plus 2 makes 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

But I can try to solve the problem based on what I think makes sense!<br><br>The expression 5+2*4 looks a bit confusing to me with those addition and multiplication signs there. So, I think I'll do the multiplication first since I've been told that sometimes it comes before addition.<br><br>Let's see...2 multiplied by 4 equals 8. So, now my expression looks like this: 5 + 8<br><br>Hmm...now there's an addition sign and a number in front of it.

      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I have not learned the rule for order of operations in mathematics yet. So, let's do the multiplication first and then add, as it might look simpler that way to me.<br><br>First, I will do the multiplication: 2 * 4 = 8<br><br>Now, I will do the addition: 5 + 8<br><br>The answer is: 13.<br><br>So, the solution to the problem 5 + 2 * 4 is 13. But I should remember that in mathematics, we should always follow the order of operations: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). In this problem, it seems that following the simple "do the multiplication first, then add" rule leads to the same result, but that's just a coincidence.</td>
