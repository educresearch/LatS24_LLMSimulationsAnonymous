mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: I would first remember that my teacher said something about a special rule called PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Looking at the problem 5 + 2 * 4, I don't see any parentheses or exponents, but I do see multiplication and addition. According to PEMDAS, I should do the multiplication first.

So I would calculate 2 * 4 first, which equals 8.

Then I would do the addition, so I would calculate 5 + 8, which equals 13.

Therefore, the answer is 13."

First, multiply 7 and 2: 7 * 2 = 14

Now, add the result to 8 * 5: 14 + 8 * 5

Next, multiply 8 and 5: 14 + 40 = 54

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: As a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first recall my basic arithmetic skills. I see we have addition and multiplication in the question. I know that I learned to do multiplication before addition, so I will start by multiplying 4 and 3. That gives me 12.

Then, I have 12 plus 2. Adding those numbers together, I get 14.

The answer is 14."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Okay, so I don't know about this ""order of operations"" thing, but I know how to do math. I'll just do the operations from left to right.

First, I'll do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.

So now the equation looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, I'll do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6.

Now the equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.

Lastly, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40, then 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the addition first since that's what I learned so far. But I might realize that some rules need to be followed to get the correct answer.

So, let me solve it step by step:

5 + 3 * 2

First, I multiply:

3 * 2 = 6

Now, I add:

5 + 6 = 11

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think that I should do the addition and multiplication from left to right. So I would do 5 + 2 to get 7, and then I would multiply that result by 4 to get 28. But I've been told that this is not always the correct way to do it, and that there is a rule called PEMDAS that tells you to do certain operations before others. I'm not sure what that means, so I'll just go with my first instinct and do the operations from left to right.

The answer is 28."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Well, I don't know about any special rules like PEMDAS, but I do know that multiplication and addition are both basic operations in math. When there's no specific order to follow, I learned that you should do the operations from left to right. 

So, first, I'll do the multiplication on the left: 7 times 2 equals 14. 

Then, I'll do the addition: 14 (the result from the first multiplication) plus 8 times 5. Doing the second multiplication, 8 times 5 equals 40. 

Finally, I'll do the addition: 14 plus 40 equals 54.

The answer is 54."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will solve this problem step by step.

First, I will multiply 4 and 3, which equals 12.

Then, I will add 2 to the result of the multiplication, since there are no other operations with higher priority.

So, 4 * 3 + 2 equals 12 + 2, which further simplifies to 14.

The answer is 14."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Hi! I'm a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS) yet. But, let's try to solve this step by step:

1. I see some numbers with addition and subtraction inside parentheses, so I'll start there: 2 + 5 equals 7.
2. Now the equation looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3
3. I can do the multiplication next, right? So, 4 * 7 equals 28 and 2 * 3 equals 6.
4. Now the equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6
5. I can do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 equals 40, and then 40 - 6 equals 34.

The answer is 34. (Without knowledge of the order of operations, I still arrived at the correct answer because the problem did not require the use of the order of operations to solve it correctly.)"

4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3

Then, I'll multiply 4 by 7:

28 + 12 - 2 * 3

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations, I would first think of doing the addition and multiplication from left to right. So I would add 5 and 2 to get 7, then multiply that result by 4.

So, 5 + 2 * 4 = 7 * 4.

But some bigger kids told me there's a special rule for this, called the order of operations or ""PEMDAS"" (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction). According to this rule, I should do the multiplication before the addition.

So, I should first multiply 2 by 4 to get 8, then add 5 to get the final answer.

First, I'll do the two multiplication parts:
7 * 2 = 14 and 8 * 5 = 40

Now, I have two numbers: 14 and 40. I should add them up according to what my teacher said.

14 + 40 = 54

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't know much about order of operations. But I know that if I do the multiplication first and then the addition, I get the answer. So, I would do 4 times 3 first, which is 12, and then add 2. When I do that, I get 12 plus 2, which equals 14.

The answer is 14."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Okay, as a elementary school student, I don't really know about the order of operations. But I remember my teacher saying something about ""parentheses first"". So let's follow that rule.

First, we solve the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.

So the expression becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, let's do the multiplication and addition from left to right: 4 times 7 equals 28, and 28 plus 12 equals 40.

Now, the expression looks like this: 40 - 2 * 3

Again, following the rule, let's do the remaining multiplication: 2 times 3 equals 6, and then we subtract that from 40.

So, 40 minus 6 equals 34.

The answer is 34."
