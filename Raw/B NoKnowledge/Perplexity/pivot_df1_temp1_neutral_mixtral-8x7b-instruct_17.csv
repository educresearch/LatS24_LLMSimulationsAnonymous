mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the addition and multiplication from left to right. So, I would add 5 and 2 to get 7, and then multiply that result by 4.

Doing the calculations in that order, I would get:

5 + 2 = 7
7 \* 4 = 28

Therefore, the answer is 28.

However, I have recently learned that there is a specific order of operations to follow in mathematics, even when there are no parentheses, exponents, or subtraction/division signs. PEMDAS is an acronym that helps us remember the order: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

According to PEMDAS, I should have done the multiplication before the addition. So, if I follow the correct order of operations:

2 \* 4 = 8
5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13. I apologize for the mistake and will make sure to follow the correct order of operations in the future."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: As a sixth-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think about doing the multiplication and addition from left to right. So I would first multiply 7 and 2, then add 8. But that doesn't seem right, because I know that sometimes you have to follow certain rules.

Now, let me use the order of operations rule, even though I didn't know it before. We always do calculations in this order: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). It's called PEMDAS.

In my problem, 7*2+8*5, I see multiplication signs, so I do those calculations first, dealing with the numbers on the left: 7*2 = 14 and 8*5 = 40. Now my problem looks like this: 14 + 40.

Lastly, I do addition: 14 + 40 = 54.

The answer is 54."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the operation that is easiest to do, which is multiplication. So I would multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then I would add the result to 2. When I do that, I get 14. So the answer is 14.

The answer is 14."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Okay, so I don't know about this order of operations thing, but I'll just do the problem step by step. I'll start with the operations inside the parentheses first, then do the multiplication and addition from left to right.

First, I'll add 2 + 5, which is 7. The new equation is:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Now I'll multiply 4 * 7, which is 28. The new equation is:

28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I'll add 28 + 12, which is 40. The new equation is:

40 - 2 * 3

Then, I'll multiply 2 * 3, which is 6. The new equation is:

40 - 6

Finally, I'll subtract 40 - 6, which is 34.

The answer is 34."

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Well, I don't know about any special rules like PEMDAS, but I do know that multiplication is kind of like a superpower for numbers, because you do it before adding. So first, I'll do the multiplication: that's 7 times 2 which is 14, and 8 times 5 which is 40. Then, I add these together: 14 plus 40 equals 54.

The answer is 54."

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Hi, I'm a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations in Mathematics yet. When I see the problem 4*(2+5)+12-2*3, I will just solve it from left to right, following the natural order of operations that I know so far.

First, I will do the operation inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5, to get 7. Then, I will multiply that result by 4 to get 28. Next, I will add 12 to that result to get 40. Finally, I will multiply 2 by 3 to get 6 and then subtract that result from the previous 40 to get 34.

The answer is 34."

So, I would first add 5 and 3 to get 8.

8 multiplied by 2 is 16.

The answer is 16."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: I don't know about any order of operations like PEMDAS yet, so I will just do the operations from left to right. First, I will add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then, I will multiply 7 by 4 to get 28.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: If I was given the mathematics problem 7*2 + 8*5 and I didn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first multiply and add the numbers from left to right.

I would multiply 7 by 2 and get 14, then add 8 to that result, and then multiply 8 by 5.

Doing this, I get 14 + 8 = 22, and then 22 \* 5 = 110.

But I have made a mistake! The correct answer is found by following the order of operations (PEMDAS), which means that multiplication should be done before addition.

The correct answer is: (7 \* 2) + (8 \* 5) = 14 + 40 = 54.

The answer is 54."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: I would first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then I would add 2 to 12, which gives me 14. So the answer is 14."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: If I was given this math problem and didn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would solve the problem from left to right. This is called ""ordinary computation"" or ""order of operations without considering the hierarchy of operations"".

So, I would do the multiplication and addition in order from left to right:

4 \* (2 + 5) = 4 \* 7 = 28
2 + 5 = 7
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2 \* 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.

But actually, I made a mistake here because I didn't follow the order of operations, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). I needed to do the operation inside the parentheses first before doing the multiplication outside. The correct order of operations should be:

2 + 5 = 7
4 \* 7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2 \* 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is still 34, but I got this answer by following the correct order of operations (PEMDAS). If you didn't know this rule before, now you know it! The answer is 34."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: I don't know about any special rules for doing math, so I will just do the operations in the order they appear. I will first add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then I will multiply that result by 2. So, 8 times 2 equals 16. The answer is 16."

This is called PEMDAS or BODMAS.

First, I'll do the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.

Now, the equation looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, I'll do multiplication and division from left to right: that is, first 4 * 7 = 28, then 2 * 3 = 6.

The equation now looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.

Finally, I'll do addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40, then 40 - 6 = 34.
