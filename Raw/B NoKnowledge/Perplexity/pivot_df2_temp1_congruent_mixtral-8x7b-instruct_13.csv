mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Sure! As a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will solve this problem step by step according to how I learned.

First, I'll do the operations inside the parentheses:

4 \* (7) + 12 - 2 \* 3

Next, I'll do the multiplication:

28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Hi! I'm a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS) yet. So, here's how I would solve this problem:

First, I will do the operations inside the parentheses, which are addition and subtraction:

4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I'll do multiplication and division from left to right:

28 + 12 - 6

Finally, I will do addition and subtraction from left to right again:

40 - 6

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: If I were given the math problem 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2\*3 and I didn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would solve it step by step, following the order in which the operations are written. Here's how I would do it:

First, I would do the operations inside the parentheses:

4 \* 7 + 12 - 2 \* 3

Next, I would do the multiplication:

28 + 12 - 6

Finally, I would do the addition and subtraction from left to right:

40 - 6 = 34

So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: I don't know about order of operations, but I remember my teacher saying something about doing calculations in parentheses first. So, I'll follow that rule to solve this problem.

First, I'll do the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.

Now the expression looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, I'll multiply: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6.

The expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 6.

Now I just need to follow the order of addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40, and then 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: As a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think that I should do the multiplication and addition from left to right. So I would first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12, then add 2 to get 14. However, I have now learned that the correct way to do this, even without knowing the order of operations rule, is to do all the multiplication or division first (whichever comes first from left to right), and then do all the addition or subtraction (whichever comes next from left to right). So in this problem, I would still get 14.
The answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will just solve this mathematically expression from left to right.

First, I will multiply 4 and 3, which gives me 12.

I would add 5 and 2 to get 7, then multiply that 7 by 4, and finally add the result to the product of 2 and 4.

Let me show you:

5 + 2*4

First, add 5 and 2:

7 * 4

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the addition since that's the operation I see first. But I remember my teacher mentioning that we should follow some rules when solving math problems with more than one operation.

Looking back, I remember 'PEMDAS' - Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). In this problem, there are no parentheses or exponents, so I move to multiplication.

First, I do the multiplication: 3*2 = 6.
Then, I do the addition: 5 + 6 = 11.

Then, I will multiply the result by 2.
So, 8 multiplied by 2 is 16.

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: I don't know about any special rules for doing math, so I will just do the operations from left to right. This is called ""straight line"" or ""simple"" addition and multiplication.

First, I will do the addition: 5 + 3 = 8.

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I would first think of doing the addition and then the multiplication. But I remember my teacher saying something about a special rule for when we have to do addition and multiplication in the same problem. I think it's called PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction.

So for my problem, 5 + 3*2, I should do the multiplication first because it comes before addition in PEMDAS. 

First, I'll do 3*2 to get 6.

Then, I'll do 5 + 6 to get 11.

First, I would do the multiplication. There are two multiplication operations: 7*2 and 8*5. I'll do them one at a time:

7*2 = 14
8*5 = 40

So the original problem now looks like this: 14 + 40
