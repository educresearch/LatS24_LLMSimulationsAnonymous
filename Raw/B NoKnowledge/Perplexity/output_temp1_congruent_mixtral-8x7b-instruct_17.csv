At first glance, this problem looks a bit confusing because it has addition, subtraction, and multiplication all mixed together. But I know that I can do the operations inside the parentheses first. So I'll start by adding 2 + 5, which equals 7.

Now the problem looks like this: 4 \* 7 + 12 - 2 \* 3.

Next, I see that there are still some multiplication and addition left to do. I don't know about order of operations yet, so I'll just do the multiplication and addition from left to right.

First, I'll do 4 \* 7, which equals 28.

Now the problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2 \* 3.

Next, I'll do the addition, which gives me 40.

Now the problem looks like this: 40 - 2 \* 3.

Finally, I'll do the remaining multiplication, which is 2 \* 3, which equals 6.

Now the problem looks like this: 40 - 6.

To finish up, I'll do subtraction, which gives me 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34."

So I would first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12, then add 2 to get 14.

So the answer is 14."

First, I'll do the addition and subtraction inside the parentheses:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Then, I'll do the multiplication:

28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, I'll do addition and subtraction from left to right:

40 - 6

The answer is 34."
