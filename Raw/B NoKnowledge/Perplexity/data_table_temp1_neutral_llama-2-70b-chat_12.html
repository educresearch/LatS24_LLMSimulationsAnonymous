      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem. I don't know what PEMDAS means or how it helps us solve math problems. Can you explain it to me?<br><br>Oh, you want me to try and solve it anyway? Okay, I'll do my best.<br><br>So, the first thing I see is the 4* part. That means we have to multiply 4 by something. The something is 2+5. I'm not sure what that is yet, but I know I need to find out.<br><br>Okay, 2+5 is 7. So, 4*7 is... umm... 28? No, that's not right. 28 is too big. Let me think... Okay, I know! 4*7 is 28!<br><br>Wait, what's that? There's a plus sign? And a 12? Oh, I see! So, 4*(2+5)+12 means we have to add 12 to whatever we just found.<br><br>Okay, so we found 28, and now we add 12, that's... hmm... 40!<br><br>But wait, there's a minus sign! And a 2*3! Oh no, I don't know what that means either!<br><br>Umm... I think we have to find 2*3 first? That's... umm... 6? No, that's not right. 6 is too small. Let me think... Oh, I know! 2*3 is 9!<br><br>So, 4*(2+5)+12-2*3 means we have to subtract 9 from 40.<br><br>Okay, 40 - 9 =... hmm... 31!<br><br>The answer is 31.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. I'll just do my best!<br><br>First, I'll multiply 4 by 2+5. That's 4 times 7, which is 28.<br><br>Then, I'll add 12 to 28. That's 40.<br><br>Last, I'll subtract 2 times 3 from 40. That's 40 - 6, which is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, let me try to solve this problem!<br><br>First, I see some parentheses, so I need to do what's inside them first. That's 2+5, which is 7.<br><br>Next, I have 4 times 7, which is 28.<br><br>Then, I see 12. I don't know what to do with it yet, so I'll just leave it alone for now.<br><br>After that, I have 2 times 3, which is 6.<br><br>Finally, I have to subtract 6 from 28, which gives me 22.<br><br>The answer is 22!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, let's see...<br><br>First, we need to do the stuff inside the parentheses. That's 2+5, which is 7.<br><br>Next, we multiply 4 by 7, which is 28.<br><br>Then, we add 12 to 28, which is 40.<br><br>Finally, we subtract 2 times 3, which is 6.<br><br>So, the final answer is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what this "PEMDAS" thing is, but I know that when you have numbers and operations in a question, you're supposed to follow some rules to get the right answer.<br><br>So, let's see... we have 4, 3, and 2. We need to do something with them. Hmmm... I know! Let's start by multiplying 4 and 3. That gives us 12.<br><br>Okay, now we have 12 and 2. We need to add 2 to 12. That gives us 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.<br><br>(I hope that's right! I'm not really sure what I'm doing, but it sounds like it could be right, right?)</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hi there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this problem.<br><br>First, I see a multiplication sign, so I know I need to multiply 4 and 3. That gives me 12.<br><br>Next, I see a plus sign, so I add 2 to 12. That gives me 14.<br><br>So, the answer is 14.<br><br>I hope that's right! Can you tell me if I did it correctly?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...<br><br>Okay, I know I have to follow some rules when doing math. I think it's like, do the things inside the parentheses first, then do the exponents, and then do the multiplication and division from left to right. And then, finally, do the addition and subtraction from left to right.<br><br>So, for this problem, I'd do the multiplication first: 4*3 = 12.<br><br>Then, I'd do the addition: 12 + 2 = 14.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! So, I know I need to do multiplication before addition, that's what my teacher told me.<br><br>First, I multiply 4 and 3, that's 12.<br><br>Then, I add 2 to 12, that's 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. I think it has something to do with a special way of doing math problems. Can you help me?<br><br>Okay, let me think...if I just follow the numbers, it would be 5 + 2 = 7 and then 7 * 4 = 28. But that's not the right way to do it, is it?<br><br>Oh, I know! I think I need to do the multiplication first. So, 2 * 4 = 8. Now, 5 + 8 = 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...<br><br>Okay, so I know that when we add numbers, we have to do it in a specific order. Like, if we have 2 apples and we add 3 more apples, we get 5 apples.<br><br>In this problem, we have 5 and 2. The 2 is multiplied by 4, so that's like having 2 groups of 4 things. That's like having 8 things altogether!<br><br>So, if we add 5 and 8, we get... (counting on fingers) 13!<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, let's see... 5 + 2 is 7, and 7 * 4 is 28. So, 5 + 2*4 is 28. The answer is 28.</td>
