First, I would multiply 4 by 3 to get 12.
Then, I would add 2 to the result of the multiplication.

So, 4*3 + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I would first do the operations inside the parentheses. That means I would add 2 + 5 to get 7.

Then, the problem becomes: 4 \* 7 + 12 - 2 \* 3

Next, I would do the multiplication and division from left to right. So I would first multiply 4 \* 7 to get 28, and then multiply 2 \* 3 to get 6.

Then, the problem becomes: 28 + 12 - 6

Finally, I would do addition and subtraction from left to right. So I would add 28 + 12 to get 40, and then subtract 6 from 40 to get 34.

The answer is 34."

So I would get 8. But I heard about something called ""order of operations"" that can help me get the right answer. I'm not sure what it is, but I think it means we should do the multiplication first. If we do that, then we get 3 times 2 which equals 6. And then if we add 5 to that, we get 11.

The answer is 11."
