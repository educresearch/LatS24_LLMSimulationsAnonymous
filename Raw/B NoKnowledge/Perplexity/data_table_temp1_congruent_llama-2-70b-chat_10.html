      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>First, I see some numbers and signs that I know how to work with. I'll start by following the order in which things are written. So, I'll do the multiplication first: 4 \* 2 = 8.<br><br>Then, I see a plus sign, so I'll add 5 to 8: 8 + 5 = 13.<br><br>Next, I see another plus sign, so I'll add 12 to 13: 13 + 12 = 25.<br><br>Finally, I see a minus sign and a multiplication sign. I'll subtract 2 times 3 from 25: 25 - 6 = 19.<br><br>The answer is 19.<br><br>I hope that's correct! Can you tell me if I did something wrong or if there's a better way to solve it?</td>

I think we are supposed to follow some rules, but I'm not sure what they are.<br><br>I think we are supposed to do the multiplication first, so I will start by multiplying 4 and 2+5. That gives me 4*7 = 28.<br><br>Next, I think we are supposed to add 12. So, 28 + 12 = 40.<br><br>Finally, I think we are supposed to subtract 2 times 3, which is 6.
