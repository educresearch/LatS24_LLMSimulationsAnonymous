llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Hmm, okay, let me think about this...

First, I know that the multiplication symbol, which looks like a big cross, comes before the addition symbol, which looks like a little plus sign. So, I think I need to do the multiplication part first.

2*4 is equal to 8.

Now, I need to add 5 to 8, which gives me 13.

The answer is 13.

Can you please tell me if that's correct?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll give it my best shot!

Okay, so we have 7*2 + 8*5. I know that multiplication comes before addition, so let's start with the multiplication.

7*2 is equal to 14.

Next, we have 8*5, which is equal to 40.

Now, we add 14 and 40 together, which gives us 54.

So, the answer is 54!

I hope that's correct! Can someone please tell me what this PEMDAS thing is all about now? ðŸ˜…

The answer is 54."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think... Ok, I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll do the multiplication first. 4 times 3 is 12. Then, I'll add 2 to 12, which makes it 14.

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not really sure about this order of operations thing. But I'll give it my best shot!

Okay, so I see a bunch of numbers and symbols here. Let's start with the multiplication. I know that's the first thing we're supposed to do. So, 4 times 2 plus 5 is... hmm... 4 times 2 is 8, and then plus 5 is 13.

Next, I see a plus sign! That means I have to add something. So, 12 plus 13 is... um... 25!

Now, there's a minus sign. Oh no! That means I have to subtract something. Let's see... 25 minus 2 times 3 is... hmm... 25 minus 6 is 19.

So, the answer is 19! Woohoo, I did it!

The answer is 19."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Okay, so we have this math problem: 5 + 3*2.

First, I think we should do the multiplication because it's supposed to be done first, right? So, 3 times 2 is 6.

Now, we have 5 + 6, which is 11.

The answer is 11."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do the operations in a special order, but I don't know what that order is. I think it's like, do the multiplication first, then the addition? So, let's see... 2 times 4 is 8, then plus 5 is... hmm, that's a tricky one. I think it's 13. The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

Okay, so we have 7*2 + 8*5. Let's start by multiplying 7 and 2, that's 14. Then we multiply 8 and 5, that's 40.

Now, we add 14 and 40, that's 54.

The answer is 54.

I hope that's right! Can someone please tell me what this PEMDAS thing is all about?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Okay, I'm trying my best here! So, 4*3 means we have to multiply 4 and 3, which gives us 12. Then we have +2, which means we add 2 to 12, so that gives us 14.

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm trying to solve this math problem, and I'm not really sure how to do it. I know it's got something to do with this PEMDAS thingy, but I don't really understand what that means. Can you help me out?

Okay, so the problem is 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3. I think I need to do the multiplication first, so that's 4*7, right? That's 28. Then, I need to add 12, which is 40. Okay, so far I have 40.

Now, I need to do the subtraction. I need to subtract 2 times 3, which is 6. So, 40 - 6 is 34.

The answer is 34.

I hope that's right! Can you tell me if I did it correctly?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm trying to solve this math problem, 5 + 3*2. I'm not sure what this * thing means, but I think it might have something to do with multiplication.

So, I'm gonna start by adding 5 and 3, which gives me 8. Then, I'm gonna multiply 3 by 2, which gives me 6.

Now, I'm not sure what to do next. I think I'm supposed to add 8 and 6, but I'm not sure. I hope that's right!

Okay, so I added 8 and 6, and I got 14. I think that's the right answer!

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

First, I know that the * symbol means multiply, so I'll do that part first.
2*4 = 8

Next, I see a + sign, so I'll add 5 and 8.
5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Hmmm, let me think...

Okay, I know I have to multiply the numbers together, but I'm not sure which ones to do first. I think I'll do the multiplication that has the biggest numbers first.

So, 8*5 is bigger than 7*2, so I'll do that one first. 8*5 = 40.

Now, I have to do 7*2. 7*2 = 14.

Adding 40 and 14 together gives me... 54!

The answer is 54."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to follow some rules to solve this problem, but I don't know what they are yet. Hmm... let me think.

Well, first I see a bunch of numbers, so I'll just start by adding them up. So, 4 + 3 is 7, and then there's a 2 at the end, so that's 7 + 2, which is 9!

The answer is 9."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this problem for a bit!

Okay, first let's start with the multiplication part. We have 4 times something, and that something is 2 plus 5. That's 2+5, which equals 7! So, 4 times 7 is 28.

Now, we have some addition and subtraction left. Let's see... we have 12 plus 28, that's 40. But then we have 2 times 3, that's 6. So, we subtract 6 from 40, and that gives us 34.

The answer is 34!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think... Ok, I know that when you have a lot of numbers and symbols in a math problem, you have to follow some rules to figure out what to do first. I think it's like a recipe for cooking, you have to do certain steps in a certain order or it won't turn out right.

So, in this problem, I see that there's a 5 and a 3, and then a star that means multiplication. I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll do the multiplication first.

3*2 is equal to 6.

Now, I have 5 + 6, and I know that 5 + 6 is equal to 11.

The answer is 11."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, right? So, 2 times 4 is 8. Then, I add 5 to 8 and I get 13. The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Okay, so we have two numbers, 7 and 2, and we need to multiply them together. That gives us 14.

Then, we have another two numbers, 8 and 5, and we need to multiply them together. That gives us 40.

Next, we need to add 14 and 40 together. That gives us 54.

So, the answer is 54.

The answer is 54."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Okay! So, we have this problem: 4*3 + 2.

First, let's do the multiplication. 4 times 3 is 12.

Now, we add 2 to 12. 12 + 2 is 14.

So, the answer is 14!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Okay, let's see...

First, we have the part that says 4 times something. That's easy! 4 times 2 is 8, and 4 times 5 is 20. So, 4 times 2 plus 5 is 8 + 20, which is 28.

Next, we have the plus sign. That means we add some numbers. We have 12, and then we have 2 times 3, which is 6. So, 12 plus 6 is 18.

Lastly, we have the minus sign. That means we subtract one number from another. We have 18 minus 2, which is 16.

Therefore, the answer is 16.

The answer is 16."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Okay, so we have this math problem: 5 + 3*2.

First, let's start with the multiplication. 3*2 is equal to 6.

Now, we add 5 and 6, which gives us 11.

The answer is 11."
