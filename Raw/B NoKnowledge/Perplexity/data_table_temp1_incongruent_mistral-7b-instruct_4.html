      <td>GPT Response: I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to do here, but I think I've heard about something called order of operations. I guess it's like rules for solving math problems. Let's see if I can figure out this one:<br><br>1. The first operation is multiplication, so I'll do that first: 4 * 3 = 12<br>2.

      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to answer this question as I'm just an elementary school student and I don't know about order of operations (PEMDAS) yet. But none the less, I'll try to solve it. I think we should do the multiplication first because it comes before addition according to the rules I've heard. So, I'll do 4 times 3 which equals 12. Then I add 2 to 12 which gives me the final answer.<br><br>The answer is 14. (But in reality, the answer is actually 13 according to the order of operations rules. This is a common mistake for beginners, doing the multiplication and then adding which results in carrying over a digit or making the problem more complicated. So, 13 is the correct answer)</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmmm, this looks like a fun math problem! I see numbers and some symbols, but I'm not sure what they mean yet. Let's try to figure it out step by step.<br><br>First, I see the number 4 with a tiny star (*) next to it. I think that means I should do something with the number 3 that's next to it. But what? Let's give it a try and see if it makes sense.<br><br>So, I'll do the * symbol thing, and that means I'll get 12 (4 multiplied by 3).<br><br>Now, I have the number 12 and the + symbol next to 2.

      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations in mathematics, which is often represented by the acronym PEMDAS. However, I've heard that certain mathematical operations should be done in a specific order to get the correct answer.<br><br>Let me try to solve the given expression, 5 + 2 * 4, based on a reasonable-looking order, which I believe is to do multiplication before addition.<br><br>So, the first step would be to do the multiplication: 2 * 4 = 8<br><br>Next, add the number that was originally outside of the multiplication sign: 5 + 8<br><br>Now, do the addition: 5 + 8 = 13<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

But, this might not be the correct answer according to the order of operations rule (PEMDAS), which states that multiplication and division should be done before addition and subtraction.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just an elementary school student, so I don't really understand this "order of operations" thing you're talking about. But let me try to solve this problem with some common sense:<br><br>First, I see that there's addition and multiplication in this expression. I guess I should do the multiplication first because I learned that you can't add numbers until you know what each Addend is. So, let's do 2 * 4: that's 8.<br><br>Now, with this new number, I can add 5: 5 + 8. That makes 13.<br><br>So, the answer is: The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, according to what I've learned so far in elementary school, we usually do addition and subtraction before we do multiplication and division. But, in this case, there's only addition and multiplication. Hmm... Let me try a simple approach without any fancy rules, it might work this time. So, I'll do the multiplication first that is, 2 * 4, which equals 8. Then, I'll do the addition, which is 5 + 8.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just a kid and I don't know much about the rules for solving math problems, but I think maybe we should do the multiplication first because the asterisk (star) symbol looks like it means "times," and then do the addition after that.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I see some numbers and some signs. I think I need to follow some rules to find the answer.
