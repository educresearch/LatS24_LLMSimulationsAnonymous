      <td>GPT Response: Okay! Let me try my best to solve this problem.<br><br>First, I see some numbers that are inside parentheses, so I need to follow the rule that says "Do whatever is inside the parentheses first!"<br><br>Inside the parentheses, I see 2+5. Let me see... 2+5 is equal to 7.<br><br>Now, I see 4 times 7, that's 28.<br><br>Next, I see 12. That's easy, 12 is just 12!<br><br>Finally, I see 2 times 3. That's 6.<br><br>Now, I need to do some subtracting. 28 - 6 is equal to 22.<br><br>The answer is 22!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm trying to solve this math problem, and I'm not sure what to do. It looks like this: 4*(2+5)+12-2*3.<br><br>First, I think I should follow the order of operations. That means I should do anything that's inside parentheses first. So, I'll start by adding 2 and 5, which gives me 7.<br><br>Next, I'll multiply 4 by 7, which gives me 28.<br><br>Then, I'll add 12 to 28, which gives me 40.<br><br>Finally, I'll subtract 2 times 3, which gives me 40 - 6, which is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.<br><br>I hope that's right! Can someone please check my work?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, wow! That's a tricky question! Let me think...<br><br>Okay, first, we have 4 times 2 plus 5, that's 4 times 7, which is 28.<br><br>Then, we have 12. That's easy!<br><br>Next, we have 2 times 3. That's 6.<br><br>Now, we have to subtract 6 from 28. That's... hmm... 22!<br><br>The answer is 22!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, let's see...<br><br>First, we have 4 times something, and that something is 2+5. That's 2 plus 5, which is 7. So, 4 times 7 is 28.<br><br>Next, we have 12. That's just a number, so we can't do anything to it. It's just 12.<br><br>After that, we have minus 2 times 3. That's 2 times 3, which is 6. But then we have to subtract 6 from 28, and that gives us 22.<br><br>So, the answer is 22.<br><br>The answer is 22.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...<br><br>Okay, I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 3. That gives me 12.<br><br>Then, I have 2 left over, so I'll add that to 12.<br><br>The answer is 14.<br><br>Can you help me check if that's right?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a 6th grader and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>So, the first thing I see is the multiplication sign, which means I have to multiply 4 and 3. That gives me 12.<br><br>Next, I see the plus sign, and I know that means I have to add something. In this case, it's 2. So, I add 2 to 12 and get 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.<br><br>PEMDAS? Never heard of it! But I hope that's the right answer! ðŸ˜…</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I know that when we do math, we usually start with the numbers that are multiplied together. So, I think we should start by multiplying 4 and 3 together. That gives us 12. Then, we add 2 to 12, and that gives us 14. So, the answer is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know that when we have lots of numbers and symbols in a math problem, we need to follow some rules to make sure we do the right operations in the right order. I think it's like a recipe for cooking, we need to follow the steps in the right order or it won't turn out right!<br><br>So, the first thing I do is look for any multiplication symbols, and I see that there's a 4 and a 3 multiplied together. That means I need to do that first, so I multiply 4 and 3 and get 12.<br><br>Next, I look for any addition symbols, and I see that there's a plus sign between the 12 and the 2. So, I add 12 and 2 and get 14.<br><br>That's it! The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I can give it a try!<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I would do is add 5 and 3, because that's what the problem says.

      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll give it my best shot!<br><br>So, 5+3*2 means we have to add 5 and 3 times 2, right? That's what the multiplication symbol means, doesn't it?<br><br>Okay, so 3 times 2 is 6. Now, we add 5 and 6, which gives us 11.<br><br>The answer is 11!</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, but I don't know why. It just says so in the question. So, I'll do 3*2 and that's 6. Then, I'll add 5 and 6 and that's 11. The answer is 11.</td>
