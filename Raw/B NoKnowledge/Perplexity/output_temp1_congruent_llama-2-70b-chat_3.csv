Okay, so I know that when we multiply numbers, we need to do it in a special order. First, we multiply the numbers that are close together, and then we add them up.

So, in this problem, I think we should multiply 7 and 2 first, because they are next to each other. That gives us 14.

Then, we need to multiply 8 and 5. That gives us 40.

Now, we add 14 and 40 together, and we get 54.

The answer is 54!"

First, we have 2 + 5, and that equals 7.

Next, we have 4 times 7, and that equals 28.

After that, we have 12.

Last, we have 2 times 3, and that equals 6.

Now, we subtract 6 from 28, and that gives us 22.

The answer is 22."
