mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: As a 6th grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think about doing the addition and multiplication from left to right. 

So I would add 5 and 2 to get 7, then multiply that result by 4.

7 times 4 equals 28.

The answer is 28."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Okay, so if I was in 6th grade and didn't know about the order of operations, I would just solve this math problem from left to right. It's like when you read words, you start from the left and move to the right. So I would first multiply 7 by 2, then add 8 times 5.

7 x 2 = 14
14 + 8 x 5 = 14 + 40

Next, I would multiply 40 and 14 since those are the next numbers in the problem.

14 + 40 = 54

So, the answer is:

The answer is 54."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will answer this by doing the operations from left to right. 

First, I will multiply 4 and 3, which equals 12. 

Next, I will add the result to 2. So it's 12 plus 2, which equals 14.

The answer is 14."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: I don't know about any order of operations rule, but I can still try to solve this problem. I will just do the operations from left to right.

First, I will do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.

Then, I will multiply that result by 4: 4 \* 7 = 28.

Next, I will do the subtraction: 28 - 12 = 16.

Lastly, I will multiply: 16 \* 3 = 48.

So, the answer is 48."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the addition part since that's what I see first. But I remember my teacher telling me that it's important to follow certain rules to get the correct answer.

So, even though I really want to add 5 and 3 together, I should do the multiplication part first. That's because when there's both addition and multiplication, you should always do the multiplication first.

Doing the multiplication (3*2), I get 6.

Now, I can do the addition (5+6), which gives me 11.

The answer is 11."

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Well, I'm a 6th-grader and I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS). But I think you can do the multiplication and addition in any order you want, just like when you're adding numbers.

So let's see, I can do the first multiplication: 7 times 2 is 14.
And then, I can do the other multiplication: 8 times 5 is 40.
Then, I add those results: 14 plus 40 gives me 54.

The answer is 54."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Well, Hi there! I'm a grade 6 student who doesn't know about order of operations (PEMDAS). To solve this problem, I think we should do the multiplication first because that's what we usually learn to do early on. So:

4 (three 4s because 4*3) = 12
Then, add 2 to that result.

So, 12 + 2 equals 14.

The answer is 14."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Hi, I'm a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations in mathematics yet. When I see a math problem like this: 4*(2+5)+12-2*3, I don't know that I'm supposed to follow the PEMDAS rule. But, I can still solve this problem step by step.

First, I would do the operations inside the parentheses, so 2 + 5 equals 7. Now my equation looks like this: 4*7 + 12 - 2*3.

Next, I would do the multiplication, so 4*7 equals 28 and 2*3 equals 6. Now my equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.

Finally, I would do the addition and subtraction from left to right, so 28 + 12 equals 40 and 40 - 6 equals 34.

The answer is 34."

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: I don't know about any order of operations or PEMDAS. I just see numbers and operations here. So, I would do the multiplication and addition from left to right.

First, I'll do 7 times 2, which is 14. Then, I'll do 8 times 5, which is 40. After that, I'll add the results together:

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+2*4,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations, I would first think about doing addition and multiplication from left to right. So I would first add 5 and 2 to get 7, and then multiply that 7 by 4. If I do the multiplication next, I get 28, so the answer is 28.

But actually, I just found out that there's something called the order of operations that I need to follow: parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), addition and subtraction (from left to right). So for this problem, I should do the multiplication before the addition. That means I should multiply 2 by 4 to get 8, and then add 5 to get 13.

The answer is 13."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Well, I don't know much about order of operations, but I remember my teacher saying something about multiplying and dividing before adding and subtracting. So let's do that. 

First, I'll multiply 7 by 2 and 8 by 5. That gives me 14 and 40.

Now, I'll add those results together because the plus sign tells me to do addition next. So, 14 plus 40 equals 54.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: I don't know much about order of operations, but I remember my teacher saying something about ""PEMDAS"" which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, let's do the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.
So the expression becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we do multiplication and division from left to right: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6.
So the expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, we do addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40 and 40 - 6 = 34.
