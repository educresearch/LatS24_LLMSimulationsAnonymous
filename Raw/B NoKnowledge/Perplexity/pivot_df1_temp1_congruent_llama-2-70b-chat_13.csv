llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

First, I know that the star symbol means we have to multiply, so I'll do that part first.
2 times 4 is equal to 8.

Now, we have 5 plus 8, which is equal to 13.

So, the answer is 13.

The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. But I think we're supposed to follow some rules to figure out the answer. So, let me try my best!

First, I think we should do the multiplication part. That means we need to find 7*2 and 8*5. Hmm... 7*2 is 14, and 8*5 is 40.

Now, I'm not sure what to do next. I think we need to add 14 and 40 together, so that's 54. But I'm not sure if that's right.

The answer is 54.

I hope that's correct! Can someone please tell me if I did it right?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm just a grade 6 student, and I'm not too sure about this order of operations thingy. But I'll give it my best shot.

Okay, so the problem is 4*3 + 2. I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 3. That gives me 12.

Next, I have to add 2 to 12. That's easy, and I get 14.

So, the answer is 14!

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll give it my best shot!

Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4* thingy. I think that means I have to multiply 4 and 2 + 5. That's easy, it's like, 4 x 7, which is 28.

Next, there's this plus sign (+) and it's followed by 12. I think that means I have to add 12 to 28. That's simple, 28 + 12 = 40.

Oh, wait! There's a minus sign (-) and it's followed by 2 times 3. That means I have to subtract 6 from 40. That's easy, 40 - 6 = 34.

So, the answer is 34!

The answer is 34."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that the multiplication symbol, the asterisk, is like a special kind of addition. So, if I have 3*2, that means I'm adding 3 groups of 2 together. That's like saying 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7!

And then there's the 5. I know I have to add that to the 7 too. So, 7 + 5 = 12!

The answer is 12."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Hi! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll try my best to solve this math problem.

The problem is 5 + 2*4. I know that 2*4 is equal to 8, so I can write:

5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Okay, let me try to solve this problem!

First, I know that when we multiply numbers, we have to do it in a special order. So, I'll start by multiplying the 7 and the 2 together. That gives me 14.

Next, I'll multiply the 8 and the 5 together. That gives me 40.

Now, I need to add the two numbers together. So, I'll add 14 and 40, and that gives me 54.

The answer is 54!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But let's try to solve this math problem together!

Okay, so we have 4*3, that's 12, right? And then we have + 2, that's 14.

So, the answer is 14!

I hope that's correct! Can you tell me if I did it right? ðŸ˜Š

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

Okay, so the first thing I see is 4 times something. That's easy, I know my multiplication facts! 4 times 2 is 8, and 4 times 5 is 20. Adding them together gives me 28.

Next, I see a plus sign followed by 12. That means I add 12 to my previous answer, which is 28. So, my new answer is 40.

After that, I see a minus sign followed by 2 times 3. That means I have to subtract 6 from my previous answer. So, my final answer is 34.

The answer is 34."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Hi there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure how to solve this problem. Let me think about it for a moment...

Okay, I know that when we have addition and multiplication in a problem, we need to do the multiplication first. So, I'll start by multiplying 3 and 2, which gives me 6.

Now, I need to add 5 and 6. That's easy, it's just 11!

So, the answer is 11.

The answer is __11__."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I should do the multiplication first.

2*4 = 8

Now, I have 5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

First, I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll do the multiplication parts first.

7*2 = 14
8*5 = 40

Now, I add the two numbers together.

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Okay, so we have a big number, 4, and it's multiplying a smaller number, 3. That's like, 4 groups of 3 things, right? So, 4*3 is equal to 12.

And then, there's a plus sign, and it's telling us to add 2 to 12. So, 4*3 + 2 is equal to 14.

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what this stuff is about, but I'll try my best!

Okay, so the first thing I see is 4 and then some stuff inside the parentheses. I think we're supposed to do what's inside the parentheses first, so that's what I'll do.

Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5. Hmm... I know how to add! Let's see... 2 + 5 is... (thinking) 7!

Okay, so now we have 4 times 7. That's... (thinking) 28!

But wait, there's more! We have some more things to do. There's a plus sign and then 12. Oh, and then there's a minus sign and 2 times 3.

I think we're supposed to do the addition before the subtraction, so let's do the addition first. 28 + 12 is... (thinking) 40!

Now, we have to subtract 2 times 3. That's... (thinking) 6.

So, if we subtract 6 from 40, we get... (thinking) 34!

The answer is 34."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Hmm, okay, let me think...

So, we have 5 plus 3 times 2, right?

First, let's do the multiplication: 3 times 2 is 6.

Now, we add 5 and 6, and that gives us... 11!

The answer is 11."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, but I don't know why. I just know that's the way it is. So, I'll do the multiplication first.

2*4 = 8

Now, I add 5 to 8:

5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Okay! So, I know we have to do some math, but I'm not really sure how to do it. Let me think...

First, I think we should multiply 7 and 2 together. That gives us... (pauses to think) ...14!

Next, we need to multiply 8 and 5 together. That's... (pauses again) ...40!

Now, we need to add 14 and 40 together. That's... (pauses once more) ...54!

So, the answer is 54!

The answer is 54."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do multiplication before addition, but I don't know why. My teacher just told me that's how it works. So, I'm gonna do the multiplication first.

4 times 3 is 12.

Now, I have to add 2 to 12.

12 + 2 is 14.

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Okay! Let's see...

First, we have the part in parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7

Next, we multiply 4 by 7: 4*7 = 28

Then, we add 12: 28 + 12 = 40

Last, we subtract 2 times 3: 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Okay! So, we have 5 + 3*2. First, let's do the multiplication. 3*2 is equal to 6. Now, we add 5 and 6, which gives us 11. The answer is 11."
