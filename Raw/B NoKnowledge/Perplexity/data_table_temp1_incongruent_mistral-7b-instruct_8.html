So, let's just do the arithmetic from left to right, and I'll make sure to ask my teacher about PEMDAS soon.<br><br>First, I'll do the parentheses:<br>2 + 5 = 7<br>So, 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3 becomes:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br>= 28 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I'll do the multiplication:<br>2 * 3 = 6<br>So, 28 + 12 - 6 becomes:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br>= 28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Now, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right:<br>12 + 28 = 40<br>So, 40 - 6 becomes:<br><br>40 - 6<br>= 34<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I have not learned about the order of operations in mathematics yet. However, I can try to solve the problem by doing the operations inside the parentheses first, then the multiplication, and finally the addition and subtraction. Here's how I would attempt to solve the problem:<br><br>First, I would calculate the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Next, I would do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28<br><br>Then, I would do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40, and 40 - 2 * 3 = 38<br><br>So, the answer is 38. However, according to the order of operations rule, which I haven't learned yet, the correct answer is actually 41. But based on my elementary understanding of mathematics, I believe the answer is 38.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just a student in elementary school and I don't really know about this thing called order of operations yet. But I see some numbers and some symbols, so I'll try to do the calculation step by step.<br><br>First, let's do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7. Now we have: 4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, we do the multiplication: 4 * 7 equals 28 and 2 * 3 equals 6. Now the equation looks like: 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Then, I do the addition and subtraction from left to right. First, I add 12 and 28 which makes 40. Finally, I subtract 6 from 40 and get: 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

Since I don't know about things like "multiplication first" or "exponents before multiplication and division," I'll just do the operations from left to right as they appear.
