llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know I need to follow some rules to solve this problem. I think it's PEMDAS or something like that.

So, first, I need to do the parentheses. There aren't any parentheses in this problem, so I can skip that step.

Next, I need to do the exponents. There aren't any exponents in this problem either, so I can move on to the next step.

Now, I need to do the multiplication. Oh, there's a multiplication sign! I need to multiply 2 and 4. That's easy, it's 8.

Finally, I need to add 5 and 8. That's also easy, it's 13.

The answer is 13!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Hmm, okay, let me think about this...

So, we have two multiplication problems: 7 times 2 and 8 times 5.

I know that when you multiply numbers, you have to do it in a certain order. Like, if you have 2 groups of 3 things, and you want to know how many total things you have, you have to multiply 2 times 3 first, and then add the two products together.

So, in this problem, I think we should do the multiplication in this order: 7 times 2, then 8 times 5.

7 times 2 is 14.
8 times 5 is 40.

Then, we add 14 and 40 together, and that gives us... 54!

The answer is 54."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?

Okay, I think I know what to do! We need to follow some steps to solve this problem. First, we need to multiply 4 and 3, which gives us 12. Then, we need to add 2 to 12, which gives us 14.

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 multiplied by something. That something is 2+5, right? So, I think I should add 2 and 5 first. That's 7.

Now, I have 4 times 7, which is 28.

Next, I see a plus sign and a 12. I think that means I should add 12 to 28, so that's 40.

Oh, there's a minus sign and a 2 times 3. That's 6. I should subtract 6 from 40, right? That gives me 34.

The answer is 34.

I hope that's correct! Can someone please tell me what PEMDAS means now? ðŸ˜…"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?

Okay, I think I know how to do it now. Let me try...

First, I'll add 5 and 3, that's 8.
Then, I'll multiply 8 by 2, that's 16.

The answer is 16.

Is that right?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, um, I've been trying to figure out this math problem, and I'm not really sure how to do it. It's 5+2 Times 4. I know I'm supposed to follow some rules, but I don't really know what they are. Can you help me out?

Okay, so I think I should start by adding 5 and 2. That's easy, right? So, 5 + 2 = 7.

But then I'm supposed to multiply 2 by 4. That's a bit trickier. I know I need to do something with the numbers, but I'm not sure what. Can you give me a hint?

Oh, I think I get it now! I'm supposed to multiply 2 by 4, so that's 8.

So, the answer is 7 + 8 = 15.

The answer is 15."

Okay, so we have 7*2, that's 14. And then we have 8*5, that's 40. Now, we need to add them together. 14 + 40 = 54.

The answer is 54.

I hope that's correct! Can you tell me if I did it right?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. I think it might be a way of doing math problems, but I'm not sure. Can you help me?

Okay, so I know that 4 times 3 is 12. And then there's a plus sign, so I think that means I have to add something. But I don't know what to add because there's no number there. Oh wait, there's a 2! I think I'm supposed to add 2 to 12. So, 12 + 2 is 14.

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

Okay, so the first thing I see is 4 times 2 plus 5. That's easy, it's 8 plus 5, which is 13.

Next, I see 12 minus 2 times 3. That's 12 minus 6, which is 6.

So, the final answer is 13 + 6, which is 19.

The answer is 19."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm trying to solve this math problem, and I'm not really sure how to do it. I know I need to follow some rules, but I don't know what they are. I think I'm supposed to do the numbers inside the parentheses first, so I'll start by multiplying 3 and 2. That gives me 6. Then, I add 5 and 6, which is 11. The answer is 11!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know I have to follow some rules to solve this problem. I remember my teacher saying something about doing things in a special order.

First, I see a multiplication sign, so I know I have to do that part first. I multiply 2 and 4, and that gives me 8.

Next, I see a addition sign, so I add 5 and 8. That gives me 13.

The answer is 13!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Sure! Here's how I would answer the question:

""Okay, so we have 7*2, that's 14. Then we have 8*5, that's 40. So, we add 14 and 40, and that gives us... ummm... 54! The answer is 54.""

I know that's not the correct answer, but that's how I would answer it as an elementary school student who doesn't know about the order of operations yet. I would simply add the two numbers together without following any specific order."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 3. That gives me 12.

Next, I have 2 left over, so I'll add that to 12.

The answer is 14.

Can you check that for me, teacher?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it my best shot. Okay, so the first thing I see is 4 times 2, which is 8. Then there's a plus sign, and I add 5 to 8, which is 13. After that, there's another plus sign, and I add 12 to 13, which is 25. Finally, there's a minus sign, and I subtract 2 times 3 from 25, which is 21.

The answer is 21."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Okay, so we have this math problem: 5+3*2.

First, let's start with the addition part, which is 5+3. That's easy, it's 8!

Now, we have the multiplication part, which is 8*2. That's also easy, it's 16!

So, if we add 8 and 16 together, we get 24!

The answer is 24."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this problem...

Okay, I know that when you have a bunch of numbers and signs in a problem, you have to follow some rules to do them in the right order. I don't know what those rules are called, but I've heard my teacher talk about something called ""PEMDAS""...

So, let me try to do this problem step by step...

First, I see a 5. That's easy, I know that's just 5!

Next, I see a 2. That's easy too, 2 is just 2!

Then, I see a multiplication sign, and I know that means I have to do the multiplication before I do anything else. So I multiply 2 and 4, and that gives me...8!

Now, I have 5 and 8. I know I have to add them together, so...

The answer is 13!

(I hope that's right...I'm not sure if I did it right, but that's my best guess!)"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm just a elementary school student, and I'm not sure what this ""order of operations"" thing is all about. But I'll do my best to solve this problem.

First, I'll multiply 7 and 2, that's easy! 7*2 = 14.

Next, I'll multiply 8 and 5, that's also easy! 8*5 = 40.

Now, I'm not sure what to do next. I know I have to add something, but I'm not sure what. Oh wait, I remember my teacher saying something about adding numbers together! So, I'll add 14 and 40 together.

14 + 40 = 54.

The answer is 54!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Okay, I'm trying to solve this problem!

First, let's do the multiplication: 4 * 3 = 12

Next, let's add 2: 12 + 2 = 14

So, the answer is 14!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what the order of operations is. Can you please tell me what the order of operations is?

Oh, you want me to try my best without knowing the order of operations? Okay, let me see...

4*2+5=8+5=13
13+12=25
25-2*3=25-6=19

The answer is 19."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Okay, so we have a big number 5 and then a little number 3 and it's doing some kind of special thing to another little number 2. I'm not sure what that special thing is, but it looks like it's making the 3 bigger.

So, I think we should start by adding 5 and 3 together, because that's what we do when we don't know what else to do. That's like, the rule of math, right? So, 5 + 3 is 8.

Now, we have 8 and 2, and we need to do that special thing to 2. I think it's called ""multiplying"" or something like that. So, 8 times 2 is... ummm... 16!

The answer is 16."
