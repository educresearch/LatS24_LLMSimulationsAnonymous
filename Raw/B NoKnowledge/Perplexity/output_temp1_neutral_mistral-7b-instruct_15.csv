I see numbers and symbols, but I don't know the special rules for this yet. I think I'll do this step by step, the way I learned to add and multiply in kindergarten.

First, let's do the multiplication: 4 * 3 = 12 (because I counted 12 bubble groups when I arranged the circles and putting 4 circles in each group)

Next, let's do the addition: 12 + 2 = 14 (because I counted 14 pictures when I put 12 pictures together and added 2 more)

So, the answer is 14.

The answer is 14."

First, let's do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7
Next, I'll use the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28
Then, I'll do the remaining subtraction: 28 + 12 = 40
Lastly, I'll subtract 2 * 3: 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34."

Should I add 5 and 3 first, then multiply the result by 2? Or should I multiply 3 and 2 first, then add the result to 5? Let's try both ways and see which one gets us the correct answer.

First option: Add 5 and 3 first, then multiply the result by 2.
5 + 3 = 8
Then 8 * 2 = 16

Second option: Multiply 3 and 2 first, then add the result to 5.
3 * 2 = 6
Then 5 + 6 = 11

Both methods do not result in the same answer. Since I'm unsure which one to believe, let me ask for help from my teacher or a more knowledgeable person. They might know how to properly prioritize the mathematical operations to determine the correct answer.

The answer is ___(tosetbeaddedlater)_."
