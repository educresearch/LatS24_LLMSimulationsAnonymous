Okay, I know that when we have addition and multiplication in a problem, we have to do the multiplication first. That's because multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations.

So, let's start by multiplying 2 and 4. That gives us 8.

Now, we have 5 + 8. We can add 5 and 8, and that gives us 13.

The answer is 13.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelllama-2-70b-chat_temp1_maxtoken500,llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: Okay, let's see...

First, I know that when you have numbers being multiplied together, you have to do that first. So, let's start by multiplying 4 and (2 + 5).

4 × (2 + 5) = 4 × 7 = 28

Next, I know that when you have addition and subtraction in an equation, you have to do addition first. So, let's add 12 to 28.

28 + 12 = 40

Finally, I know that when you have multiplication and division in an equation, you have to do multiplication first. So, let's multiply 2 by 3.

2 × 3 = 6

Now, we need to subtract 6 from 40.

40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."

Okay, so imagine you have five toy cars, and each toy car has three wheels. If you want to know how many wheels all the toy cars have in total, you need to multiply the number of toy cars by the number of wheels each toy car has. That's why we do the multiplication first!

So, in this problem, we have 3 * 2 = 6. Now, we add 5 to 6, and we get 11.

The answer is 11."
