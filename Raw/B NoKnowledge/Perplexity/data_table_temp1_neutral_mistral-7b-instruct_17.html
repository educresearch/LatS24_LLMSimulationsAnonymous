      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I don't know about order of operations yet. I will do the calculation by following the simple rule: parents (multiplication and division) first, then addition and subtraction.<br><br>First, I'll do the multiplication inside the parentheses: 4 * (2 + 5)<br>4 * (2 + 5) = 4 * 7 = 28<br><br>Now, I'll do the addition inside the first parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7<br><br>So, the calculation becomes: 28 + 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Lastly, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right:<br>28 + 7 = 35<br>35 + 12 = 47<br>47 - 2 * 3 = 47 - 6<br><br>The answer is 41.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I am not yet familiar with the order of operations rule (PEMDAS). However, I can still try to solve the problem by doing the calculations in what seems to be a logical order. Here's what I would do:<br><br>1. First, I will add 2 and 5 together: 2 + 5 = 7<br>2. Next, I will multiply the result (7) by 4: 4 * 7 = 28<br>3. Then, I will do the second multiplication: 2 * 3 = 6<br>4. After that, I'll subtract 2 from the result of the previous step: 28 - 2 = 26<br>5. Lastly, I will add 12 to the result: 26 + 12 = 38<br><br>So, The answer is 38.<br><br>Note that this method may not always lead to the correct answer, since differently ordered operations could result in different outcomes. It is important to learn and follow the PEMDAS rule for accurate results in mathematics.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I need to do the calculation inside the parentheses, so 2 + 5 equals 7. Then, I need to do the multiplication before the addition and subtraction, so 4 times 7 equals 28. Finally, I need to do the addition and subtraction from left to right, so 28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 2 times 3 equals 38. The answer is 38.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about order of operations, I would do the calculation starting with the easiest symbols, which are the numbers and the multiplication, and then move on to the addition.

      <td>GPT Response: As a 6th grade student, I've learned to add and multiply, but I don't know the specific rules for which operations to do first. Let's see this problem step by step:<br><br>First, I see that there's an addition and a multiplication, but I don't know which one to do first. I'll try to do the multiplication first, because I remember that when I buy something at a store, I multiply the price by the quantity. So, I'll do 2*4:<br><br>2 * 4 = 8<br><br>Now, I have 5 and 8.

      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I have not learned about the order of operations yet. So, I would do the addition first and then the multiplication.<br><br>Here's my thought process:<br><br>1. First, I do the addition: 5 + 2<br>2. Then, I do the multiplication: 1 (result of addition) x 4<br><br>The answer is 5 + 2 x 4 = 11. (But this may actually be incorrect as per the PEMDAS rules).</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure which way to do this question because I don't know the rules for order of operations in math yet. But I think maybe we should do the multiplication first, then the addition. So we have 2 multiplied by 4 which makes 8, and then we add 5 to get the final answer.<br><br>The answer is 13. (This is incorrect as per the standard order of operations, but this is the best answer I can give given my limited understanding.)<br><br>Note: The correct answer should be 13, but this is obtained by following the wrong sequence of operations. The standard order of operations is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and last addition and subtraction (from left to right). Thus, the correct sequence of operations for 5 + 2 * 4 is 1) 2 * 4 = 8, and then 2) 5 + 8 = 13.</td>
