      <td>GPT Response: I would start by remembering that in this kind of problem, we have to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This helps to make sure that we solve the problem correctly.<br><br>First, I would solve the operation inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5. The result is 7.<br><br>Next, I would do multiplication, so I would multiply 4 by 7, which gives me 28.<br><br>Then, I would do the next multiplication, which is 2 times 3, giving me 6.<br><br>After that, I would do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So I would subtract 6 from 28 + 12, which gives me 40 + 12.<br><br>Finally, I would do the addition, which results in 52.<br><br>The answer is 52.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: I don't know about any order of operations rule, but I can still try to solve this problem. I would start by doing the operations that are inside the parentheses. That's what I would do even if I didn't know about PEMDAS.<br><br>First, I would add 2 + 5 to get 7.<br>Then, I would multiply 4 by 7 to get 28.<br>Next, I would multiply 2 by 3 to get 6.<br>After that, I would subtract 6 from 28 to get 22.<br>Lastly, I would add 12 to 22 to get 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this, I would first do the operations in the parentheses. That's the numbers inside the (). So, I would add 2 and 5 to get 7. <br><br>Then, I would multiply 4 by 7 because it's next in the order of operations (outside parentheses, we do multiplication and division first, before addition and subtraction). So, I would get 28.<br><br>Next, I would subtract 2 (from the original expression) because now I need to do addition and subtraction. But wait! I also have another multiplication: 2 times 3, which is 6. So, I subtract 6 from 28 instead of 2. That gives me 22.<br><br>Finally, I would add 12 to 22, which gives me 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
