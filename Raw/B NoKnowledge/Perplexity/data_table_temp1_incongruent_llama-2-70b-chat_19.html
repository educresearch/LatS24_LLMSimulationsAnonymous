      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm just a grade 6 student, and I'm not really sure about this order of operations thingy. But, I'll give it a shot.<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is the multiplication symbol, which means I have to do that first. So, I'll multiply 4 and 2+5, which gives me 4*7 = 28.<br><br>Next, I see the addition symbol, so I'll add 12 to 28, which gives me 40.<br><br>Lastly, I see the subtraction symbol, so I'll subtract 2 times 3 from 40, which gives me 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>So, the answer is 34.<br><br>I hope that's right!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm trying to solve this math problem, and I'm not sure where to start. I see all these numbers and symbols, but I don't know what to do with them. I've heard of something called PEMDAS, but I don't really understand what it means. Can you help me out?<br><br>Okay, so I think I'll start by multiplying 4 and 2+5. That gives me 4 * 7 = 28. Wait, what's next? Oh yeah, I need to add 12. So, 28 + 12 = 40. Hmm, what's next? Oh, I need to subtract 2 times 3. That's 2 * 3 = 6. So, 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.<br><br>I hope that's right! I'm really not sure if I did it correctly, but I tried my best. Can you please check it for me?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hi there! I'm not sure what PEMDAS means, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>First, I see a multiplication sign, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 2+5. That gives me 4 * 7 = 28.<br><br>Next, I see a plus sign, so I'll add 12 to 28. That gives me 40.<br><br>Finally, I see a minus sign, so I'll subtract 2 times 3 from 40. That gives me 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm just a beginner in math, but I'll do my best to solve this problem.<br><br>First, let's start by following the order of operations:<br><br>1. Parentheses: inside the parentheses we have 2+5 = 7<br>2. Exponents (none in this case)<br>3. Multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28<br>4. Addition: 28 + 12 = 40<br>5. Subtraction: 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34<br><br>The answer is 34!</td>

And then we have +2, that's 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.<br><br>I didn't use any fancy rule like PEMDAS, I just did what made sense to me. I multiplied 4 and 3 because that's what you do when you have two numbers and a multiplication symbol. Then I added 2 to 12 because that's what the plus sign means. And that gives us 14!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do something with these numbers, but I'm not sure what. I think I'm supposed to multiply 4 and 3, but then there's this plus sign and the number 2. I'm not sure what that means.<br><br>Oh wait, I think I remember something from class! The plus sign means we have to add something. So, if we multiply 4 and 3, that gives us 12, and then if we add 2, that makes 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what this "order of operations" thing is, but I can give it a try!<br><br>Okay, so I see a bunch of numbers and signs here. Let's start with the easiest thing: the addition. 5 + 2 is equal to 7.<br><br>Now, there's this weird symbol called "*" (I think it's called "multiplication" or something?). It looks like we're supposed to do that next.<br><br>So, 7 * 4... hmm, that's a bit tricky. My teacher said something about "multiplying the numbers together," so let's see... 7 times 4 is... 28!<br><br>Wait, what's that? There's another sign! It looks like a parentheses. I think we're supposed to do something with that too.<br><br>Oh, I remember! My teacher said we need to do whatever is inside the parentheses first. So, let's see... inside the parentheses, there's a 4.<br><br>Okay, so 4 * 4 is... 16!<br><br>Now, we can finally add 7 and 16 together. 7 + 16 is equal to... 23!<br><br>The answer is 23.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, but I don't know why. It just seems like the way it's done. So, I'll do the multiplication and then add the other number.<br><br>2 * 4 = 8<br><br>Now, I add the other number:<br><br>5 + 8 = 13<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
