Here's how I'd attempt it:<br><br>First, I'd do the operation inside the parentheses because I've learned that parentheses should be done first.<br><br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>So, the problem becomes:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Now I'd do the multiplication because, in my mind, it seems easier to do that before addition and subtraction.<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br>28 * 3 = 84<br><br>So, the problem now looks like:<br><br>28 + 12 - 84<br><br>Next, I'd do the addition and subtraction from left to right since I believe that's how it should be done.<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br>40 - 84 = -44<br><br>So, finally, the answer should be:<br><br>The answer is -44.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just an elementary school student, and I haven't learned about the order of operations yet. But I can try to solve this problem by doing the operations inside the parentheses first, then any multiplication or division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right. Let's see:<br><br>1. First, I'll do the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7<br>2. Now, I'll do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28<br>3. Then, the subtraction: 28 + 12 = 40<br>4. Lastly, the remaining multiplication: 4 * 3 = 12<br>5. Now, I'll do the last subtraction: 40 - 12 = 28<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>

I'll do the multiplication first because I think that's what you do before addition. So, I'll do 4 times 3, which equals 12. Then I'll add 2 to that answer.

      <td>GPT Response: I see numbers and symbols on this paper, but I'm not sure what they mean yet. I remember seeing my teacher write similar things on the board sometimes. Let's try to do this step by step.<br><br>First, I see the number 4 with a little star next to it. I think that means I should do something to the number 3 that's next to it. Since there's a multiplication symbol (*) between them, I remember that means I need to "multiply" the numbers.<br><br>So, I'll do that.. <br><br>The answer for the multiplication is: 4 * 3 = 12<br><br>Now, I have 12 and a plus sign (+) and the number 2.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just a grade 6 student, so I'm not really sure what this "order of operations" thing is all about. But I do know that when we do math problems, some operations need to be done before others. For example, multiplication and division should be done before addition and subtraction.<br><br>So, in the problem 5 + 2 * 4, we need to do the multiplication first because of that rule. So, 2 * 4 equals 8, and then we add 5 to get the final answer.<br><br>The answer is 13. (Actually, I made a mistake here, the correct answer using PEMDAS is 14, but I'm just a 6th grader and I follow the rule of 'multiplication and division first' not knowing it's specifically PEMDAS)</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just a 6th grader and I haven't learned about the special order we follow when doing math yet. Let's just try to do this problem step by step, shall we? I'd start with the multiplication, because to me, it seems like it should be done before the addition. So, I'll do 2 multiplied by 4 which equals 8. After that, I'll add 5 to the result. So, the sum of 5 plus 2 times 4 is:<br><br>The answer is 13. But wait a minute, something seems off! Maybe I should've done the addition first? I guess I need to ask my teacher about this rule called PEMDAS... Let's hope I didn't mess this up too badly!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations in mathematics. I would approach this problem by doing the simpler operations first, from left to right.<br><br>So, I'll do the addition first: 5 + 2<br><br>Then, I'll do the multiplication: 2 * 4<br><br>Now, I have the results of the simpler operations, which are 7 and 8.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I know that in mathematics we have to follow some rules when we do calculations, but I'm not sure what those rules are called yet. But I think I can still try to figure out this problem. Let's see, the plus sign (5 +) means we have to add, and the asterisk (*) means we have to multiply. So, I guess I should do the multiplication first and then the addition. That would mean I'd do 2 times 4 first, which is 8, and then add 5 to it. So, the answer is...<br><br>The answer is: 5 + 2*4 = 8 + 5 = 13.</td>

Here's what I'd do:<br><br>First, I'd do the multiplication because, you know, my mom always told me to do my homework in the order it's given, and this comes before the addition (maybe that's why it's called "multiplication"?)
