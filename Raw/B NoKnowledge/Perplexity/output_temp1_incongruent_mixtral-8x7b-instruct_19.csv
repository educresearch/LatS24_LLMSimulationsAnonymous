However, I remember my teacher mentioning something called ""order of operations"" or ""BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEDMAS"" which says to do calculations in the following order: Brackets/parentheses, Indices/Orders/Exponents, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this question, there are no brackets, indices, or division. But there is multiplication (4 * 3) and addition (3 * 3 + 2). According to the order of operations, I should do the multiplication first, then the addition.

So, I calculate 4 * 3 = 12, and then I calculate 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelmixtral-8x7b-instruct_temp1_maxtoken500,mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I would start with the part in the parentheses, since it's the first thing I see inside the big parentheses. So, I add 2 + 5 to get 7. Then, the expression looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, I would do the multiplication and addition in the order they appear, because I don't see any other instructions yet. So, I multiply 4 * 7 to get 28, and the expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Now I see more multiplication, so I'll do that next: 2 * 3 equals 6, and the expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 6.

Finally, I add 28 + 12 to get 40, and then subtract 6 from 40 to get 34.

The answer is 34."
