But I can still try to solve this problem! Let's see, I guess I should do the multiplication first, since I've learned that, and then add the results together. So, I'll do 7 times 2, which makes 14, and then 8 times 5, which makes 40. Then, I add those two numbers together. The answer is ... 14 + 40 = 54.
