I'm just a elementary school student, and I'm not sure what this \"order of operations\" thing is all about. But I'll do my best to solve this math problem.\n\nFirst, I see some numbers that are multiplied together, so I'll start by doing those. 4 times 2 is 8, and 8 times 5 is 40.\n\nNext, I see a plus sign, so I'll add 12 to 40. That gives me 52.\n\nNow, I see a minus sign, so I'll subtract 2 times 3 from 52. That's 6.\n\nFinally, I have my answer! The answer is 46.\n\nI hope that's right!
