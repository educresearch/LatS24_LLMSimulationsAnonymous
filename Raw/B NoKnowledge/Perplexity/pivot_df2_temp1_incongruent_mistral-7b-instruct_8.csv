mistral-7b-instruct,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I've never heard of ""order of operations"" or ""PEMDAS"" before. I'll just follow the rules I usually use when doing arithmetic:

1. Do the operations inside parentheses first:
   _ = 2 + 5
   _ = 4 * _

2. Multiply and divide from left to right:
   _ = 4 * 7
   _ = _ + 12
   _ = 29

3. Add and subtract from left to right:
   _ = 29 - 2 * 3
   _ = 29 - 6

The answer is 23.","GPT Response: As a sixth-grade student, I've learned how to do addition and multiplication, but I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations (PEMDAS). So, let's just do the arithmetic from left to right, and I'll make sure to ask my teacher about PEMDAS soon.

First, I'll do the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7
So, 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3 becomes:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3
= 28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I'll do the multiplication:
2 * 3 = 6
So, 28 + 12 - 6 becomes:

28 + 12 - 6
= 28 + 12 - 6

Now, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right:
12 + 28 = 40
So, 40 - 6 becomes:

40 - 6
= 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I have not learned about the order of operations in mathematics yet. However, I can try to solve the problem by doing the operations inside the parentheses first, then the multiplication, and finally the addition and subtraction. Here's how I would attempt to solve the problem:

First, I would calculate the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7

Next, I would do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28

Then, I would do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40, and 40 - 2 * 3 = 38

So, the answer is 38. However, according to the order of operations rule, which I haven't learned yet, the correct answer is actually 41. But based on my elementary understanding of mathematics, I believe the answer is 38.","GPT Response: Well, I'm just a student in elementary school and I don't really know about this thing called order of operations yet. But I see some numbers and some symbols, so I'll try to do the calculation step by step.

First, let's do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7. Now we have: 4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, we do the multiplication: 4 * 7 equals 28 and 2 * 3 equals 6. Now the equation looks like: 28 + 12 - 6.

Then, I do the addition and subtraction from left to right. First, I add 12 and 28 which makes 40. Finally, I subtract 6 from 40 and get: 34.

The answer is 34."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm a grade 6 student and I've never heard of the order of operations rule before. But, I see there are multiplication and addition signs in this equation. I guess I should do the multiplication first and then the addition, that's what I think makes sense. So, I will do 4 times 3, which equals 12. And then I will add 2 to get the final answer.

The answer is 14. (But this is incorrect as per the order of operations rule, PEMDAS, multiplication should be done before addition)","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I have not learned about the order of operations yet, but let's try to solve the problem step by step.

First, we need to do the multiplication: 4 * 3 = 12.

Then, we do the addition: 12 + 2 = 14.

So, the answer is: The answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I haven't learned about the order of operations yet. So, I would do this problem by doing the multiplication first and then the addition. It seems logical to me to do the multiplication before addition.

Let's start with the multiplication: 4 * 3 = 12

Now, let's do the addition: 12 + 2 = 14

So, the answer is: The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Well, I see numbers and some symbols on the board, but I don't know what they mean in the order they should be done yet. Let me try to figure this out. Since I don't know about things like ""multiplication first"" or ""exponents before multiplication and division,"" I'll just do the operations from left to right as they appear. So, I'll start with the multiplication:

4 * 3 = 12

Now, I'll do the addition:

12 + 2 = 14

So, the answer is:

The answer is _.__14_.

(Assumption: If there weren't a space between '+' and '2', my solution would have been different. This shows how important understanding the order of operations is.)"
mistral-7b-instruct,1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure about this math question since I haven't learned about the order of operations yet. But I think we might need to follow some rules to make sure we get the correct answer. Let's see, multiplication comes before addition, right? So let's do that first:

2 * 4 = 8

Now we have 5 + 8. I think addition comes before anything else, so:

5 + 8 = 13

So, The answer is 13.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I've never learned about the order of operations yet. So, I'll try to do this problem by following the rules that seem logical to me. I'll do the multiplication first because I think you need to find the result of that before you can add.

So, let's do the multiplication: 2 * 4 equals 8.

Now, I'll do the addition: 5 + 8.

To find the sum of 5 and 8, I'll write the numbers in a column like this:

```
5
+8
---
13
```

The answer is 13. So, 5 + 2 * 4 equals 13.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't know about the order of operations in mathematics yet. I would follow the simple rule I've learned so far which is to do addition and subtraction before multiplication and division. 

So, in this problem, I would first do the addition part: 
5 + 2 = 7

Then, I would do the multiplication part: 
2 * 4 = 8

Finally, I would put the numbers I got from the addition and multiplication together: 
The answer is 7 + 8 = 15. 

But actually, the correct answer according to the order of operations (PEMDAS) rule should be:
The answer is 5 + (2 * 4) = 5 + 8 = 13.","GPT Response: I'm an elementary school student, so I don't know about the special rules called order of operations or BIDMAS/BODMAS yet. From what I see, there are numbers, addition, and multiplication. Usually, when we do math, we do multiplication before addition. That's just what I've observed. So, let's give it a try!

First, I'll do the multiplication: 2 * 4 = 8

Then, I'll add 5: 5 + 8 = 13

The answer is __.
Answer: 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not too sure about this, but I think we need to do the multiplication before the addition, right? So, we should first multiply 3 by 2, which gives us 6. Then, we add 5 to that result. So, the answer is...

The answer is: 5 + 3 * 2 = 5 + 6 = 11.","GPT Response: As a sixth grade student, I've learned to add and multiply, but I'm not familiar with the order of operations yet. Let's try to do this problem step by step:

First, I see a multiplication sign (*), so I assume I need to do that first. I'll do the multiplication of 3 and 2:

3 * 2 = 6

Now, I'm left with the addition sign (+), so I'll do that:

5 + 6

Adding 5 and 6:

11

So, based on my current understanding, I think the answer is:

The answer is 11.

However, I'd better double check this solution with my teacher or a more experienced student to make sure it's correct, as I've learned there's a specific order to follow when doing multiple operations in one expression, which I haven't learned yet.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I'm not familiar with the order of operations rule yet. however, I'd try to do the problem by following what seems logical to me: first, I'd do the multiplication because I think it's easier to do that before adding. So I'd have 3 multiplied by 2, which is 6. Then I'd add the 5 to the 6, giving me an answer of 11.
The answer is 11.","GPT Response: As a curious student, I'd like to try and figure out this math problem. But I'm confused because I don't know which operation to do first. Let's give it a try, shall we?

First, I'll do the addition: 5 + 3 = 8.

Next, I'll do the multiplication: 8 * 2 = 16.

So, the answer must be this number: The answer is 16."

These rules are called the order of operations. So, let's see what we have here:

We have two groups of numbers: 7 * 2 and 8 * 5
