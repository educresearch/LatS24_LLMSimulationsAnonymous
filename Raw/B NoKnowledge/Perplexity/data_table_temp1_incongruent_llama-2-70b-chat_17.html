But I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 multiplied by something. That something is 2+5, right? So, I need to add 2 and 5 first. That's 7.<br><br>Now, I multiply 4 by 7, and I get 28.<br><br>Next, I see a minus sign! Ohno! That means I have to subtract something. It's 2 times 3, so that's 6.

That's what the multiplication symbol means, right? So, 4 multiplied by 3 is... ( counts on fingers) 12!<br><br>But wait, there's more! We have this fancy symbol called a "plus sign" (+). It means we need to add something. In this case, we need to add 2 to 12. So, 12 + 2 is... (counts on fingers again) 14!<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>5+2 * 4</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...<br><br>Okay, I know that the plus sign means we have to add two numbers together. So, I'll start by adding 5 and 2. That gives me 7.<br><br>But wait, there's more! I see a multiplication symbol (it looks like a cross) and some numbers after it. That means I have to multiply 2 numbers together. I'll multiply 2 and 4, and that gives me 8.<br><br>Now, I have two numbers: 7 and 8. I'm not sure what to do with them. Do I add them? Do I multiply them? I'm so confused!<br><br>Oh, I know! I remember my teacher saying something about following a special order when we do math problems. She called it PEMDAS. Let me see if I can remember what that means...<br><br>PEMDAS stands for "Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction." That's a lot to remember, but I think I can do it!<br><br>So, let's see... there aren't any parentheses or exponents in this problem. That means I can skip to the multiplication and division part. I already multiplied 2 and 4, so that's done. And there's no division in this problem either.<br><br>That means I can move on to the addition and subtraction part. I have two numbers: 7 and 8. I can add them together!<br><br>7 + 8 = 15<br><br>The answer is 15.<br><br>Yay! I did it! I hope that's correct!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. I think it might be some kind of magic formula that makes numbers bigger or something. But I'm not sure.<br><br>I think I'll just try to do the problem one step at a time and hope for the best.<br><br>First, I'll add 5 and 2. That's easy! 5 + 2 = 7.<br><br>Now, I have to multiply 4 by something. I'm not sure what to multiply it by, so I'll just multiply it by 7. 4 &times; 7 = 28.<br><br>So, the answer is 28.<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...<br><br>Okay, I know I need to follow some rules to solve this problem. I remember my teacher saying something about "PEMDAS"...<br><br>So, first, I need to do the "P" part, which means I need to do the parentheses. There aren't any parentheses in this problem, so I can skip that step.<br><br>Next, I need to do the "E" part, which means I need to do the exponents. There aren't any exponents in this problem either, so I can skip that step too.<br><br>Then, I need to do the "M" part, which means I need to do the multiplication. I see that there is a multiplication symbol in the problem, so I need to do that next.<br><br>I multiply 2 by 4 and get 8.<br><br>After that, I need to do the "D" part, which means I need to do the division. There isn't any division in this problem, so I can skip that step.<br><br>Finally, I need to do the "A" part, which means I need to do the addition. I add 5 and 8 and get 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! So, I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, but I don't know why. Can you tell me why, please?<br><br>Oh, it's because multiplication is like repeated addition, and we need to do it in a specific order or it gets confusing! Got it!<br><br>So, let's do the multiplication part: 2 * 4 = 8<br><br>Now, we add 5 + 8 = 13<br><br>The answer is 13!</td>
