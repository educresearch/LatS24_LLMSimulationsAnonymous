mistral-7b-instruct,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations rules (PEMDAS). However, I can still try to do this math problem by following the way numbers are written in the expression from left to right and inside the parentheses first. It's called the ""usual order"" or ""parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right)"".

Let's work through it step by step:

1. Solve the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7
2. Multiply: 4 * 7
3. Add: 4 * 7 + 12
4. Multiply: 2 * 3
5. Subtract: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3
6. Perform the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28, 2 * 3 = 6
7. Perform the addition: 28 + 12 = 40, 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I've never heard of the order of operations rule (PEMDAS). I'll just solve this problem by doing the calculations in the order they appear from left to right.

First, I'll do the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.

So the problem becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Now, I'll do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28, 2 * 3 = 6

Next, I'll do addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: As a young student, I'm not familiar with the order of operations in mathematics yet. I would follow what seems most logical to me. In this problem, I see that there are parentheses first, so I would do what's inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7. Then I see that there are multiplication signs, so I would do those: 4 * 7 = 28. After that, I see an addition sign and a subtraction sign, so I would solve the addition first: 28 + 12 = 40. Lastly, I would do subtraction: 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: As a helpless elementary school student, I have no idea about the order of operations in mathematics. I would just add, subtract, and multiply the numbers as they appear from left to right:

First, let's do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7

Then, we multiply: 4 * 7 = 28

Now, I'll subtract: 28 - 2 * 3 = 28 - 6

So, the answer is:

The answer is 22."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure what the order of operations means, but I think I've seen something like this before. Let me try to do it step by step. First, I'll do the multiplication, which is 4 times 3, so that's 12. Then, I'll do the addition, which is 12 plus 2, so that's 14. The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure about this thing called order of operations, but my teacher told me that sometimes we need to follow certain rules when solving math problems. Let's see what we have here: 4 times 3, and then add 2. That's what it looks like to me. But maybe there's a reason why we should do it differently? I'll ask my teacher tomorrow if I'm not sure. For now, let's just do it the way it's written. So I'll start with the multiplication: 

4 * 3 = 12

Then I'll do the addition:

12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't know about order of operations yet. But I see there are numbers, multiplication, and addition signs in this equation. Let's try to solve it step by step in the order I encounter the signs.

First, I'll do the multiplication: 4*3 = 12

Now I have 12 and the addition sign. Let's add 2 to 12: 12+2 = 14

So, I haven't learned PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction), but I tried to solve the problem by doing multiplication first and then addition based on the signs I encountered.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't know about order of operations yet. I will do the Multiplication first, and then the Addition.
So, First, I will find 4*3 which is 12, and then add 2 to it.
The answer is __.
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: As a Grade 6 student, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations in mathematics. However, I've heard that we usually perform multiplication before addition. So, I'd do the multiplication first, then add the numbers.

Here's the calculation:
First, I'll do the multiplication: 2 * 4 = 8
Then, I'll add the numbers: 5 + 8

The answer is: 13.","GPT Response: (I'm a grade 6 student and I haven't learned about order of operations in Mathematics yet.)

(I see there's addition and multiplication in this equation. I think I should do the multiplication first and then the addition, but I'm not sure.)

(Let's try it out: First, I'll do the multiplication, which is 2*4 = 8. Then, I'll do the addition, which is 5 + 8 = 13.)

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I have not learned about the order of operations in mathematics yet. Therefore, I would approach this problem by doing the simpler operations first and then moving on to the more complex ones. To me, addition and multiplication seem different, so I will do the multiplication first and then the addition.

So, I would calculate 2*4 = 8 and then add 5 to get the final answer:

The answer is: 5 + 8 = 13.","GPT Response: Well, I see numbers and some symbols on the board. I'm not sure what they mean, but let me try something. Maybe I should do the multiplication first because there are numbers and a multiplication sign there. So let's do 2 times 4, which is 8. Now I have 5 and 8. I think I should do the addition sign now, so I'll add those numbers together.

The answer is 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I've not learned the order of operations rule (PEMDAS) yet. However, I've heard some people suggest doing the multiplication before the addition to get a correct solution.

Here's what I'd do:

First, I'd do the multiplication: 3 * 2 = 6

Then, I'd do the addition: 5 + 6 = 11

So, The answer is 11.","GPT Response: As a 6th grade student, I have not learned about order of operations yet. But I can try to solve this problem by doing the multiplication first and then adding the results. So, let's do 3 multiplied by 2 which equals 6. Then add 5 to the result.

So, 3 multiplied by 2 equals 6, then add 5 to 6.

Therefore, The answer is __11__.

(Answer: 11)

(Note: This solution is not following the correct order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, and Addition and Subtraction from left to right. So it's essential to learn and apply the order of operations correctly to ensure accurate results.)","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I'm not familiar with the order of operations (PEMDAS) yet. I would follow this:

First, I see that there is an addition sign (5 +) and a multiplication sign (3 *). In the absence of knowledge about which operation to do first, I might calculate the multiplication because it involves two numbers (3 and 2) and a single symbol. But it's incorrect. In reality, you should perform the multiplication before the addition. The correct order is PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). So, let's follow the correct order now.

The problem is 3 * 2 + 5

First, we perform the multiplication: 3 * 2 = 6

Then, we perform the addition: 6 + 5 = 11

So, The answer is __.
Answer: 11.","GPT Response: Well, I'm an elementary school student and I don't know about the order of operations in math yet. So, let's just do this step by step. First, I'll do the multiplication because I see the asterisk (star) symbol. That makes it multiplication. So, 3 multiplied by 2 equals 6. Now I have 5 and 6. So, I'll do the addition. Five plus six equals eleven.

The answer is: 11."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Well, I'm just a grade 6 student and we haven't learned about the order of operations yet. But from what I remember, we do multiplication before addition. So, I'd first do the multiplication part.

7*2 = 14
8*5 = 40

Now, I have 14 and 40. Since addition comes before multiplication in the order of operations, I will do that next:

14 + 40 = 54

So, the answer is:

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm just starting to learn multiplication and addition, but I've heard that there's a rule called order of operations or PEMDAS that helps us do calculations the right way. From what I remember, we do multiplication before addition. So, let's apply that rule to the problem 7*2+8*5.

First, we'll do the multiplications:
7*2 = 14
8*5 = 40

Next, add the results from the multiplications:
14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: I'm not sure what the numbers mean when they're all put together like this with the * and + symbols. But I think I might have to remember something my teacher said about doing certain steps first. Let me try to remember... I think she said to do the ones with the multiplication symbol first. So I'll do 7 times 2 and 8 times 5 separately:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now I have two numbers, 14 and 40. I'm not sure what to do with them yet. But I remember my teacher also said to do the addition step last. So I'll add 14 and 40 together:

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: I'm just a little student and we haven't learned about which numbers to do first in math yet. So, let me try this by doing the multiplication first, then the addition:

2. Multiply 8 by 5: 40
3. Add the results of the multiplication: 14 + 40

The answer is: 54."
