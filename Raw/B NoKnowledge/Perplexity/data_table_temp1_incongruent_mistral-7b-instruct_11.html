      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure what this means by "order of operations," but I guess it has something to do with how you do the calculations in a math problem. I'll just try to do it step by step, either way.<br><br>First, I'll do the addition inside the parentheses, so 2 + 5 = 7.<br><br>Now, I have:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I'll do the multiplication. So, 4 * 7 = 28, and 2 * 3 = 6.<br><br>Now it looks like:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Next step, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So, 12 + 28 = 40, and 6 is less than zero, so I need to change the sign of the second multiplication: -6, so 40 + (-6).<br><br>When I add these numbers, the '-' sign changes, so the final answer is:<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a 6th grade student, I don't know about the order of operations called PEMDAS yet. But let me try to solve the problem step by step, based on what I think makes sense:<br><br>1. The parentheses (2+5) are the first operations I see, so I add 2 and 5, which gives 7.<br>2. Then I have 4 times 7, so I multiply 4 and 7, which equals 28.<br>3. After that, there's a plus sign (+) and 12, so I add 12 to the previous result, 28. That gives me 40.<br>4. Finally, there is a minus sign (-) and 2 times 3, so I subtract 2 times 3 from 40, which results in 38.<br><br>The answer is 38.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations in Mathematics. However, I can try to solve the problem by doing each operation as they appear from left to right, just like reading a book. Below is how I would approach the given problem:<br><br>First, I will do the operation inside the parentheses: <br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now, I will perform the multiplication operations from left to right:<br>4 * 7 = 28<br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>Next, I will do the addition and subtraction operations from left to right:<br>28 + 12 = 40<br>40 - 2 = 38<br><br>So, the answer is:<br><br>The answer is 38.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Alright, let's solve this math problem step by step just like we do in our brand new colorful math workbook at school!<br><br>First, let's do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.<br><br>Now we have 4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, we do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28.<br><br>So now it's 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Let's do the subtraction inside the parentheses: 2 - 3 = -1.<br><br>Now it's 28 + 12 + (-1).<br><br>Lastly, do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40, 40 + (-1) = 39.<br><br>The answer is 39.</td>

When I see this problem, 4 * 3 + 2, I'd follow what I've learned about multiplication and addition being the basic operations. I'd do the multiplication first – 4 times 3 equals 12.

      <td>GPT Response: Well,I am just a grade 6 student and I haven't learnt about the order of operations yet. But, I think we should do the multiplication before addition, because the symbol for multiplication (asterisk or cross) is usually closer to the numbers being multiplied than the plus sign. So, the calculation should be: 2 * 4 = 8, and then 5 + 8. So, the answer is: <br><br>The answer is __13__. (By mistake instead of 11, because I am a grade 6 student just learning this concept)</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I haven't learned about the order of operations yet. So, I'll do the math problem based on what looks simpler to me first.<br><br>I see the multiplication sign (*) between 2 and 4, so I'll do that one first because it looks easier than addition.<br><br>2 * 4 = 8<br><br>Now, I have 5 + 8 in front of me.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure what to do with this problem. But I think I should try to do the multiplication before the addition because there's a symbol (the asterisk) representing multiplication.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I see numbers and symbols, but I'm not sure what they mean yet. Let's try to figure it out together. First, I'll do the multiplication because I see a star (*), which I think means "multiplication" or "times." So, 2 times 4 equals 8. Now I only have the addition left: 5 plus 8. When I add 5 and 8, I get 13. So, the answer is...<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just a 6th grader and I don't really understand the order of operations in mathematics yet. But, I've heard that sometimes you need to do certain operations before others. Let's see what we have here:<br><br>We have addition (5 + 3) and multiplication (3 * 2) in one expression. I think we should do the multiplication first because the multiplication symbol is next to the numbers being multiplied, and we often do that before addition. That's what I've heard, anyway.<br><br>So, let's do 3 * 2 first and get 6.

      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I haven't learned about the order of operations yet. But I see there are addition and multiplication signs in it. I think I should try to do the multiplication first and then the addition, because the multiplication symbol seems to be in the middle, and I've heard that's how to read a mathematical expression from left to right. So, let me do the multiplication: 3 * 2 = 6. Now I have 5 + 6. I add these two numbers: 5 + 6 = 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I saw this funny looking symbol '\*' and I think it means to do something special with the numbers around it. But I'm not sure what, so let's try the addition first. That's 5 and 3, makes 8. Then the '*' symbol, hmmm, this might mean multiply. So that's 8 and 2, which makes 16. The answer is 16.<br><br>The answer is 16.</td>
