      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm not familiar with the order of operations rule in mathematics, which is often represented by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>To solve the problem 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3, I would approach it using the following steps based on what seems logical to me:<br><br>1. I see parentheses in the expression, so I'll start by doing what's inside: 2+5 = 7<br>2. Then, I see a multiplication sign (of the 4 and 7): So, I'll calculate that, which is 4 x 7 = 28<br>3. Next, there's a "+12": I'll add 12 to the result I got from the previous step: 28 + 12 = 40<br>4. Then, there's another multiplication: 3 * 2: I'll multiply that, which is 6.<br>5. Lastly, I see a subtraction sign "-2 * 3": I will subtract 2 times 3 from the result I got before that: 40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So, following my logic without being aware of the order of operations rule, I would answer:<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a sixth grade student, I've never heard of the order of operations rule called PEMDAS. But I've been told to perform calculations in a logical way. So let's do the addition and subtraction inside the parentheses first:<br><br>2 + 5 = 7, so the calculation becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Now I'll do the multiplication:<br><br>4 * 7 = 28, and 2 * 3 = 6, so the calculation becomes: 28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Finally, I'll do the addition and subtraction, starting from left to right:<br><br>28 + 12 = 40, and 40 - 6 = 34, so the answer is:<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: well, I don't know much about this "order of operations" thingy yet, but I see some numbers and signs in this equation. Let's do the calculation one step at a time, just like adding and subtracting numbers in kindergarten.<br><br>first, I see the parentheses (2 + 5), so I add those numbers: 2 + 5 = 7<br>then, I see the multiplication sign (4 * 7), so I multiply those numbers: 4 * 7 = 28<br>then, there's another multiplication sign (2 * 3), I'll do that next: 2 * 3 = 6<br>then I see addition (4 * 7 + 12) and subtraction (+12 - 2) signs. Let's do the addition first: 28 + 12 = 40<br>Lastly, do the subtraction: 40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So, The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I know numbers and how to do simple addition, subtraction, multiplication, and even some parentheses, but I have never heard about this thing called "order of operations" or "PEMDAS" rule. Let's try and figure this out without those rules.<br><br>First, I see there are parentheses, so let's do what we know:<br><br>1. The numbers inside the parentheses, 2 and 5, are added: 2 + 5 = 7.<br>2. Now, I have 4 multiplied by 7: 4 * 7 = 28.<br>3. Next is the addition: 28 + 12 = 40.<br>4. Subtraction is next, but it involves a negative number, so we'll find the absolute values of the numbers involved in the subtraction (2 and 3) and do the addition instead: 40 + 2 = 42 and 42 + 3 = 45.<br><br>The answer is 45.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I know that in mathematics, sometimes we need to follow certain rules to solve an expression correctly. But I'm not quite sure what those rules are yet.

      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I haven't learned about the order of operations in math yet.

I know that addition comes before subtraction in math, but I'm not sure if the same rule applies to multiplication and addition. Let me ask my teacher for clarification next time in class.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm only in grade 6 and haven't learned the order of operations yet, but I do know that we normally read and do math from left to right. So, I'd first do the addition: 5 + 2. That gives me 7. Then, I'd do the multiplication: 2 * 4. Multiplying 2 and 4 gives me 8. Now, I'd substitute 7 from the addition step into the expression and do the multiplication: 7 * 8. Multiplying 7 and 8 gives me 56.So, the answer is...<br><br>The answer is 56.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations rules (PEMDAS) in mathematics.

      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I've learned how to do addition and multiplication separately. So, let's do multiplication first: 2 * 4 = 8. Then, we add the results of addition and multiplication: 5 + 8. That gives us the final answer: The answer is 13.</td>

They call it the Order of Operations, but I don't get it yet.<br><br>But, I do remember that sometimes I need to do multiplication before addition or subtraction, depending on the symbols inside the parentheses. And I know that Sherlock Bones the mathematic dinosaur recommends using PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction.<br><br>So, let's see what we have here. There are no parentheses or exponents, so let's try with the first rule, which is multiplication.<br><br>7 * 2 = 14<br>8 * 5 = 40<br><br>Now we have two numbers, 14 and 40.
