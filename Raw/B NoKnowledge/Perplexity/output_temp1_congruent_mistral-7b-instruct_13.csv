But I can still try to do this problem by doing the multiplication first, then the addition.

First, I'll do the multiplication: 4 times 3 equals 12.

Next, I'll do the addition: 12 plus 2 equals 14.

So, the answer is 14.

The answer is 14."

I would solve this problem by doing the addition and subtraction inside the parentheses first, then the multiplication, and lastly, the addition.

First, I'll do the addition inside the parentheses (2 + 5 = 7), then I'll do the other multiplication (2 * 3 = 6), and finally, I'll add and subtract the other numbers (4 * 7 = 28, 28 + 12 = 40, 40 - 2 = 38)
