      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?<br><br>Okay, so I know that 2 + 5 = 7, and 7 * 4 = 28.<br><br>Then, 12 - 2 * 3 = 12 - 6 = 6.<br><br>So, the answer is 28 + 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not really sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is 4*2, which is 8. Then there's a plus sign and a 5, so that's 8 + 5, which is 13.<br><br>Next, I see a plus sign and a 12. That's easy, 13 + 12 is 25.<br><br>Now, there's a minus sign and a 2*3. I'm not sure what to do here. I think I'm supposed to multiply 2 and 3 first, so that's 6. Then I subtract 6 from 25, and that gives me 19.<br><br>The answer is 19.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...<br><br>So, we have 4 groups of something, and each group has 2 + 5 things in it. That means we have 4 groups of 7 things altogether.<br><br>Then, we have 12 more things that we need to add to that total.<br><br>But wait, there's a minus sign! That means we need to take away something. We need to take away 2 groups of 3 things from the total.<br><br>Okay, so let's see... 4 groups of 7 things is 28 things. Then we add 12 more things, that's 40 things. Oops, wait, we need to take away 2 groups of 3 things, that's 6 things.<br><br>So, the final answer is 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, let's see...<br><br>First, we need to do the addition inside the parentheses. That's 2 + 5, which equals 7.<br><br>Next, we multiply 4 by 7, and that gives us 28.<br><br>After that, we add 12 to 28, and that gets us 40.<br><br>Finally, we subtract 2 times 3, which is 6.<br><br>So, the final answer is... 40 - 6 = 34!<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

So, we have 5 plus 2 times 4, right?<br><br>First, I think we should do the multiplication because it's inside the parentheses, like my teacher says. So, 2 times 4 is 8.<br><br>Next, we add 5 and 8, and that gives us 13.<br><br>So, the answer is 13!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll give it my best shot!<br><br>So, 5 + 2*4... hmmm... I think I should start by multiplying 2 and 4 because that's what the multiplication symbol () means, right? So that's 8.<br><br>Now, I have 5 + 8... oh wait, I think I need to add 5 and 8! So, 5 + 8 = 13.<br><br>The answer is 13!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this problem...<br><br>Okay, I know I have to follow some steps to solve it. I remember my teacher saying something about PEMDAS. I think it means we have to do things in a special order.<br><br>First, I see a 5. That's easy, I know what to do with a 5! I'll write it down.<br><br>Next, I see a 2. Hmm, what do I do with a 2? Oh yeah, I have to multiply it by something. I see a 4 right after it, so I'll multiply 2 and 4 together. That's 8!<br><br>Now, I have 5 and 8. I have to add them together. 5 + 8 is 13!<br><br>The answer is 13.<br><br>(And that's how I, as an elementary school student who knows nothing about order of operations, would solve the problem 5 + 2*4 using PEMDAS!)</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what the * means. Can you help me?<br><br>Oh, you're saying that * means multiplication? Okay, so 2*4 means 2 times 4, which is 8.<br><br>So, 5 + 8 is 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

But I think we're supposed to follow some rules to make sure we get the right answer. So, let's see...<br><br>First, I think we should do the multiplication because it says "3*2" before the addition symbol. That means we need to multiply 3 and 2, which gives us 6.<br><br>Next, we have the addition symbol, so we add 5 and 6. That gives us 11.<br><br>So, the answer is 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I think I can help you with that math problem!<br><br>So, 5 + 3*2... hmmm... first, let's do the multiplication. 3 times 2 is 6, right?<br><br>So, now we have 5 + 6... oh, I know! We have to add 5 and 6! That's 11!<br><br>The answer is 11! ðŸ˜Š</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, but I don't know why. I just know that's the rule. So, I'll do the multiplication first. 3*2 = 6. Now, I add 5 to 6 and get 11. The answer is 11.</td>

I think I'll just do the multiplication in my head and see what happens.<br><br>7*2 is 14.<br>8*5 is 40.<br><br>Okay, so now I have 14 and 40. I'm not sure what to do next.
