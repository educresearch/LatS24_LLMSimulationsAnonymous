      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it my best shot.<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 multiplied by something. That something is 2+5, right? So, I add 2 and 5 and get 7. Cool! So, now it's 4 times 7, which is... um... 28!<br><br>But wait, there's more! There's this 12 thingy that needs to be subtracted. Okay, 28 minus 12 is... hmm... 16!<br><br>Oh, and there's that 2 times 3 thingy too. That's easy, 2 times 3 is 6.<br><br>So, let me see... 16 minus 6 is... 10!<br><br>The answer is 10!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?<br><br>Wait, I know! Let me try to do it step by step. So, first, we have 4 times 2 which is 8. Then, we add 5 to that which is 13. After that, we add 12 to 13 which is 25. Finally, we subtract 2 times 3 which is 6 from 25, and that gives us... 19!<br><br>The answer is 19!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so we have this big equation: 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3.<br><br>First, let's start by doing the stuff inside the parentheses. We have 2+5, which is equal to 7.<br><br>So, now we have 4 * 7, which is equal to 28.<br><br>Next, we have 12. We just add 12 to 28, which gives us 40.<br><br>Finally, we have -2 * 3, which is equal to -6.<br><br>We add -6 to 40, and we get 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm just a elementary school student, and I'm not sure what this "order of operations" thing is all about. But I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>First, I see a bunch of numbers and signs, so I'll just follow the rules I've learned in class.<br><br>I'll start by multiplying 4 and 2+5, which gives me 4 * 7 = 28.<br><br>Next, I see a minus sign, so I'll subtract 2 * 3 from 28, which gives me 28 - 6 = 22.<br><br>Finally, I see a plus sign and a number, so I'll add 12 to 22, which gives me 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

That's a pretty easy number, so I'll start with that. The answer is 5.<br><br>Next, I see a 3. That's also a pretty easy number, so I'll add it to the 5. The answer is now 8.<br><br>But wait, there's more! I see a 2 next to a multiplication sign. I'm not really sure what that means, but I think it means I have to multiply the 8 by 2.

      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! So, I've got this math problem and I'm supposed to find the answer. Okay, so I see a 5 and a 3, and then there's this weird symbol that looks like a cross between a multiplication sign and a plus sign. I think it means I have to multiply 3 and 2 together, so that's what I'll do. So, 3 times 2 is 6. But wait, there's more! There's still that 5 sitting there all by itself. I think I have to add it to the 6, so that's what I'll do. So, 6 plus 5 is... (drumroll please)... 11! The answer is 11! Woohoo, I did it! üòÑ</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Okay! So, I know that when we do math, we have to follow some rules. One of those rules is called the "order of operations." It helps us figure out which operations to do first.<br><br>The order of operations is like a recipe. We have to follow the steps in the recipe to make sure our math is correct. The steps are:<br><br>1. Parentheses<br>2. Exponents (like squaring or cubing)<br>3. Multiplication and Division (we do these in the order they appear from left to right)<br>4. Addition and Subtraction (we do these in the order they appear from left to right)<br><br>Now, let's look at the problem: 7 * 2 + 8 * 5.<br><br>First, we need to do the multiplication. We have two multiplication problems: 7 * 2 and 8 * 5. We do these in the order they appear from left to right.<br><br>7 * 2 = 14<br>8 * 5 = 40<br><br>Next, we need to add 14 and 40. We add 14 + 40 = 54.<br><br>So, the final answer is 54.<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
