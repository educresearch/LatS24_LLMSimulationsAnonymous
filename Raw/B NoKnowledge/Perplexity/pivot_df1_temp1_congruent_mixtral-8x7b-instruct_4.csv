mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Okay, so if I were a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would just solve this problem from left to right. That's because I haven't learned yet that I should do operations in a particular order.

So, here's what I would do:

First, I would multiply 7 by 2, which equals 14.
Next, I would multiply 8 by 5, which equals 40.
Lastly, I would add those two results together: 14 + 40.

And the answer is 54.

The answer is 54."

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first follow the arithmetic skills I have learned so far. I would start by doing the addition and subtraction inside the parentheses:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I would do the multiplication:

28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, I would do the addition:

40 - 6

The answer is 34.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: As a 6th grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think about doing the addition and multiplication at the same time because the question doesn't tell me what to do first.

However, if I had to guess, I would do the multiplication first because it seems like I should do that operation before the addition. So, I would calculate 3*2 to get 6.

Then, I would add the 5 to the 6 to get 11.

Therefore, the answer is 11."

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Hi, I'm a 6th grade student who doesn't know about order of operations yet. To solve this problem, I will do the operations in the order they are given, from left to right.

First, I will do the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.

Now my equation looks like this: 4 \* 7 + 12 - 2 \* 3

Next, I will do the multiplication: 4 \* 7 equals 28, and 2 \* 3 equals 6.

Now my equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, I will do the addition: 28 + 12 equals 40, and then I will subtract 6 from 40.

So, when you do all the operations from left to right, you get:

The answer is 34."

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: If I were given the math problem ""4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3"" and I didn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would still solve it step by step. But I might not get the correct answer because I'm not considering the operations' priority. Here's how I would solve it:

1. Add 2 + 5 to get 7.
2. Multiply 4 by 7 to get 28.
3. Add 12 to get 40.
4. Multiply 2 by 3 to get 6.
5. Subtract 6 from 40 to get 34.

However, since I don't know the order of operations, my answer is probably not correct. The actual answer should be determined using PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). With the correct order of operations, the problem should be solved as follows:

1. Add 2 + 5 to get 7.
2. Do the first multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28.
3. Then do the second multiplication: 2 * 3 = 6.
4. Do the subtraction: 28 - 6 = 22.
5. Finally, do the addition: 22 + 12 = 34.

So, the answer is actually 34."

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Well, as a student in elementary school, I would first solve the multiplication problems separately, since that's what we've learned so far. So:

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I would first guess that you would do the multiplication and addition from left to right. So I would do 4 times 3 first and get 12, and then add 2 to get 14. But I've heard that there is a special rule called the order of operations that tells you to do the multiplication and division before the addition and subtraction, even if they come first. So I should follow that rule. Doing the multiplication first gives me 12, and then adding 2 gives me 14. The answer is 14."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: I don't know about order of operations, but I remember my teacher saying something about doing calculations in parentheses first. So, I'll follow those grouping symbols.

First, I'll do the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.

Now it looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, I'll do the multiplication and division from left to right: 4 times 7 equals 28, and 2 times 3 equals 6.

So now it looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.

Lastly, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 plus 12 equals 40, and 40 minus 6 equals 34.

The answer is 34."
