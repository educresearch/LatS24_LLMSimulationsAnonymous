mistral-7b-instruct,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I don't know about order of operations yet. But I can try to solve this math problem step by step. Here's what I would do:

First, I would add 2 and 5 together: 2 + 5 = 7
Then, I would multiply 4 by 7: 4 x 7 = 28
Next, I would multiply 2 and 3: 2 x 3 = 6
Then, I would subtract 6 from 12: 12 - 6 = 6
Finally, I would add 28 and 6: 28 + 6 = 34

So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I don't know about any special rules for solving mathematical expressions yet. So I will just follow the simple rule of doing the operations inside the parentheses first, then any multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right.

Let's follow the steps:

1. Solve the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7
2. Multiply 4 by 7: 4 x 7 = 28
3. Now, do the other multiplication: 2 x 3 = 6
4. Subtract 6 from the earlier result (28 - 6): 22
5. Lastly, add 12: 22 + 12 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I wouldn't be familiar with the order of operations (PEMDAS) yet. However, I can still try to solve the problem by doing the operations inside the parentheses first, then the multiplication and division, followed by addition and subtraction.

Let's see how that looks:

Given expression: 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3

First, do the operations inside the parentheses:

4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3
4* (7) + 12 - 2*3

Now, do the multiplication:

4*7 + 12 - 2*3
28 + 12 - 2*3

Next, do the subtraction:

28 + 12 - 5
39 - 5

Lastly, do the addition:

34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: As a first-grader, I like to follow the order I learn the mathematical operations. So, I'll do addition and subtraction first, then multiplication.

First, let's do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.

Now, we have 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

 next is multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28; 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, we have 28 + 12 - 6.

Lastly, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 38; 38 - 6 = 32.

The answer is 32."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not quite sure about this ""order of operations"" thing you mentioned. But I can try to solve the problem step by step. Let's do the multiplication first, because I think that comes before addition, right? So, 4 times 3 equals 12. Now, let's do the addition. So, 12 plus 2 equals 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a 6th grade student, I've learned to add and multiply, but I haven't learned the order of operations yet, so I'll do it the way it looks on the page. Let's see what that means for this problem.

First, I'll do the multiplication:
4 * 3 = 12

Next, I'll do the addition:
12 + 2 = 14

So, the final answer is:

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Well, I'm an elementary school student, so we haven't learned about the order of operations yet. But I can still try to solve this problem by doing the simple arithmetic from left to right as much as I can, and then doing any multiplication we encounter. So let's start with the multiplication: 4 * 3 equals 12. Then we have the addition: 12 + 2 equals 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: I see numbers and some signs here, but I don't know in what order I should do them yet. Let's try it out this way: so first, I will do the multiplication because I think that's what we do first, right? That makes it 12. Then I'll add the number 2. So, 12 + 2 equals 14.

The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I have not learned about order of operations yet. But I can try to solve this problem based on what I know about simple addition and multiplication.

First, I see that there is multiplication involved (2*4). I remember that multiplication comes before addition in a simple subtraction, addition, multiplication, division, or Parentheses (SAMD or PEMDAS) sequence. However, since I don't know this rule formally, I intuitively understand that multiplication should be done first.

So, I will do the multiplication step: 2*4 = 8

Then, I will do the addition: 5 + 8

The answer is __:

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: I'm a grade 6 student, and I've never heard of the order of operations in mathematics before. Today, I encountered this problem: 5 + 2*4. I think I should do the multiplication first because 2 is being used with 4. I'll perform the multiplication and get 8, then add 5 to the result. So, the solution looks like this:

The answer is: 5 + 2*4 = 5 + 8 = 13.","GPT Response: Well, I don't really know about this ""order of operations"" thing, but the teacher told us to do multiplication before addition, so I think we should do that here. So, I'll do the multiplication first: 2*4 equals 8. Then I add the numbers: 5 + 8. That gives me 13. The answer is 13.","GPT Response: Well, I'm just a little kid and we haven't learned about order of operations yet. But I know that when we do addition and multiplication in the same sentence, some people say we should do the multiplication before the addition. So, I'll try that and see what happens!

First, let's do the multiplication: 2 * 4 = 8.

Now, let's do the addition with the result we got: 5 + 8.

Hmm, this is getting a bit big. Let me double-check: 5 + 8 = 13.

So, the answer to the problem 5 + 2*4 is...

The answer is: 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: I'm a grade 6 student and I've never heard about the order of operations in mathematics before. Let's try to solve this problem step by step. Since I see an addition sign (+) and a multiplication sign (*) in one expression, I think I should do the multiplication first and then the addition. So, I'll do 3 multiplied by 2 which equals 6. Now, I'll add 5 to the result.

The answer is: 5 + 3*2 = 5 + 6 = 11.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I have not learned about the order of operations in mathematics yet. So, I will solve the problem by doing the multiplication first and then the addition. It might not be the correct way, but here is what I understand:

I see the multiplication sign (3*2), so I will do that first: 3 multiplied by 2 equals 6.

Then I see the addition sign (+) between 5 and 6. So, I will add them together: 5 + 6 equals 11.

Therefore, The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Well, I don't really know much about the rules for doing math in a certain order yet. But I heard my teacher mention something about parents, exponents, multiplication, and division, and addition last. So, maybe we should do the multiplication first and then the addition? Let's try that:

First, we have 3 multiplied by 2. That makes 6.

Then, we add 5.

So, the answer is __6 + 5__

But, maybe that's not right, since the teacher said to do addition last. I better double-check with her.

The answer is 11. (But I'm still not completely sure yet!)","GPT Response: I'm an elementary student and I don't know about order of operations yet. Let's just do the multiplication first and then add: 3 multiplied by 2 is 6, so the problem becomes 5 + 6. I'll add these two numbers together: 5 + 6 equals 11.

The answer is 11."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: I'm not sure about the rules for solving math problems with different operations at the same time. Let me try to do this step by step.

First, I'll calculate the multiplication problems:

1. 7 * 2 = 14
2. 8 * 5 = 40

Now, I'll add the results of those multiplication problems:

14 (from 7 * 2) + 40 (from 8 * 5) = 54

The answer is: 54.","GPT Response: As a 6th grade student, I have not learned about the order of operations in mathematics yet. So I will do the problem by just following the numbers from left to right, which is called the ""standard order"" but it's less efficient and can lead to errors for more complex problems. 

First, I do the multiplication: 7*2 = 14 and 8*5 = 40.

Then, I do the addition: 14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't know about the order of operations yet. So, I would just do the multiplication first, and then the addition. It means I would calculate 7*2 and 8*5 separately first, then add the results.

Here is the calculation:
1. 7*2 = 14
2. 8*5 = 40
3. The answer is 14 + 40 = 54.

The answer is __.
The answer is 54.","GPT Response: I'm not sure what to do first, but I think I should try to do the multiplication part before the addition. So, I'll do 7 times 2, which equals 14, and then do 8 times 5, which equals 40. Then, I'll add those two numbers together.

The answer is 54."
