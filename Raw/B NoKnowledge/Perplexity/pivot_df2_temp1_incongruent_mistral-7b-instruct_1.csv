mistral-7b-instruct,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I don't know about the order of operations yet. But I can try to solve this problem by doing the operations inside the parentheses first, then the multiplication, finally the addition and subtraction.

So, let's first do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.

Now we have: 4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3

Then we do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6.

Now we have: 28 + 12 - 6

Adding the numbers: 28 + 12 = 38. And then subtracting 6: 38 - 6 = 32.

The answer is: 32.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I don't know about the order of operations yet. I'll do the calculation step by step, but it might not be the correct way.

First, I'll do the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7, so 4 * (2 + 5) = 4 * 7.

Next, I'll do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28.

Then, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 30. But we also have to subtract 2 * 3: 30 - 2 * 3 = 30 - 6 = 24.

So, I'm not sure if my answer is correct or not. Let's check:

The answer is 24. (But check with someone who knows PEMDAS to make sure!)","GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS is or what the steps are in mathematics for solving problems with parentheses, exponents, multiplication, and addition or subtraction. But, I'll try to do it by processing the calculating symbols from left to right and performing the operations inside the parentheses first.

First, I see that there's an addition inside the parentheses (2 + 5), so I solve that first:

2 + 5 = 7

Now, I replace the addition with the number seven in the original problem:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

I notice there is still an addition and a subtraction. I'll approach the addition first, then maybe the subtraction.

4 * 7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40

Now, I have:

40 - 2 * 3

Next, I see multiplication (2 * 3). I'll solve that:

2 * 3 = 6

Finally, I have:

40 - 6

So, I just need to perform subtraction:

40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Well, I'm just a simple elementary school student, so I don't know much about the special rules for solving math problems. But I can try to follow the numbers as they're given to me.

First, let's do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7. So the problem becomes 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, I'll do the multiplication: 4 * 7 equals 28, and 2 * 3 equals 6.

Now, it looks like there's addition and subtraction left, so I'll try to do those next, starting with the addition: 28 + 12 equals 40.

Then, there's a subtraction: 40 - 6 equals 34.

So, the answer is 34."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what the correct way to solve this problem is, but I guess I should try to follow some rules. Let's see, there are some symbols here - multiplication and addition. I think I've heard something about an order in which to do these operations. It's called PEMDAS, right? But I'm not quite sure what each letter stands for. Maybe I should look it up... Anyway, I think the first step is to do the multiplication, so I'll do 4 times 3: that's 12. Now I've got 12 and 2 left to add. So the answer should be... 12 plus 2. The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Well, this problem has numbers and symbols, so I guess it's a math problem. But the teacher never told us about any special rules for solving math problems yet. Let's try to figure it out:

1. The first symbol we see is the multiplication sign (*), so we might want to do that first. But there's a plus sign (+) after it, so we can't just do that alone.
2. Maybe we should do the addition part first since it comes before the multiplication in the row of symbols? I don't know if that matters, though.
3. Let's give it a try and do the addition first: 3 * (4 + 2)
4. Now we need to do the addition part: 3 * (4 + 2) = 3 * (6)
5. Next, we have the multiplication: 3 * 6 = 18

The answer is 18.","GPT Response: As a beginner student in elementary school, I would approach this Mathematics problem by doing each operation one by one, starting from left to right. So, I would first do the multiplication:

4 * 3 = 12 {I memorized that 4 times 3 is 12.}

Now, I have 12 and the addition symbol (+). I would then do the addition:

12 + 2 = 14

So, using this approach, the final answer would be:

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: I don't know about order of operations yet, but I've heard that sometimes you need to do certain calculations before others. Let's try this: First, I'll do the multiplication because I think that's what you're supposed to do before addition. So, that's 4 times 3, which equals 12. Now, I'll do the addition: 12 plus 2. That makes 14. So, the answer is 14.

The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I have not learned about order of operations yet. But I can try to solve the problem by guessing which operation to do first. Based on what I see, I think I should do the multiplication first because it has two numbers next to each other. So, I'll do 2 * 4, which equals 8. Then, I'll add 5 to that result. So, the calculation would look like this:

5 + 2 * 4 = 5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I don't know about order of operations yet. But I see that there's an addition and multiplication sign in this equation. I think I should try to do the multiplication first, since the asterisk (*) looks like it represents multiplication. So, I'll do 2 * 4 = 8 first. Then I'll do the addition: 5 + 8. This gives me the final answer.

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: Well, I'mjusta elementary student and I don't really know about this thing called order of operations or PEMDAS. But from what I've observed, sometimes we have to do multiplication and division before addition and subtraction, but I'm not sure in what order exactly.  So, I'll try to do the multiplication first and then the addition:

First, I'll do 2 * 4 = 8.
Then I'll do 5 + 8.

The answer is __13__. (But remember, as a young student, I'm not really sure if this is the right way to do it, because my teacher has not explained order of operations to me yet.)","GPT Response: I'm not sure what to do first. This equation has both addition and multiplication. Let's try solving it step by step. I'll start with the multiplication because I see it before the addition sign.

First, I'll do the multiplication: 2 * 4 = 8

Now, I have this: 5 + 8

Now, let's do the addition: 5 + 8 = 13

mistral-7b-instruct,1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm just a grade 6 student and I'm not familiar with the order of operations in mathematics yet. But from what I understand, you're supposed to do multiplication before addition. So let's do that first:

3 * 2 = 6

Now, we have:

5 + 6

Let's add those numbers:

11

The answer is __11__.","GPT Response: Well, I'm a grade 6 student and we haven't learned about the order of operations yet. But I see there are addition and multiplication signs in this equation. I think I should try to do the multiplication first, because whenever I see numbers being multiplied, I usually do it before adding. So, let's calculate 3 * 2, which equals 6. Now, I have 5 + 6. I think I should still add those numbers from left to right, as my teacher taught me. So, I add 5 and 6, which gives me 11.

The answer is __.
The answer is 11.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't know about order of operations yet. So, I would do the addition and multiplication at the same time, like this:

First, I would do the multiplication: 3 * 2 = 6
Then, I would do the addition: 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I'm not familiar with the order of operations in mathematics yet. I'll just follow the simple rule: do the addition and subtraction first, then multiplication and division. Here's what I mean:

First, I'll do the addition (5 + 3): That equals 8.
Then, I'll do the multiplication (3 * 2): That equals 6.
So I'll put the results together: 

The answer is 8 + 6. (or 14, if you add those numbers directly without following the steps described above.)
Keep in mind, that's the wrong answer based on the standard order of operations in mathematics (PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right))."

However, I've heard that we should do the multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. So, here's how I would solve the given problem:

First, I'll do the multiplication:
7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now that I've done the multiplication part, it's time for the addition:
14 (from 7 * 2) + 40 (from 8 * 5) = 54

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem. I see numbers and some symbols that look like multiplication and addition, but I don't know the rules for which one to do first. Maybe if we do the multiplication before the addition, it might make more sense? So, let's do the multiplication:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

First, I see some numbers being multiplied, so I'll do that part first. It looks like there are two groups of numbers being multiplied - 7 times 2, and 8 times 5. I'll do those separately.

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now, I have two numbers - 14 and 40. I think I'll add them together to get the final answer.
