4 * 3 = 12

Now, I have 12 + 2. Hmm, I know I'm supposed to add 2 to 12, but I don't know why. My teacher just says it's the way it is. So, I'll add 2 to 12.

12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14."

First, I see some numbers and signs that I know how to work with. Let's start with the addition part inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.

Next, I see the multiplication symbol, which means I need to multiply 4 and 7. That gives me 28.

Now, I see a subtraction sign and the number 2. I know I need to subtract 2 from 28, so that gives me 26.

Finally, I see the last addition sign and the number 12. Adding 12 to 26 gives me 38.

The answer is 38!"
