That would give me 8 and 20. Then, I would add the numbers I multiplied together: 2+5, which is 7. Now, I would do the multiplication again with the result I just got (7) and the number I have left (3): 7*3 = 21.<br><br>Next, I would do the addition: 8 and 20, which equals 28.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not exactly an expert on this, but I think I should do what the teacher told us during our math lesson.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure what the rules are for doing this math problem, but I think I should do the multiplication first since there are numbers being multiplied.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what those funny letters stand for, but my teacher said we need to follow some rules when doing math with parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, and addition or subtraction. Let's give it a try with this problem: 5 + 2 * 4.<br><br>First, we look for any parentheses, but there aren't any. Next, we check for exponents, but we don't have any of those either. Since there's no multiplication inside any addition or subtraction, we just follow the rule that multiplication should be done before addition, also known as the PEMDAS rule. So, we'll do the multiplication first: 2 * 4 = 8. Now, we add the numbers: 5 + 8 = 13.<br><br>The answer is __.<br>Answer: 13.</td>

But let's go with what the asterisk suggests for now: The answer is 13.<br><br>However, this technique might not always be correct and could lead to incorrect answers with more complicated expressions, as there is a systematic rule called the "PEMDAS" algorithm that helps us solve expressions more accurately, and following it is essential to ensure the proper execution of Mathematical operations. I will share this information with my teacher and my classmates when we learn about order of operations in the future.<br><br>The answer is 13, but keep in mind that this technique may not apply to all Mathematical problems.</td>

It looks like there's addition and multiplication, so let's figure out which one to do first. Hmmm... I think maybe I should do the multiplication before the addition because the numbers are next to each other in the multiplication operation (3*2). That makes a total of 6.

Then, I'll do the addition because the "+ sign" is there, so that's 5 plus 6, which makes it 11. The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I see some numbers and some symbols here. Let's try to figure it out. I know that numbers go in a row and do simple addition first. So, I will do the addition part first: 5 + 3. That gives me 8. Then I see the * symbol, which means multiplication. So, I will do the multiplication part next: 3 * 2. That gives me 6. Now, I have 8 and 6, and I'm not quite sure what to do next, but I guess I should combine those two parts. I was told to do addition before multiplication, so I will add the numbers I got from the addition part and the first multiplication part: 8 + 6. That gives me 14. The answer is 14.</td>
