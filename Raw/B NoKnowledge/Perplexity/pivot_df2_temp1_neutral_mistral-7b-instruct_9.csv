mistral-7b-instruct,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I don't know about the order of operations rule (PEMDAS) yet. But I can try to solve the problem by guessing which operations to do first, second, and so on. Here's how I'd attempt it:

First, I'd do the operation inside the parentheses because I've learned that parentheses should be done first.

2 + 5 = 7

So, the problem becomes:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Now I'd do the multiplication because, in my mind, it seems easier to do that before addition and subtraction.

4 * 7 = 28
28 * 3 = 84

So, the problem now looks like:

28 + 12 - 84

Next, I'd do the addition and subtraction from left to right since I believe that's how it should be done.

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 84 = -44

So, finally, the answer should be:

The answer is -44.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I don't know about the order of operations yet. I'll just do the arithmetic from left to right as it's written.

First, I'll do the parentheses:
2 + 5 equals 7.

So the equation becomes:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I'll do multiplication:
4 * 7 equals 28.

Now, I'll do subtraction:
12 - 2 equals 10.

Lastly, I'll do addition:
28 + 10 equals 38.

The answer is 38.","GPT Response: Well, I'm just an elementary school student, and I haven't learned about the order of operations yet. But I can try to solve this problem by doing the operations inside the parentheses first, then any multiplication or division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right. Let's see:

1. First, I'll do the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7
2. Now, I'll do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28
3. Then, the subtraction: 28 + 12 = 40
4. Lastly, the remaining multiplication: 4 * 3 = 12
5. Now, I'll do the last subtraction: 40 - 12 = 28

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: As a third grader, I don't understand the order of operations yet, but I can follow numbers from left to right and do simple addition and multiplication. Let's solve the expression step by step.

First, let's do the addition inside the parentheses:

2 + 5 = 7

Now, we have:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we do the multiplication:

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now it looks like this:
28 + 12 - 6

Then we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Well, I've never heard of PEMDAS before, but this problem seems to have some numbers and some symbols. I guess I should do the multiplication first, because it's there before the addition, right? So, I'll do 4 times 3, which equals 12. Now, I've got 12 and a 2. I think addition comes next, so I'll add those numbers together: 12 + 2 equals 14. So, the answer is...

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Hmm, this looks like a math problem. But I'm just a grade 6 student, and I don't know what those funny letters mean in PEMDAS. Let's just do this step by step, shall we?

First, I see a multiplication sign (x) between 4 and 3. I guess I should do that first, right? So:

12 (4 x 3)

Now, I see a plus sign (+) between the result and 2. I guess I should add those numbers up? So:

14 (12 + 2)

The answer is __.
Answer: 14.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't know about order of operations yet. But I can try to solve the problem by doing what seems logical to me. I'll do the multiplication first because I think that's what you do before addition. So, I'll do 4 times 3, which equals 12. Then I'll add 2 to that answer. So, 12 plus 2 equals 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: I see numbers and symbols on this paper, but I'm not sure what they mean yet. I remember seeing my teacher write similar things on the board sometimes. Let's try to do this step by step.

First, I see the number 4 with a little star next to it. I think that means I should do something to the number 3 that's next to it. Since there's a multiplication symbol (*) between them, I remember that means I need to ""multiply"" the numbers.

So, I'll do that.. 

The answer for the multiplication is: 4 * 3 = 12

Now, I have 12 and a plus sign (+) and the number 2. I remember hearing my teacher say that addition comes before multiplication, so I should add 2 to 12 first.

So, I'll add 2 to 12:

The answer for the addition is: 12 + 2 = 14

The answer is: 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Well, I'm just a grade 6 student, so I'm not really sure what this ""order of operations"" thing is all about. But I do know that when we do math problems, some operations need to be done before others. For example, multiplication and division should be done before addition and subtraction.

So, in the problem 5 + 2 * 4, we need to do the multiplication first because of that rule. So, 2 * 4 equals 8, and then we add 5 to get the final answer.

The answer is 13. (Actually, I made a mistake here, the correct answer using PEMDAS is 14, but I'm just a 6th grader and I follow the rule of 'multiplication and division first' not knowing it's specifically PEMDAS)","GPT Response: Well, I'm just a 6th grader and I haven't learned about the special order we follow when doing math yet. Let's just try to do this problem step by step, shall we? I'd start with the multiplication, because to me, it seems like it should be done before the addition. So, I'll do 2 multiplied by 4 which equals 8. After that, I'll add 5 to the result. So, the sum of 5 plus 2 times 4 is:

The answer is 13. But wait a minute, something seems off! Maybe I should've done the addition first? I guess I need to ask my teacher about this rule called PEMDAS... Let's hope I didn't mess this up too badly!","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations in mathematics. I would approach this problem by doing the simpler operations first, from left to right.

So, I'll do the addition first: 5 + 2

Then, I'll do the multiplication: 2 * 4

Now, I have the results of the simpler operations, which are 7 and 8. So, I add the results together: 7 + 8

The answer is: 15.","GPT Response: Well, I know that in mathematics we have to follow some rules when we do calculations, but I'm not sure what those rules are called yet. But I think I can still try to figure out this problem. Let's see, the plus sign (5 +) means we have to add, and the asterisk (*) means we have to multiply. So, I guess I should do the multiplication first and then the addition. That would mean I'd do 2 times 4 first, which is 8, and then add 5 to it. So, the answer is...

The answer is: 5 + 2*4 = 8 + 5 = 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations in mathematics, so I'll try to solve the problem based on what I know so far. Since addition and multiplication are the only operations involved, I'll do them from left to right as I read the equation.

First, I'll do the multiplication: 3*2 = 6
Then, I'll do the addition: 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I don't know about the order of operations yet. I see an addition sign and two multiplication signs in this equation. I guess I should do the multiplication first since it's there more than once, right? But what if it changes the result of the addition? Let's try it out!

First, I'll do the multiplication:
3 * 2 = 6

Now I'll do the addition:
5 + 6 = 11

So here's my attempt at solving the equation with no knowledge of the order of operations:

The answer is 11.

However, my answer might not be correct based on the rules of PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction). Let's hope my teacher will correct me if necessary!","GPT Response: Well, I'm just a little elementary school student, so I don't really know about all those fancy rules like PEMDAS yet. But I think I can still figure out this addition and multiplication problem. Here's what I'd do:

First, I'd do the multiplication because, you know, my mom always told me to do my homework in the order it's given, and this comes before the addition (maybe that's why it's called ""multiplication""?) So, 3 times 2 equals 6.

Now, I'd do the addition. So, 5 plus 6. That equals 11.

The answer is __.
(11)","GPT Response: Well, I know that in math we sometimes need to follow a certain rule to make sure we get the correct answer. This rule is called the order of operations, or PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). But since I don't know this rule yet, let me try to solve this problem without it:

I see that I have an addition sign (+) and a multiplication sign (*). I guess I'll do the multiplication first since there are numbers next to each other without any other signs and that seems like what I do in other situations. So:

3*2 = 6

Now, I have this: 5 + 6. I remember that addition comes before subtraction, so I'll do that:

5 + 6 = 11

So, the answer is: The answer is 11. But I'm not completely sure if that's right because I didn't follow the correct order of operations. Maybe I'll ask my teacher to help me understand the rules better next time!"
mistral-7b-instruct,1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem since I don't know about order of operations yet. But let me try to do this step by step, just adding the numbers I see first:

2. Then add the results of the multiplication: 14 + 40

The answer is: The answer is 54.

However, I don't know about this thing called PEMDAS order yet. Let's try to solve the problem step by step as if I were doing this on my own:

1. First, I'll do the multiplications since I saw them there:
   - 7 * 2 = 14
   - 8 * 5 = 40
2. Now, I'll do the addition:
   - 14 (from the first multiplication) + 40 (from the second multiplication) = 54

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I might try to do the addition and multiplication parts first, because I see those symbols (+ and ×) closer to each other than to the numbers or the other symbol (∗). I would do the multiplication parts first, because the Multiplication sign (×) looks like it should be done before the addition sign (+). So I would do:

7 * 2 = __
8 * 5 = __

(I would multiply 2 and 7 first in the first multiplication, then multiply 5 and 8 in the second multiplication)

The answer to 7 * 2 would be 14, and the answer to 8 * 5 would be 40.

Next, I would do the addition part, adding those numbers I got from the multiplication parts:

14 + 40 = __
