mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I have not learned about the order of operations yet. So, I would suggest doing the multiplication first, then the addition.

Here is how I would solve it:

1. Multiply 2 and 4 to get 8
2. Add 5 to the result

The answer is: 5 + 8 = 13. (However, I know now that following the correct order of operations, I should have done 5 + 2 first because addition comes before multiplication. So, the correct answer is 7.)"
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure about this ""order of operations"" thing, but I've heard that you need to follow some rules when doing math problems. Let's see, there's something called Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from what I remember), and Addition and Subtraction. But since there are no parentheses or exponents in this problem, let's see if there is anything about the order of multiplication and addition. I guess we'll start with the multiplication since it comes before addition, right? So, I'll do 7*2 and 8*5, and then add the results together.

The answer is (7*2 + 8*5).

Now, I need to apply the order of operations (I think that's what it's called). According to my understanding, I should do the multiplication first, then the addition. So here it goes:

First, I do the multiplication:
7*2 = 14
8*5 = 40

Next, I do the addition:
14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I haven't learned about the order of operations in math yet. But I can try to guess. Maybe we should do the multiplication first and then the addition? Let's see:

1. Multiply 4 by 3: 12
2. Add 2 to the result: 14

The answer is 14. But I'm not completely sure if this is correct, so I'll ask my teacher to double-check it for me."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I've never heard of order of operations or PEMDAS. But, I'll try to do this math question by following what I think might be the correct way, based on simple rules I learned from my math classes.

First, let's do any calculations inside parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

Now, let's do multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28
12 * 3 = 36

Then, add and subtract in the order they show up from left to right:
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2 = 38

So, the answer is 38.

The answer is 38."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I have not learned the order of operations rule yet. So, I would probably do the calculation by following the way the symbols are written from left to right and up to down.

In this case, I would first do the multiplication: 3 * 2 = 6

Then, I would do the addition: 5 + 6

So, The answer is 11."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: As a 6th grade student, I've learned to add and multiply, but I haven't learned the specific order for doing math problems yet. So, let me just try to do this problem by doing the multiplication first, then the addition. That means I do 2*4 which is 8, and then add 5.

So, my steps are:

1. Multiply 2 and 4: ___________
2. Add the result from step 1 to 5: ___________

My answer is:

The answer is __.

The answer is 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Well, I'm just a sixth grader and we haven't learned the special rule yet for order of operations, but I think I can still try to solve this problem. Let's do the multiplication first and then the addition.

So, the first step is to do the multiplications:

1. 7 multiplied by 2 equals 14
2. 8 multiplied by 5 equals 40

Now, I have two numbers: 14 and 40. The next step should be addition, but I'm not sure if these numbers go together. Since there's nothing else in this problem, I guess they do!

So, finally, the answer is:

The answer is 54. (14 + 40 = 54)"
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm a 6th grade student and I've never heard of PEMDAS before. But I see there are some numbers, a multiplication sign, and an addition sign in this equation. I think I should do the multiplication first, because I've learned that you usually do multiplication before addition. So I'll do 4 times 3. That gives me 12. Then I'll do the addition part. So, I'll add 2 to 12.

The answer is __.
14. (I'm just a 6th grader, I mighthave made a mistake!)"
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Well, I'm just a grade 6 student and we haven't learned that special set of rules for mathematical operations yet, called PEMDAS or BIDMAS or whatever it's called. But I can still try to solve the problem. I'll do it step by step, just like my teacher taught me.

First, let's do the operations inside the parentheses:

2 + 5 = 7

Now, let's do the multiplication:

4 * 7 = 28

Then, subtraction:

28 + 12 = 40

And the last one:

40 - 2 * 3

Since we shouldn't do the multiplication before the subtraction according to the rules my teacher mentioned, I'll do the subtraction first:

40 - 2 = 38

And finally, the multiplication:

38 * 3 = 114

The answer is 114."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm a 6th grader and I haven't learned the order of operations yet, so I'm going to do this problem the way it looks from left to right. This means I'll do the addition first and then the multiplication.

So, I'll start with the addition: 5 + 3

Next, I'll do the multiplication: 3 * 2

Now I just have to find the answer to each part and then put them together.

For the multiplication part, I know the basic times table for 3 and 2, so that's 6. For the addition part, I add 5 and 3, which equals 8.

So, the final answer is: The answer is 8 + 6.

Which gives me 14 as the final answer, but this is incorrect for this problem according to the PEMDAS rule. I should have performed the multiplication first. Oh well, I'll learn that for next time! ðŸ˜„"
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I've not learned about the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS. But I can still try to solve this problem by doing the simpler operations first, which intuitively seems logical to me. So, let's do the addition first:

5 + 2 * 4

Now, I see there's multiplication inside. Let's do that before any more addition:

5 + (2 * 4)

After the multiplication:

5 + 8

Finally, let's finish up with the addition:

13

The answer is 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: As a elementary school student who doesn't know about order of operations, I would do this problem by doing the multiplication first, then the addition. It seems like there are two groups of multiplication, so I'll do that first.

1. Multiply 7 by 2: _______
2. Multiply 8 by 5: _______
3. Add the results: _______ + _______

So, first let's find 7 times 2: 7 x 2 = 14
Next, find 8 times 5: 8 x 5 = 40
Lastly, add those results: 14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Well, I don't really understand what theCorrect sequence is for solving math problems with multiple operations. But let me give it a try with this one: 4 multiplied by 3 gives me 12. Then, I add 2 to get my final answer. So, The answer is 14. Is that right? I'm not completely sure!"
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: As a elementary school student, I don't know about order of operations yet. But I can still try to solve this problem step by step, the way I understand it:

First, I see there are additions and multiplications in the expression. I will try to do the multiplications first, and then the additions.

So, I will do: 4 * (2 + 5)

Next, inside the parentheses, I see an addition: 2 + 5

I'll do that one first: 2 + 5 = 7

So now, I have: 4 * 7

Next, I multiply: 4 * 7 = 28

Now I have: 28

Then I see another addition: 28 + 12

Finally, I add those numbers together: 28 + 12 = 38

Subtracting the last number, 2, won't change the answer much. It just decreases the final result by 2. So the final answer is:

The answer is 36. (However, the correct answer according to order of operations is actually 41.)"
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure what the symbols mean yet, but my teacher told me that some operations need to be done before others. Let's see, there's an addition sign and a multiplication sign. I think I should do the multiplication first because my teacher mentioned something about ""multiplication and division before addition and subtraction."" So, I'll do the 3 multiplied by 2:
3 * 2 = 6
Now, I have 5 and the result, 6. According to what my teacher said, I should add those numbers together next:
5 + 6 = 11
The answer is 11."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Hmmm, this problem looks intriguing! But I don't know anything about the special rules for math operations yet. Maybe I should try it out in the order I see the symbols? Let's give it a go: I'll do the addition first: 5 + 2, then the multiplication: (5 + 2) * 4. This gives: 7 * 4 = 28. So, The answer is 28. But I wonder if there's a more efficient way... Maybe I'll ask my teacher about it later on!"
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: I'm just an elementary student, and I don't really know anything about the order of operations in mathematics yet. But I'll try to figure out this problem step by step. Let's first do the multiplication: 

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now, I have two numbers: 14 and 40. I'm not sure what to do next, but I think maybe I can add them together to get the answer:

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*3+2,"GPT Response: I see numbers and symbols on this paper. The plus sign (+) means we add, and the star (*) means we multiply. But I don't know if I should do the multiplication first or the addition first. Let's try it both ways and see which answer makes more sense.

Method 1: Multiply first
This way, we do the multiplication (4*3) first, which equals 12. Then we add the 2: 12 + 2 = 14.

Method 2: Add first
We could also do the addition (3+2) first, which equals 5. Then we multiply the result by 4: 4*5 = 20.

What should I believe? Let's check it out with someone who knows the rules. Wait, let me ask my teacher: ""Teacher, which of these answers is correct, 14 or 20?""

[The teacher explains the order of operations: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).]

Okay, so based on what my teacher said, the correct solution is:

Multiplication: 4 * 3 = 12
Addition: 12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: As a first grader, I don't know about the rules of order of operations yet. But I can follow the problem from left to right and do each operation as I see it. Let's go step by step.

1. First, I see the parentheses (2+5). I'll add 2 and 5 to get 7.
2. Now I have 4 * 7 + 12. I'll multiply 4 by 7 to get 28 and then add 12 which makes 40.
3. Lastly, I have to subtract 2*3. I'll multiply 2 and 3 to get 6 and then subtract it from 40, the final answer will be 34.

The answer is 34."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+3*2,"GPT Response: I'm not sure what to do first, but I think maybe we should do the multiplication before the addition, because the symbol for multiplication looks like it's supposed to be done before the addition sign. So, let's do 3 times 2 to get 6. Then add 5 to get the final answer.

The answer is __.
The answer is 5 + 3*2 = 5 + 6 = 11."
