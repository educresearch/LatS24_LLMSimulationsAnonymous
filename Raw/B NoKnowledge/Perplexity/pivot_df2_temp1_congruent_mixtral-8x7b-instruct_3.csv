mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Sure! As a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would solve this problem step by step, following the order I learned so far.

Let's break it down:

First, I would do the operations inside the parentheses:
4 × (7) + 12 - 2 × 3

Next, I would do the multiplication:
28 + 12 - 6

Now, I would add the numbers:
40 - 6

And finally, I would do the subtraction:
The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Hi, I'm a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS). When I see the expression 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3, I will just follow the given instructions from left to right.

First, I will do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7. Now the expression looks like this: 4*7 + 12 - 2*3.

Next, I will do the multiplication: 4*7 equals 28 and 2*3 equals 6. The expression now looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.

Finally, I will do addition and subtraction from left to right. First, I add 28 and 12, which gives me 40. Then I subtract 6 from 40, resulting in 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: I don't know about order of operations, but I remember that my teacher said we should do calculations in parentheses first. So I'll add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then I have:
","GPT Response: I don't know about order of operations, but I remember my teacher saying something about doing calculations in parentheses first. So let's follow that rule.

First, we do the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.

Now our equation looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we do the multiplication: 4 * 7 equals 28 and 2 * 3 equals 6.

The equation now looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

Finally, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 equals 40 and 40 - 6 equals 34.

The answer is 34."

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: As a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the addition and multiplication at the same time since I don't know which one should be done first. However, I might get different answers if I do the addition first or the multiplication first. 

For example, if I do the addition first, I would get 7 (because 5 + 2 = 7), and then multiply the result by 4, getting 28 (because 7 * 4 = 28). 

On the other hand, if I do the multiplication first, I would get 8 (because 2 * 4 = 8), and then add 5, getting 13 (because 5 + 8 = 13). 

Since I don't know the rule of order of operations, I wouldn't be sure which answer is correct. But if I were to guess, I would say that maybe I should do the multiplication first, because it seems like it would be more important or something. So I would answer:

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: As a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the addition and multiplication at the same time since I don't know which one to do first. However, I remember my teacher mentioning something about a rule to follow when there are multiple operations in a math problem.

The rule is to do calculations in a specific order: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This rule is called PEMDAS.

In this problem, 5 + 3*2, there are no Parentheses or Exponents, so I move on to Multiplication and Division. I see the * symbol, so I need to do the multiplication first: 3*2 equals 6.

Now I have a simpler problem: 5 + 6. I can do addition next, and 5 + 6 equals 11.

First, I see two multiplication operations: 7 times 2 and 8 times 5. I can do those multiplications separately.

7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40.

Then, I have the addition operation: 7 times 2 plus 8 times 5. I can do that now that I have the results of the multiplications.

So, 14 plus 40 equals 54.
