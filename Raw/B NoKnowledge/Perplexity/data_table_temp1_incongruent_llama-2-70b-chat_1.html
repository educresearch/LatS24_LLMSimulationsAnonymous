Then I see 8 + 5, which is 13. Next, I see 13 + 12, which is 25. Finally, I see 25 - 2 * 3, which is 25 - 6, which is 19.<br><br>So, the answer is 19.<br><br>I hope that's right!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 multiplication symbol, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 2+5. That gives me 4 x 7 = 28.<br><br>Next, I see the addition symbol, so I'll add 12 to 28. That gives me 40.<br><br>Finally, I see the subtraction symbol, so I'll subtract 2 times 3 from 40. That gives me 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.<br><br>I hope that's correct! Can someone tell me what this PEMDAS thing is and why it's important?</td>

Okay, let's see...<br><br>I think I should start by adding 2 and 5 because it says to do that first. That's 7.<br><br>Then, it says to multiply 4 by 7, which is 28.<br><br>Next, it says to subtract 2 times 3, which is 6.<br><br>So, 28 - 6 is 22.<br><br>The answer is 22!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, let's see...<br><br>First, we have to do the things inside the parentheses. That's just how it works. So, we have 2+5, which is 7.<br><br>Next, we multiply 4 by 7, which is 28.<br><br>Then, we have 12 - 2 times 3, which is 12 - 6, which is 6.<br><br>Finally, we add 28 and 6, which is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what this "PEMDAS" thing is, but I do know that when you have a bunch of numbers and operations in a problem, you gotta follow some rules to make sure you do the right calculations first!<br><br>Okay, so in this problem, there are a few things going on. There's a 5, a 2, a 4, and some multiplication and addition symbols. I think you're supposed to do the multiplication first, so let's see... 2 times 4 is 8!<br><br>Now, there's this thing called "order of operations" that says you gotta do the multiplication before the addition. So, we've got 8 from the multiplication, and now we need to add 5 and 2. That's easy - 5 plus 2 is 7!<br><br>So, the answer is... 7 + 8 = 15! Woohoo, I did it! The answer is 15!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it my best shot.<br><br>So, the problem is 5 + 2 * 4, right? Well, first I'll add 5 and 2, that's easy, it's 7. Then, I have 7 * 4, which is 28.<br><br>So, the answer is 28!<br><br>I know, I know, you're thinking, "But what about PEMDAS?" Sorry, I don't know what that means. Maybe you can teach me after we finish this problem? ðŸ˜…<br><br>The answer is 28. ðŸ˜Š</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...<br><br>Okay, so we have 5 and 2, and we need to add them together. That's easy, it's 7!<br><br>But wait, there's more! We have 4 multiply 2, that's 8.<br><br>So, we add 7 and 8, and we get... 15!<br><br>The answer is 15.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! So, I know that when we do math, we have to follow some rules. One of those rules is that we have to do things in a certain order. It's like following a recipe for your favorite meal. You have to do the steps in the right order or it won't turn out right.<br><br>In this problem, we have a few things happening. We have a 5 and a 2, and then we have a multiplication sign. That means we have to multiply the 2 and the 4. So, we do that first.<br><br>2 x 4 = 8<br><br>Now, we have our answer to the multiplication part, which is 8. But we're not done yet! We still have the 5 left over. So, we add the 5 to the 8.<br><br>5 + 8 = 13<br><br>The answer is 13!</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this...<br><br>Okay, I know that when we add numbers, we have to do it in a specific order. Like, if we have 2 apples and we add 3 more apples, we get 5 apples. So, in this question, we have 5 and 3, and we need to add them together.<br><br>But then there's this funny symbol called multiplication. I'm not really sure what it does, but I think it makes the numbers bigger. Like, if we have 2 apples and we multiply them by 3, we get 6 apples! That's a lot of apples!<br><br>So, in this question, we have 3 * 2, and that means we need to multiply 3 and 2 together.
