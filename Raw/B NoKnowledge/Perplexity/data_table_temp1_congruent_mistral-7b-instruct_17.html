      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just a student in elementary school, so I don't know much about the specific rules for order of operations in math yet. But I can try to do the problem based on what looks logical to me, like doing the operations inside the parentheses first, then any exponent, followed by multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction. That's how it seems to me when I see numbers with different types of symbols. So, let's give it a try:<br><br>First, I'll do the operations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.<br><br>Now I'll calculate the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28.<br><br>Next, I'll do the subtraction: 12 - 2 = 10.<br><br>Finally, I'll do the remaining addition: 28 + 10 = 38.<br><br>The answer is 38.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what PEMDAS means, but my teacher told me to follow some rules when doing math problems. Let's see, there are parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction, right? But in this problem, I don't see any parentheses or exponents, so I think I should do the multiplication first since it comes before addition according to those rules, right? So, I'll multiply 4 and 3 which gives me 12. Then, I add 2 to that result. So, The answer is 12 + 2 = 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure what the steps are for doing this kind of math problem, but I'll try to figure it out by doing the multiplication first and then adding the numbers.

      <td>GPT Response: I'm only an elementary school student, so I don't really know about the special rules for math problems called order of operations.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm a grade 6 student and I haven't learned about the order of operations yet. But I think we should do the multiplication before the addition since the * symbol usually means to do multiplication first, right? So, let me first calculate 2*4 which equals to 8. Then, I add 5 to the result. <br><br>So the answer is:<br>The answer is 5 + 2*4 = 5 + 8 = 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just a sixth grader and I've never heard of PEMDAS or order of operations before. But let me give it a try based on what I think makes sense:<br><br>Since the * sign is there before the + sign, I believe we should do the multiplication first. So, I'll do 2 times 4:<br><br>2 * 4 = 8<br><br>Now, I have the number 8, and there's an addition sign next to it. So, I'll add 5 to 8:<br><br>8 + 5 = 13<br><br>The answer is __.<br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure about any special rules for this problem, but let me give it a try. I see there's an addition sign and a multiplication sign. Usually, we do multiplication before addition, right? So, I'll do the multiplication first: 2*4 equals 8. Then I have 5 plus 8. That means I add 5 and 8, which gives me 13.<br><br>The answer is __13__.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I've got this equation here, 5 plus 2 times 4. Let's break it down. First, I think we should do the multiplication part because we learned that we should do that before addition and subtraction, right? So, 2 times 4 makes 8. Now, let's go back to the equation: 5 + 8. This time, it's clear that we're supposed to do addition, so 5 plus 8 is 13. The answer is __.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means or which operations to do first. But, I've heard that in mathematics, sometimes we need to follow a specific order to solve an expression. Let's try to figure it out step by step.<br><br>First, let's identify the operations present in the expression: addition (5 +) and multiplication (3*2). Based on what I have learned so far, I think we should perform multiplication before addition. So, let's do the multiplication first.<br><br>3 * 2 = 6<br><br>Now, we have: 5 + 6<br><br>But, I still don't know if we should do addition before or after doing multiplication in this case.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just a 6th grader and we haven't learned about the order of operations yet. But let's try to figure this one out based on what I do know.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I've heard that in mathematics, sometimes we need to follow certain rules to solve an expression correctly. But honestly, I've never learned anything about that yet. I would just add the numbers I see first, and then multiply. So, let me add 5 and 3: 5 + 3 = 8. Now, I'll multiply 3 and 2: 3 * 2 = 6. And finally, I'll add the results: 8 + 6 = 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.<br>(I hope that's the right way to do it!)</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure what to do first in this equation. I know how to add and how to multiply, but I don't know which operation to do first. Maybe I should ask my teacher or look it up. Anyway, I think I'll try this: I'll do the multiplication first, and then the addition. So, it will look like this: 3 multiplied by 2 equals 6. Then, I add 5 to 6. So the answer would be: 5 + 6 = 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
