      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this...<br><br>Okay, I know I have to follow some rules to solve this problem, but I'm not sure what they are. I think I should do the multiplication first, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 2 + 5. That gives me 4*7 = 28.<br><br>Next, I need to add 12 to 28, so that's 40.<br><br>Now, I need to subtract 2 times 3 from 40. That's 2*3 = 6, so I'll subtract 6 from 40.<br><br>The answer is 34.<br><br>I hope that's correct! Can you tell me if I did it right?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! So, I've got this math problem here, and I'm not really sure how to do it. I've heard of this thing called PEMDAS, but I don't really know what it means or how to use it. Can you help me out?<br><br>Okay, so the problem is 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3. I think I should start by adding 2 and 5 together, so that's 7. Then, I should multiply 4 by 7, which is 28. Next, I should add 12 to that, which is 40. Finally, I should subtract 2 times 3, which is 6.<br><br>The answer is 40 - 6, which is 34.<br><br>I hope that's right! Can you tell me if I did it correctly?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, I'm gonna try my best to solve this problem!<br><br>First, I see some numbers and signs, but I don't know what to do with them yet. Let me take a closer look...<br><br>Oh, I see! There's a 4 and a 2, and they're multiplying together! That means I have to put the 2 inside the 4, like this: 4(2). That gives me 8.<br><br>But wait, there's more! There's a plus sign and a 5! That means I have to add the 5 to the 8, like this: 8 + 5 = 13.<br><br>Hmm, what's next? Oh yeah, there's a 12! That's just a number, so I'll write it down: 13 + 12 = 25.<br><br>Now, there's a minus sign and a 2, and it's multiplying with a 3! That means I have to subtract 6 from 25, like this: 25 - 6 = 19.<br><br>And that's it! The answer is 19.<br><br>I hope that's right! Do you think I did it correctly?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! Let's see...<br><br>First, we have to do the multiplication: 4 * (2 + 5) = 4 * 7 = 28.<br><br>Next, we have to add 12: 28 + 12 = 40.<br><br>Finally, we have to subtract 2 times 3: 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to follow some rules when doing math problems, but I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me with that?<br><br>Oh, you said it means "Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction"? That sounds like a lot to remember!<br><br>Okay, let's see... In this problem, there are no parentheses, so we can skip that part. There are no exponents either, so we can move on to the multiplication and division part.<br><br>I see that there's a multiplication sign between 4 and 3, so I'll do that first. 4 multiplied by 3 is 12.<br><br>Now, there's no division sign, so we can move on to the addition and subtraction part. There's only one addition left, which is 2.<br><br>So, 12 + 2 is... hmm... 14!<br><br>The answer is 14!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. I think it has something to do with math, but I'm not sure. Can you help me?<br><br>Okay, so I know that 4*3 means 4 times 3, which is 12. And 2 is just 2. So, if I add 12 and 2 together, I get 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...<br><br>Okay, I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll do the multiplication first.<br>4*3 = 12<br><br>Now, I have 12 + 2 = 14<br><br>The answer is 14!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so we have 4 groups of 3 things, and that's 12 things total.<br>Then we have 2 more things, so that's 14 things total.<br>The answer is 14.</td>

So, the first number on the left is 5, and then there's a multiplication sign. That means we have to do the multiplication before we can add anything else.<br><br>So, 2 times 4 is 8. Now, we can add 5 and 8, and that gives us... 13!<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, but I don't know why. It just seems like the right thing to do.<br><br>So, I'll start by multiplying 2 and 4, which gives me 8.<br><br>Next, I'll add 5 and 8, which gives me 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I think I can help you with that math problem!<br><br>So, first we have 5, and then we have 2 times 4, which is 8. So, we add 5 and 8, and that's 13!<br><br>The answer is 13. ðŸ˜„</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm just a student in elementary school, and I'm not sure what this "order of operations" thing is all about. But I'll give it my best shot!<br><br>So, in this problem, we have 5 + 2*4. I know that 2*4 is equal to 8, because I learned that in my multiplication lessons.<br><br>So, if we add 5 and 8, we get 13.<br><br>The answer is 13!</td>
