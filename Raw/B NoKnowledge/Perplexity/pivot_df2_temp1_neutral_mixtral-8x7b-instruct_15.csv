mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Okay, so I don't know about this ""order of operations"" thing, but I know how to do basic arithmetic. I'll just do the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division from left to right.

First, I'll do the multiplication: 4 times 2 equals 8, and 2 times 3 equals 6. Now the equation looks like this: 8 + 5 + 12 - 6.

Next, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 8 + 5 equals 13, and then 13 + 12 - 6 equals 29 - 6, which is 23.

So, the answer is 23.

The answer is 23.","GPT Response: Hi, I'm a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS). When I see a math problem like this, I try to solve it step by step from left to right. But I found out that some people say I should follow the order: parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), addition and subtraction (from left to right). I'm not sure what that means, but I'll try to do it that way.

First, I'll do the operation in the parentheses, which is 2 + 5. That equals 7.

Now my equation looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I'll do the multiplication and division from left to right. So I'll do 4 * 7 first, which equals 28. Then I'll do 2 * 3, which equals 6.

Now my equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

Finally, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So I'll add 28 + 12, which equals 40. Then I'll subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: I don't know about any special rules for doing math, so I will just do the operations in the order that they appear. I will start by doing the addition inside the parentheses, then multiply and subtract from left to right.

First, I get: 4*(7)+12-2*3
Then, I do: 28+12-2*3
Next, I do: 28+12-6
And finally, I get: 40-6

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: I don't know much about order of operations, but I remember my teacher saying something about a rule called PEMDAS. It stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So let's follow this rule:

First, we do the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.

Now our equation looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we do multiplication and division from left to right: 4 * 7 equals 28, and 2 * 3 equals 6.

The equation now looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, we do addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 6 equals 34.

The answer is 34."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Well, if I didn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would probably just solve this from left to right. So I would first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12, then add 2 to get 14. 

So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a sixth-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will solve this mathematically by doing the operations from left to right.

First, I'll multiply 4 and 3, which gives me 12.

Next, I'll add the result to 2. So, it's 12 + 2.

When I add those numbers together, I get 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: I would start by multiplying 4 and 3 to get 12. Then I would add 2 to get 14. So the answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Well, I don't know much about order of operations yet. But I know that if there's no special signs telling us to do the operations in a certain order, we usually do them from left to right. 

So for this problem, I would first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then I would add 2 to that result. 

Doing this gives me: 12 + 2 = 14. 

So the answer is 14."

Doing this gives me: 7 * 4 = 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Well, as a 6th grade student who doesn't know about order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think that I can just solve this problem from left to right. But I've heard that sometimes, we need to follow certain rules to get the correct answer.

So, if I add 5 and 2, I get 7. Then, I multiply that result by 4. If I do it that way, I get 28.

But, like I said, I heard about these rules and one of them says that you should do multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. So, I should first multiply 2 and 4 to get 8, and then add 5 to get 13.

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: Hmm, I don't know what ""order of operations"" means, but I remember my teacher saying something about doing multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. So, for this question, I would first multiply 2 and 4 to get 8, then add the result to 5.

But I remember my teacher saying something about doing multiplication before addition. So I'll follow that rule.

First, I'll do the multiplication: 3 times 2 equals 6.
Then, I'll do the addition: 5 plus 6 equals 11.

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Well, I'm a student in grade 6 and I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS) in Mathematics. So I will just follow the given operation from left to right.

But I realized that I made a mistake because I didn't follow the correct order of operations.

The correct way to do it is to follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). So I should do the multiplication first, then the addition.
