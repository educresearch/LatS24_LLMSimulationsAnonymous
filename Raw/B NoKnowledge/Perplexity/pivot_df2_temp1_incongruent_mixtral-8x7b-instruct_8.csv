mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: I don't know about any special rules for solving math problems, so I will just do the operations from left to right. 

First, I will do the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.

So the problem now becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I will do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6.

So the problem now becomes: 28 + 12 - 6

Now I will do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40 and 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Okay, so I don't know about order of operations. I'll just do the math from left to right, following the usual order of operations in my head, which is: do calculations inside parentheses first, then exponents (if any), then multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction.

So here we go:

1. First, I see the parentheses: 2 + 5. I'll calculate that. 2 + 5 equals 7.
2. Now I have: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.
3. Next, I see multiplication: 4 * 7. That equals 28.
4. Now I have: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.
5. I still see multiplication: 2 * 3. That equals 6.
6. Now I have: 28 + 12 - 6.
7. Finally, I do addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 equals 40, and then 40 - 6 equals 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: I would start by doing the operations inside the parentheses first, so I would add 2 + 5 to get 7. Then I would have 4 \* 7 + 12 - 2 \* 3.

Next, I would do the multiplication and division from left to right, so I would do 4 \* 7 first to get 28, and then 2 \* 3 to get 6. Then I would have 28 + 12 - 6.

Finally, I would do the addition and subtraction from left to right, so I would do 28 + 12 first to get 40, and then subtract 6 to get 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Hmm, I'm not sure about this order of operations thing, but let me give it a try!

First, I see some parentheses, so I'll do the operations inside them: 2 + 5 equals 7.

Now it looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, I notice that there are still parentheses, so I'll do the operations inside them again: 4 * 7 equals 28 and 2 * 3 equals 6.

So now it looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.

I can do addition and subtraction from left to right, so I'll start by adding 28 and 12, which gives me 40.

Then, I'll subtract 6 from 40, which leaves me with 34.

The answer is 34."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: At first, I might think the answer is 14 because I would do the multiplication and addition from left to right. But I know that's not the correct way to solve it.

I remember my teacher telling me about something called ""order of operations"" or PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So for this question, I would do the multiplication first (4 * 3 = 12), then the addition (12 + 2 = 14).

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will solve this problem step by step.

7 * 2 = 14
14 + 8 * 5 = 14 + 40

Then, I would do the remaining addition:

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a 6th-grader who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS) yet. When I see this problem, 7 * 2 + 8 * 5, I would probably solve it from left to right, like I've been doing for simpler problems.

So, first, I would do 7 * 2, which equals 14.
Then, I'd add the next part, 8 * 5, which equals 40.

Finally, I'd add those two results together: 14 + 40.

The answer is 54.

Remember, this is how I'd approach it as a 6th-grader who hasn't learned about the order of operations (PEMDAS) yet. But once you learn about PEMDAS, you'll know this isn't the correct way to solve math problems like this one!","GPT Response: Oh boy, I don't know much about order of operations, but I remember my teacher saying something about PEMDAS. I think that means we need to do parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and then addition and subtraction (from left to right).

First, I'll do the two multiplication problems: 7 times 2 and 8 times 5. That gives me 14 and 40.

Now, I'll add those two results together: 14 plus 40.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Well, I don't know much about this order of operations thing, but I know that multiplication is kind of like a stronger operation than addition. So for this problem, I think we should do the multiplication parts first.
