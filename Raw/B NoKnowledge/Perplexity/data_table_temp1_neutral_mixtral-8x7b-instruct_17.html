      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I don't know about this order of operations thing, but I'll just do the problem step by step. I'll start with the operations inside the parentheses first, then do the multiplication and addition from left to right.<br><br>First, I'll add 2 + 5, which is 7. The new equation is:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Now I'll multiply 4 * 7, which is 28. The new equation is:<br><br>28 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I'll add 28 + 12, which is 40. The new equation is:<br><br>40 - 2 * 3<br><br>Then, I'll multiply 2 * 3, which is 6. The new equation is:<br><br>40 - 6<br><br>Finally, I'll subtract 40 - 6, which is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hi, I'm a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations in Mathematics yet. When I see the problem 4*(2+5)+12-2*3, I will just solve it from left to right, following the natural order of operations that I know so far.<br><br>First, I will do the operation inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5, to get 7. Then, I will multiply that result by 4 to get 28. Next, I will add 12 to that result to get 40.

      <td>GPT Response: If I was given this math problem and didn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would solve the problem from left to right. This is called "ordinary computation" or "order of operations without considering the hierarchy of operations".<br><br>So, I would do the multiplication and addition in order from left to right:<br><br>4 \* (2 + 5) = 4 \* 7 = 28<br>2 + 5 = 7<br>28 + 12 = 40<br>40 - 2 \* 3 = 40 - 6 = 34<br><br>The answer is 34.<br><br>But actually, I made a mistake here because I didn't follow the order of operations, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). I needed to do the operation inside the parentheses first before doing the multiplication outside. The correct order of operations should be:<br><br>2 + 5 = 7<br>4 \* 7 = 28<br>28 + 12 = 40<br>40 - 2 \* 3 = 40 - 6 = 34<br><br>The answer is still 34, but I got this answer by following the correct order of operations (PEMDAS).
