Can someone explain it to me like I'm five?\n\nOkay, so imagine you have five apples and your friend has three apples. If you want to know how many apples you both have altogether, you need to add your apples together. That's the \"+\" sign. It means \"add.\" So, 5 + 3 is like asking how many apples you and your friend have altogether.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch! Your friend has three apples, but they're not just regular apples. They're magic apples that multiply when you touch them. So, when you touch your friend's three apples, they turn into six apples! That's the \"*\" sign. It means \"multiply.\" So, 3 * 2 means your friend has six apples now.\n\nNow, we need to add your apples to your friend's apples. Remember, you have five apples, and your friend has six apples. If you add them together, you get eleven apples! That's the answer: 5 + 3 * 2 = 11.\n\nThe answer is 11."}]}]
