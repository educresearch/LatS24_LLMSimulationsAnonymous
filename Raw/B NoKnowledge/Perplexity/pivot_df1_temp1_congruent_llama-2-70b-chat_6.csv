Okay, I know that when you have addition and multiplication in a problem, you're supposed to do the multiplication first. So, I'll do the multiplication part: 2 x 4 = 8.

Now, I have 5 + 8. I know that when you have addition, you're supposed to add the numbers in the correct order. So, I'll add 5 and 8: 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13."

Okay, so I see a bunch of numbers and symbols here. I know I need to follow some rules to get the right answer. I think I need to do the multiplication first, so I'll start with the 7*2. That gives me 14.

Next, I see the 8*5. I'll do that one next. That gives me 40.

Now, I need to add 14 and 40. That gives me... hmm... 54!

So, the answer is 54.

I hope that's right! Can someone please tell me if I did it correctly? ðŸ˜…"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that multiplying comes before adding, so I'll do the multiplication first.

4*3 = 12

Now, I have 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I've been told to answer this math question using PEMDAS, which I think means ""Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally."" I'm not really sure what that means, but I'll do my best to solve the problem!

Okay, so the first thing I see is 4 times 2 plus 5. That's easy! 4 times 2 is 8, and then if I add 5, it's 13.

Next, I see plus 12. That means I just add 12 to whatever I had before, which is 13. So, that's 25.

Now, there's a minus sign! Minus 2 times 3. Hmm... 2 times 3 is 6, and then if I subtract 6 from 25, I get 19.

So, the answer is... 19!

The answer is 19."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this problem.

Okay, so I see a 5 and a 3, and I know I have to add them together. But then I see this weird thing that looks like a multiplication sign. I'm not sure what it means, but I think it means we have to multiply the 3 and the 2 together. So, 3 x 2 = 6.

Now, I add the 5 and the 6 together, and I get 11.

The answer is 11."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Hey, I'm just a grade 6 student, and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about. But I'll do my best to solve this problem!

So, when I see 5 + 2*4, I think, ""Okay, I know what a multiplication sign looks like, and I know what a plus sign looks like. I'll just follow the signs and see where they take me!""

So, I start with the multiplication sign. I see 2*4, and I know that means I have to multiply 2 and 4 together. That's easy! 2 times 4 is 8.

Now, I have 5 + 8. I know that 5 and 8 are both numbers, and I can add them together. So, I do that, and I get 13.

So, the answer is 13!

The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, we've got this math problem here that looks like this: 7*2 + 8*5. Now, I know we're supposed to follow some rules called PEMDAS, but I don't really know what that means. So, I'm just gonna do what makes sense to me.

First, I think we should multiply the 7 and 2 together, 'cause that's what the multiplication symbol means, right? So, that gives us 14.

Next, we've got the 8 and 5, so we'll multiply those together too. That gives us 40.

Now, we need to add 14 and 40 together. That's easy, it's 54!

The answer is 54.

I hope that's right! Can someone tell me if I did it correctly?"

I know I need to follow some rules, but I don't know what they are. I think I'm supposed to do something called ""PEMDAS,"" but I don't know what that means. Can you help me out?

Okay, so the problem is 4*3 + 2. I'm not sure where to start. I think I should multiply 4 and 3 first, so that's 12. Then, I need to add 2 to that, so that's 14. Is that right?

The answer is 14.

I hope that's correct! I'm really not sure if I did it right, but I tried my best. Can you tell me if I did it correctly?"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Hi there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

First, I see that there are lots of numbers and symbols here, so I'll try to break it down step by step.

* 4 times 2 plus 5 is equal to 4 times 7, which is 28.
* Then, there's a plus sign followed by 12. So, I'll add 12 to 28, which gives me 40.
* Next, there's a minus sign followed by 2 times 3. I'm not sure what that means, but I think it means to subtract 2 times 3 from 40.
* So, I'll subtract 6 from 40, which gives me 34.

The answer is 34!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm told to solve this math problem, 5 + 3*2. Now, I don't know much about this PEMDAS thingy, but I'll try my best.

Okay, so I see a 5 and a 3, and I know I have to add them together. But then I see this weird symbol, *, and I'm not sure what to do with it. I think it means I have to multiply the 3 and the 2 together. So, I do that and get 6.

Now, I have 5 + 6, which is 11. But wait, I'm not sure if that's right. Let me think... Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's correct!

The answer is 11."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, I know that when we add numbers, we have to do it from left to right. So, first, I'll add 5 and 2, and that's 7.

Then, I see that there's a multiplication sign, and I know that multiplication comes before addition. So, I'll multiply 4 by 2, and that's 8.

But wait, there's more addition! I have to add 7 and 8, and that's 15.

The answer is 15."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, so we have two multiplication problems: 7*2 and 8*5.

I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I'll do the multiplications first.

7*2 = 14
8*5 = 40

Now, I add 14 and 40:

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...

Okay, so we have four groups of three things, and that's like, 12 things total, right?

And then we have 2 more things.

So, if we add 12 and 2, we get... 14!

Okay, I think I know what to do! We need to follow the order of operations!

First, we need to do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7

Next, we multiply 4 by 7: 4*7 = 28

Then, we add 12: 28 + 12 = 40

Finally, we subtract 2 times 3: 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt3,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this problem...

Okay, I know that + comes before *, so I'll do the addition first. 5 + 3 is 8.

Now, I have 8 * 2, which is 16.

So, the answer is 16.

The answer is 16."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication before the addition, but I don't know why. Can someone please tell me why?

Oh, I see! It's because when you multiply a number by another number, it's like adding that number a certain number of times. For example, 2 times 4 is like adding 2 + 2 + 2 + 2, which is equal to 8.

So, in this problem, we need to multiply 2 by 4 first, which gives us 8. Then, we add 5 to 8, which gives us 13.

The answer is 13."
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Okay, so we have two numbers, 7 and 2, and we need to multiply them together. That's easy! 7 x 2 = 14.

But wait, there's more! We have another number, 8, and we need to multiply it by 5. That's easy too! 8 x 5 = 40.

Now, we need to add the two numbers together. 14 + 40 = 54.

Oh, I know! I can start by multiplying 4 and 3 because that's what we do when we see numbers next to each other. So, 4*3 is 12.

Next, I see a plus sign, so I know I need to add something. There's a 2 right after the plus sign, so I'll add 2 to 12. That gives me... hmm, let me count on my fingers... 12 + 2 is 14!

The answer is 14!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Hey there! I'm just a kid in elementary school, and I'm not sure what this ""order of operations"" thing is all about. But I'll do my best to solve this math problem.

First, I see some numbers and symbols that look like they need to be added or multiplied. I'm not sure what order to do them in, but I'll try to do what makes sense.

I'll start by multiplying 4 and 2 + 5. That gives me 4 x 7 = 28.

Next, I see a plus sign, so I'll add 12 to 28. That gives me 40.

Finally, I see a minus sign, so I'll subtract 2 times 3 from 40. That gives me 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34!"
llama-2-70b-chat,1,500,systemPrompt4,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication before the addition, but I don't know why. Can someone explain it to me like I'm five?

Okay, sure! Imagine you have five apples and you want to add three more apples to them. But then, your friend comes along and says, ""Hey, I have two apples that I want to give to you too!""

So, if you want to add the three apples your friend gave you to the five apples you already have, you need to do that before you add the two apples your friend gave you. That way, you'll have three apples plus two apples, which is five apples!

Now, let's write it down like a math problem: 5 + 3*2. The * means multiplication, so we do that first. 3*2 is six, so we write that down: 5 + 6. Now we add them together: 11!

The answer is 11."
