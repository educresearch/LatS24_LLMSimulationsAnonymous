Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5, which equals 7.<br>2. Now we have 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br>3. Next, we do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28, and 2 * 3 = 6.<br>4.

I'd do this problem by doing the multiplication first, and then the addition. So, I'd calculate 4 times 3, which equals 12. Then I'd add 2 to the result, so the final answer would be 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

But I'll do my best to figure out this problem!<br><br>First, I see that there's multiplication, so I'll do that part first. Then I see that there are two operations to do: multiplication and addition. I'll do the multiplication first because numbers get multiplied "quickly." So, I'll multiply 4 and 3: 4 &times; 3 = 12.<br><br>Now, there's only one operation left – addition. I'll add 12 and 2.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure about this one since I don't know about the rules for doing math in a certain order yet, but I think I should do the multiplication before adding because I saw the multiplication sign (*) before the addition sign (+).

Hmmm, let's try to make sense of it without any specific rules.<br><br>I suppose I should do the multiplication first, according to what looks like a logical sequence... right? So, I'll do the 2 * 4. That gives me 8. Then I'll take the result and add it to the 5. So, my calculation looks like this:<br><br>5 + 2 * 4<br>= 5 + 8<br>= 13<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I don't know much about math yet, but I think we have to do the multiplication before addition because the numbers are written next to each other in the multiplication problem. So let's do that first: 2 times 4 equals 8. Now we have 5 plus 8. That's easy, 5 plus 8 is 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let's see. I don't know anything about order of operations yet, but I think we should do the multiplication first, because we usually do multiplication before addition, right? So, 2 times 4 is 8. Then, add 5 to that. So, 5 plus 8 is 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure what this "order of operations" thing is, but my teacher said we have to follow certain rules when doing math. This problem has an addition and a multiplication, so let's see what my teacher meant.<br><br>I think we should do the multiplication first because I remember my teacher mentioning something about "multiplication and division before addition and subtraction." So, let's do the multiplication: 3 times 2 equals 6.<br><br>Now we have 5 plus 6, which is 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm a 6th grader and we haven't learned about order of operations yet. But I can tell you that to get the answer for this sum, we should do the multiplication before addition. So, I'll find the product of 3 and 2 first: 3 * 2 = 6.

      <td>GPT Response: As a young student, I don't know about order of operations yet. But I've heard that sometimes we need to do certain math steps in a specific order. Let's see if that applies here. This problem has an addition sign and a multiplication sign. Hmm, I'm not sure which one to do first. Maybe I should try multiplication before addition, because the multiplication symbol looks like it might take priority. So, I'll do the multiplication first:<br><br>3 * 2 = 6<br><br>Then, I'll do the addition:<br><br>5 + 6 = 11<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a beginner student, I would follow the order I see the operators in the equation. So, I will do the addition first, and then the multiplication. Created a simple acronym to help me "PEMDAS" (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction).<br><br>Since we don't have parentheses in this problem, let's follow the next step, which is multiplication and division. But we have only multiplication here.<br><br>First, let's perform the multiplication: 3*2 = 6<br>Now comes the addition part: 5 + 6<br><br>So, the solution in simple words is: Do the multiplication first, then the addition. Using my learned acronym PEMDAS as a guide to ensure I'm doing it correctly.<br><br>The answer is: 5 + 6 = 11. However I feel that the answer might be wrong since 5+3 should be done before doing *2, but that's what I know for now about Mathematics. I'll learn more as I grow up! :-) So, double-check with your teacher to make sure that my answer is correct!<br><br>Happy learning! <3</td>

I think the addition goes before the multiplication that I did just now, but since I don't know the rules exactly, I'll be careful. So, I'll add 14 and 40, giving me 54.<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
