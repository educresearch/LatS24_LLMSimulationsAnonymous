So, I would add 5 and 2 to get 7, then multiply that result by 4.

Doing this, I get 7 * 4, which equals 28.

The answer is 28."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I would first multiply 7 and 2 to get 14. Then, I would multiply 8 and 5 to get 40.

So I would first multiply 4 and 3, which equals 12. Then I would add 2 to 12, which equals 14.

The answer is 14."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: I would start by remembering that in this kind of problem, we have to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This helps to make sure that we solve the problem correctly.

First, I would solve the operation inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5. The result is 7.

Next, I would do multiplication, so I would multiply 4 by 7, which gives me 28.

Then, I would do the next multiplication, which is 2 times 3, giving me 6.

After that, I would do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So I would subtract 6 from 28 + 12, which gives me 40 + 12.

Finally, I would do the addition, which results in 52.

The answer is 52."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: As a sixth-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think about adding 5 and 3 to get 8. Then, I would multiply that result by 2. Doing this, I get 16. So,

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Well, I'm in grade 6 and I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), but I know that if we just follow the problem from left to right, it's pretty straightforward. 

First, we'd add 5 and 2 which gives us 7. Then, we multiply that result by 4. So, 7 times 4 equals 28.

The answer is 28."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Well, as a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the multiplication and addition from left to right. 

So, I would first multiply 7 by 2, which gives me 14. Then, I would multiply 8 by 5, which gives me 40.

mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first think of doing the addition and then the multiplication. That's because I learned that you should do the operations from left to right.

So, I would first calculate 5 + 3 to get 8.
Then, I would do the multiplication of 3*2 to get 6.
Finally, I would add the results of the addition and multiplication together to get 14.

The answer is 14."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: I don't know about any order of operations or PEMDAS, but I know that I can do addition and multiplication without being told a special order. I also know that multiplication is like adding the same number multiple times.

If I see 5 + 2*4, I might think ""I can do 2*4 first, because that's just like adding 2 to itself 4 times."" Then I would get 8.

After that, I could add the 5, which would give me 13.

The answer is 13."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: I don't know about any special rules for doing math, so I will just do the operations in the order they are given. First, I will do 7 times 2, which equals 14. Then, I will do 8 times 5, which equals 40. Next, I will add those two results together. So, 14 plus 40 equals 54.

The answer is 54."

I would start by doing the operations that are inside the parentheses. That's what I would do even if I didn't know about PEMDAS.

First, I would add 2 + 5 to get 7.
Then, I would multiply 4 by 7 to get 28.
Next, I would multiply 2 by 3 to get 6.
After that, I would subtract 6 from 28 to get 22.
Lastly, I would add 12 to 22 to get 34.

The answer is 34."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: I don't know a lot about math, but I know that in this question, we need to do the multiplication first because it comes before addition in the order of operations. So I would multiply 3 and 2 to get 6. Then I would add the 5 to get 11. So the answer is 11.

The answer is 11."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: As a curious elementary school student who has just learned to do basic arithmetic, I don't know about any order of operations yet. I would simply solve this from left to right.

First, I would add 5 and 2 to get 7.
Then, I would multiply that 7 by 4.

So, 5 + 2*4 = 7 + 8 = 15.

The answer is 15."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Well, I don't know much about this order of operations thing, but I remember my teacher saying something about doing multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. So, for this problem, 7*2 + 8*5, I should do the multiplication parts first. 

First, let's do 7 times 2. That equals 14.
Then, let's do 8 times 5. That equals 40.

Now, add those two results together: 14 + 40.
The answer is 54.

So, The answer is 54."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about order of operations, I would first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then, I would add 2 to 12. So, 4*3 + 2 equals 12 + 2 which is 14.

The answer is 14."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this, I would first do the operations in the parentheses. That's the numbers inside the (). So, I would add 2 and 5 to get 7. 

Then, I would multiply 4 by 7 because it's next in the order of operations (outside parentheses, we do multiplication and division first, before addition and subtraction). So, I would get 28.

Next, I would subtract 2 (from the original expression) because now I need to do addition and subtraction. But wait! I also have another multiplication: 2 times 3, which is 6. So, I subtract 6 from 28 instead of 2. That gives me 22.

Finally, I would add 12 to 22, which gives me 34.

The answer is 34."
mixtral-8x7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I will just follow the way the question is written and do the operations from left to right. 

First, I will add 5 and 3, which gives me 8. Then, I will multiply that result by 2. So, 8 times 2 equals 16.

The answer is 16."
