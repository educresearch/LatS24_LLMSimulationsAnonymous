      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! So, I'm not really sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll give it a try.<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4, and it looks like it's multiplying something. There's some stuff inside the parentheses, so I'll do that first.<br><br>Inside the parentheses, there's a 2 and a 5. I think I'm supposed to add those together, so that's 7.<br><br>Now, there's this thing that says "plus 12". I think that means I add 12 to the 7 I just got. So, that's 19.<br><br>But wait, there's more! There's a 2 and a 3, and it looks like I'm supposed to multiply them. That's 6.<br><br>Now, there's a minus sign, and it looks like I'm supposed to subtract 6 from 19. That gives me 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.<br><br>I hope that's right! Can someone tell me if I did it correctly?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thingy is all about.

      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, I'm not sure how to do this problem. I know I need to follow some rules, but I don't know what they are. I think I need to do the multiplication first, so I'll start by multiplying 4 by 2+5. That gives me 4 * 7 = 28.<br><br>Next, I need to add 12 to 28, so I get 40.<br><br>Finally, I need to subtract 2 times 3 from 40. That's 2 * 3 = 6, so I subtract 6 from 40 and get 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I don't know what the order of operations is, but I can try to solve the problem step by step.<br><br>First, I see a multiplication sign, so I will multiply 4 and 2+5.<br>2+5 is 7, so I will multiply 4 and 7.<br>4 * 7 = 28<br><br>Next, I see a plus sign, so I will add 12 to 28.<br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>Finally, I see a minus sign, so I will subtract 2 times 3 from 40.<br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

I know that 5 is a bigger number than 2, so let's start by adding 5 and 2. That gives us 7.<br><br>Now, we have 7 * 4. I'm not sure what the * symbol means, but I think it means we have to multiply 7 and 4. So, 7 x 4 = 28.<br><br>So, the answer is 28!<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...<br><br>Okay, I know that when you have addition and multiplication in a problem, you have to do the multiplication first.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure how to do this problem, but I think I know what the order of operations means. It's like a recipe for solving math problems. So, I think I should follow these steps:<br><br>1. First, I should do the multiplication, because it's inside the parentheses. That's what the "P" in PEMDAS stands for, right? So, 3 * 2 = 6.<br>2. Next, I should do the addition. That's what the "A" in PEMDAS stands for. So, 5 + 6 = 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Sure, I'll give it a try!<br><br>So, we have 5 + 3 * 2. I know that when we multiply, we do it before we add. That's just how we do things in grade 6!

So, I'll multiply 2 by 3, and that gives me 6.<br><br>Now, I have 8 and 6, and I need to add them together. So, 8 + 6 = 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

I know we have to follow some rules when we do math, but I don't know what they are called. Oh wait, I remember! My teacher said something about doing things in a special order. Let's see... we have to do the things inside the parentheses first, then the exponents, then the multiplication and division, and finally the addition and subtraction. Wow, that's a lot to remember!<br><br>Okay, so let's start with the inside stuff. We have a 7 and a 2, and we have to multiply them together. That's easy! 7 x 2 = 14. Now we have to add 8 and 5. That's easy too! 8 + 5 = 13. Oh, wait! I think we're supposed to do the multiplication before the addition. Oops! Okay, let's try again.<br><br>We have 7 * 2 = 14, and then we have 8 * 5 = 40. Whoa, that's a big number! Now we have to add 14 and 40. Hmmm... that's a little tricky, but I think we can do it. 14 + 40 = 54!<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! So, we have a big multiplication problem. Let's start by multiplying the first two numbers together. 7 * 2 = 14. Now, we have to multiply 8 by 5, which is 40. Finally, we add 14 and 40 which gives us... 54! The answer is 54.</td>
