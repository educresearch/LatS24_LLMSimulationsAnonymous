mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Well, I'm a grade 6 student and I've never heard about those letters, PEMDAS or anything like that in math. But I've been told that when we have an expression with multiple operations, we need to follow some rules to find the answer correctly. This is what I understand:

We should do the multiplication before adding since you know, ""times"" comes before ""plus"" in English, right? So, first, I'll do the multiplication part: 

2 * 4 = 8

Then, I'll add the numbers:

5 + 8 = 13

The answer is: The answer is 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure about this, but I think we need to do the multiplication first and then the addition. So, we do:

1. 8 * 5 = 40
2. Then, we do 7 * 2 = 14
3. Finally, we add the results: 14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm not familiar with the order of operations rule (PEMDAS). But let's try to make sense of this expression step by step.

The expression given is ""4 * 3 + 2"". I see two operations here: multiplication and addition. Usually, we do the multiplication first and then the addition. But I'm not sure if this is a rule or just a common practice, so let's finish the multiplication part first:

4 * 3 = 12

Now, we're left with the addition part:

12 + 2 = 14

So, The answer is __.
14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I don't know about the order of operations yet, so I'll just solve this step by step, following the way the numbers and symbols are arranged:

1. First, I'll do the operation inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7
2. Then I'll do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28, 2 * 3 = 6
3. After that, I'll subtract: 28 - 6 = 22
4. Finally, I'll add: 22 + 12 = 34

The answer is: The answer is 34."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I have not learnt about order of operations yet. But I can try to solve this problem by doing the multiplication first and then adding the results. So, let's do 3 * 2 which is 6, and then add 5 to get the final answer.

The answer is: 5 + 6 = 11."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I've learned some basic mathematcal operations like addition and multiplication. However, I didn't learn about the order of operations yet, so I'll try to solve this problem by doing what seems logical to me. But remember, my solution might not be the correct one according to the rules of PEMDAS.

Since the multiplication symbol (*) appears before the addition symbol (+), I think I should do the multiplication first, because I've been taught that multiplication comes before addition. So, I'll calculate 2 * 4, which equals 8.

Then, I have 5 + 8. I know that when I add numbers together, I start with the first number and add the second number to it. So, I'll add 5 and 8, which equals 13.

So, here's what I think the solution is:

Step 1: 2 * 4 = 8
Step 2: 5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Well, I'm just a 6th grader, so we haven't learned the special rules for this kind of thing yet. But let's try to make sense of it. I'd do one operation at a time, starting with the ones inside the parentheses, if there were any. Since there aren't any in this problem, I guess I'll do multiplication before addition, like my teacher taught me. So, I'd do 7 times 2 first, then 8 times 5. That gives me:

14 (7 * 2)
32 (8 * 5)

Now, I guess I should add those results together, since there's a ""plus"" sign between themâ€¦ Let's see:

14 + 32

Ah, I see! That gives me an answer of 46!

The answer is 46."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: As a 6th grade student, I haven't learned about the order of operations yet. So, I'll do this calculation step by step as I think it should be done:

First, I'll do the multiplication: 4 * 3 = 12

The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: As a 6th grade student, I've yet to learn about the order of operations in mathematics. I'll simply follow the usual rule of performing the calculating the operations inside the parentheses first, then do the multiplication and division from left to right, and finally add and subtract from left to right.

Let's try to solve the expression:

First, calculate the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7

Now, multiply: 4 * 7 = 28

Then, subtract 2 * 3 both sides: 28 - 2 * 3

First, do the multiplication: 2 * 3 = 6

Subtract 6 from 28: 28 - 6 = 22

Finally, add 12: 22 + 12 = 34

The answer is 34."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt2,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm just a 6th grade student, and I haven't learned the rule about order of operations yet. But, I think it might be a good idea to follow this: The multiplication happens before the addition, right? So, let's do the multiplication first: 3 * 2 equals 6, then add the numbers: 5 + 6. So, the calculation would look like this:

First, 3 * 2 = 6
Next, 5 + 6

Therefore, the answer is 11. But remember, I haven't learned about order of operations properly, so double-check this solution with your teacher!

The answer is __.

__ = 11."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Well, I don't really know about order of operations in mathematics yet, but I can try to guess how to do this sum based on what I see. I think we should do the multiplication first because there are numbers and an asterisk (*) between them, which seems to mean ""multiply"" to me. So we have:

5 + 2 * 4

Now, let's do the multiplication:

5 + 2 * 4 = 5 + 8

Finally, we just need to do the addition:

5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations rule in mathematics, which is often represented by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction). However, I can still try to solve this problem by performing the multiplication before the addition, as I know that multiplication comes before addition.

So, I would first find the product of 7 and 2, which equals 14. Then, I would calculate the product of 8 and 5, which equals 40. Finally, I would add these two products together:

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Well, I don't really know what order of operations means. But, I see there are some numbers and symbols in this equation. I think I should do the multiplication first since there are two numbers being multiplied, and then add the result to the number next to it. So, I'll do 4 times 3 first, which equals 12. Then, I'll add 2 to 12. The answer is __.

The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't know about order of operations yet. So, I would do each operation as I see it from left to right, just like reading a sentence. Let's give it a try:

First, we have the parentheses: 
2 + 5 = 7

Now, we have multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28

Then, we have another multiplication:
2 * 3 = 6

Lastly, addition and subtraction:
28 + 12 = 40 (addition)
40 - 6 = 34 (subtraction)

So, according to my understanding without considering order of operations, the answer is 34. However, if we follow the correct order of operations (PEMDAS), the answer might be different. But, in this situation, as a young student, I wouldn't be able to apply that knowledge."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt3,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm just an elementary school student and I don't know about those letters you see in math problems like ""+"", ""*"", and so on. But I've noticed that whenever we do math problems, we don't do multiplication and division at the same time, and we don't do addition and subtraction at the same time. So, I think we should do the multiplication first, and then the addition.

So, let's do the multiplication: 3 * 2 equals 6.

Now, we have 5 plus 6. Let's do that: 5 + 6 equals 11.

The answer is 11."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Well, I don't know much about math yet, but my teacher says we should do the multiplication before addition. So, let's do that first. 2 times 4 is 8.Now, I add the number I had before, which is 5. So, 5 plus 8 gives me 13.

The answer is 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Well, I'm just a little student, and this looks like a complicated math problem to me. But let's try to solve it step by step!

First, I see some multiplication signs, so I think we should do those before addition, right? That's what my teacher tells me. So let's do 7 times 2 first:

7 * 2 = 14

Now we have 14 and an addition problem: 14 plus 8 times 5. Hmm, I'm not sure which one to do first. Let me think...

Oh, wait! My teacher always reminds us to do the multiplication before the addition, so I'll do the second multiplication first:

8 * 5 = 40

Now we have 14 and 40. And then, what's left? Adding those two numbers together, I think:

14 + 40 = 54

So, the answer is...

The answer is 54."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Well, I see some numbers and some symbols here, but I don't know which one to do first since I haven't learned about order of operations yet. So, let me just try doing the multiplication first and then the addition. That means I'll calculate 4 * 3 first, and then add 2 to the result. Let's see, 4 multiplied by 3 is 12. Now, I add 2 to 12. That gives me 14.

The answer is 14."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Well, I'm just a little elementary school student and I haven't learned about the order of operations yet. But let's try to solve this problem step by step in a simple way.

First, let's do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7. So now we have 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, I see numbers that are multiplied, so let's do that: 4 * 7 = 28, and 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, we have 28 + 12 - 6.

Then, I see addition again, so let's do that: 28 + 12 = 40.

Finally, we have 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,500,systemPrompt4,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: As a young student, I don't know about order of operations yet. I'll try to solve the problem by doing the multiplication first, then the addition:

First, I'll do 3 * 2 = 6. Then I'll do the addition: 5 + 6.

So, my solution process would be:
3 * 2 = 6
5 + 6 = 11

The answer is: 11."
