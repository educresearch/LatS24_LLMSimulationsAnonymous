      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not familiar with something called "PEMDAS" or the "order of operations" in mathematics yet. But, I can try to solve this problem by focusing on the symbols inside the parentheses first, and then tackling the multiplication and addition from left to right, followed by the subtraction.<br><br>Let's follow these steps:<br><br>1. Solve the expression inside the parentheses: (2+5) = 7<br>2. Multiply 4 with 7: 4 * 7 = 28<br>3. Next, we have 12 - 2 * 3. Since we need to follow the subtraction after multiplication, we should solve the multiplication first: 2 * 3 = 6. Now, subtract this product from 12: 12 - 6 = 6.<br><br>The answer is 28 + 6.<br><br>So, the final answer based on my limited understanding would be 34. However, it is important to note that without knowing about the order of operations, this method might not always give the correct answer. Therefore, it is important to learn the rules of order of operations to ensure accurate calculations.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations in Mathematics. But let me try to solve the problem step by step, based on what I think makes sense.<br><br>First, let's do the operation inside the parentheses:<br><br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now, we have:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I'll do the multiplication because I see them first:<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>Now, the equation looks like this:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Next, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right:<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So, the answer is:<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a elementary school student, I'm not familiar with the order of operations in mathematics yet. I would approach the problem by doing the operations inside the parentheses first. That means adding 2 and 5, which gives me 7. Then, I would multiply 4 by 7, which gives me 28. After that, I would add 12, so the problem looks like this: 28 + 12. The final step would be to add those numbers, which results in a sum of 40. Regarding the subtraction of 2 * 3, I would leave it until the end since it's not inside parentheses, but in this case, it doesn't affect the final answer.<br><br>The answer is: 40.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I know that in mathematics, we have numbers, and we do some special things called operations. I see here we have some numbers and some operations. The operations are multiplication, addition, and subtraction. I also see some parentheses. Let's take a look at them step by step, following the order I see:<br><br>1. First, the parentheses: I'll open them up and do what's inside first. It says 2 + 5, so that's addition.<br>2. So, now I have 4 * (7) and 12 - 2 * 3.<br>3. Next, I do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6.<br>4. Now I have 28 and 12 - 6.<br>5. Subtract first: 12 - 6 = 6.<br>6. Then, I have 28 + 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I know that in Mathematics, we sometimes have to follow a specific rule to solve an equation with multiple operations. I have heard the teachers mention something called PEMDAS, but I am not exactly sure what each letter stands for. Let me try to solve this problem, 5+2 * 4, based on what I think might be the right order.<br><br>First, I'll do the multiplication since it looks like it comes before the addition in the given expression. So, 2 * 4 equals 8. Now, the expression becomes 5 + 8.<br><br>Next, I'll do the addition. So, 5 + 8 equals 13.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is...<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I've learned how to do addition and multiplication, but I'm not sure about the order in which to do them. Let's try to figure this out together.<br><br>First, let's do the multiplication because, to me, that seems like it should come before addition in some way, but I'm not really sure. So, 2 * 4 equals 8. Now, I have 5, and I need to add 8. I've heard this concept being referred to as "order of operations," but I'm not quite sure what that means yet.<br><br>Let's see if this works: Instead of doing the multiplication first, what if I did the addition first? If I add 5 and 2 (the numbers outside the multiplication symbol), I get 7. And then, I can add 4 to that result. So, 7 + 4 equals 11.<br><br>I'm not sure which answer is correct, but one of them must be. Let's see if we can figure it out by comparing these results to the answers we get when we follow the typical "order of operations" guidelines (PEMDAS).<br><br>The answer is .... let me double-check if 8 = 11 by checking with my teacher or a more experienced mathematician. If that's not correct, then the answer following the order of operations (PEMDAS) should be 5 + (2 * 4) = 5 + 8 = 13.<br><br>The answer is 13. I see that, following the order of operations (PEMDAS), I should have done the multiplication before the addition. The correct order is (2 * 4) + 5 = 13. It's important to remember these rules to make sure all calculations are accurate.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just a kid and I don't know what "order of operations" means. But I can try to do this math problem. I'll start with the multiplication since there are numbers and a symbol (*) in it. So, that's 2 * 4. That makes 8. Now, I have 5 + 8 left. So, I do addition this time. Five and eight make thirteen. That's all I know how to do. The answer is: <br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a fifth-grade student, I've learned how to do simple addition and multiplication. In this problem, I see an addition and a multiplication sign, which seems a bit confusing. But let's try to tackle it by following the rules I've learned.<br><br>First, I'll focus on the multiplication part (2 * 4) since I've learned to do that before addition. When I multiply, I count how many groups of the first number (2) that I can fit into the second number (4), and then I count how many groups of the second number I can fit in the first number: 2 * 4 = 8.<br><br>Now, I look at the addition (5 + 8). This one is straightforward. I've learned that to find the sum of two numbers, I align them on top of each other, making sure the numbers with the same place value line up. So, 5 + 8:<br><br>  5<br>+ _____<br> 8<br><br>I add the tens digits: 5 + 8 = 13<br>And then, the ones digits: 0 + 3 = 3<br><br>So, the sum is 13. Finally, since I have no carry from adding the tens digits, the final answer for the problem is:<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
