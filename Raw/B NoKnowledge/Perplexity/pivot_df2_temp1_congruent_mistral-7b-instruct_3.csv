mistral-7b-instruct,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: I'm not sure what the numbers and symbols mean in this equation. I know that sometimes we need to follow certain rules when solving mathematical expressions, but I haven't learned about those rules yet. So, I'll try to do the calculation step by step, but I might not be doing it correctly according to the rules.

First, let's do any calculations inside parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

Now, I see some multiplication signs. Let's do those next, but which one first? I don't know the rules for that yet, so I'll just pick one and hope for the best:

4 * 7 = 28

Now, I see another multiplication sign and some subtraction:
28 * 3 = 84
12 - 2 = 10

So, I'll do the subtraction next:
84 - 10 = 74

The answer is 74.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I don't know about order of operations (PEMDAS) yet. I'll just do the calculation step by step, following the order that makes sense to me.

First, I'll do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7

Next, I'll multiply: 4 * 7 = 28

Then, I'll do the other multiplication: 2 * 3 = 6

Finally, I'll do the subtraction: 28 + 12 - 6

Combining the adding and subtracting from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40, 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: I'm just an elementary school student, and I don't really know about those letters in math (PEMDAS). But I can tell you how I would do this problem step by step, the way it makes sense to me:

1. Solve the parentheses: add 2 and 5, which makes 7.
2. Multiply the numbers outside the first set of parentheses: 4 times 7, which makes 28.
3. Subtract the second set of numbers: 12 minus 2, which makes 10.
4. Finally, add the result from step 2 to the result from step 3: 28 plus 10, which makes 38.

The answer is: 38.","GPT Response: I don't know about order of operations yet. But let's try to do this addiction and subtraction problem step by step:

First, I'll do the numbers inside parentheses (2 + 5), which gives me 7.

Now, I have 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. Let's do the multiplication: 

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

So, now it becomes 28 + 12 - 6.

Next, I'll add 12 and 28, which is 40.

Then, I'll subtract 6 from 40: 

40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what those funny letters mean in this equation, but my teacher said something about certain operations having to be done first. Let's see, there's multiplication and addition here. Normally, I'd do multiplication before addition because I've heard that's the rule, but I don't know why or what it's called. So, let's do the multiplication first:

4 * 3 = 12

Now, there's just addition left:

12 + 2 = 14

So, the answer is:

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Well, I've got this math problem here, and it says I should do 4 times 3 first, but then there's a plus sign after that! That means we add something, right? So, let's do 4 times 3, which is 12. Now, I've got 12, and 2. Hmm, I'm not quite sure what to do now. Maybe I should do the 2 first because it's a smaller number? But then, what about the 12? I think maybe I made a mistake. Let me try it another way. I'll do the multiplication first, then the addition. That makes more sense, right? So, I'll do 4 times 3, getting 12, and then add 2. That gives me an answer of 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS is or what order I'm supposed to do the operations in. I guess I could try doing the multiplication first and then the addition, but I'm not completely sure that's the right thing to do. So here's what I'll do:

First, I'll do the multiplication: 4 * 3 = 12

Next, I'll do the addition: 12 + 2 = 14

So, The answer is 14.","GPT Response: I see numbers and some symbols on this paper. I think they mean I should do the multiplication first and then add. So, I'll do 4 times 3, which equals 12. Now, I have 12 and 2. I guess I should add those numbers together. So, I'll put a 1 in front of 2 because when I add 1 to a number, it becomes 1 more than that number. Then I'll put the 2 next to the 1. So, 1 + 2 equals 3.

Therefore, the answer is 15. (Note: According to standard order of operations or PEMDAS rule, the sum should be calculated after the multiplication, resulting in the final answer being 12 + 2 = 14. However, since I, as an elementary school student, am unaware of the order of operations rule, my response will be 15.)"
mistral-7b-instruct,1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I have not learned about order of operations yet. So, I would approach this problem by doing the multiplication first, then adding the numbers.

Here's my thought process:

1. I see the multiplication sign (x), so I do that first.
2. The multiplication is 2 times 4, which equals 8.
3. Now, I have 5 (the number before the addition) and 8 (the result of the multiplication).
4. So, I add these two numbers together, following the basic addition rule.
5. The answer is 13.

The answer is __13__.","GPT Response: Well, I'm just a sixth grader and we haven't learned about this thing called PEMDAS or order of operations yet. But, I see there are addition and multiplication signs in this equation. Let me try to figure it out with what I know.香Label: 先乘 Santiago: I think maybe I should do the multiplication first because the * sign is there.

So, 2 multiplied by 4 equals 8. ськіNow, I need to add that answer to the number that was originally on the left side of the equation.

5 + 8equals 13.

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure about this, but maybe we should do the multiplication first, and then the addition? That's what my teacher once told me when she taught us about adding numbers and multiplying numbers. So, I would do 2 multiplied by 4 which gives me 8. Then I add 5 to get the final answer.

The answer is 13 (actually, it should be 8+5=13, but since I don't know PEMDAS yet, I can only give you the final answer).","GPT Response: Hmm, this looks like a math problem to me! But I'm just a little student and I don't know anything about the special rules for solving math problems yet, like what order to do the operations in. Let me give it a try and see if I can figure it out step by step:

First, I see that there's an addition sign (+) and a multiplication sign (*) in the problem. I'm not sure which one to do first, so I'll try doing the multiplication first because it looks like it's supposed to be done before the addition in English words (""five plus two times four"").

So, I'll do the multiplication: 2 times 4 equals 8.

Now, I have 5 plus 8. Let me try adding those numbers together: 5 + 8 equals 13.

So, the answer is: The answer is 13."
mistral-7b-instruct,1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I have not learned about order of operations in mathematics yet. But I can still try to solve this problem by following the rules that I have learned so far. I will do the multiplication first because I know that you usually do multiplication before addition. So, I will calculate 3*2, which equals 6. Then I will do the addition: 5 + 6. The answer is 11.

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: As a 6th grade student, I've learned how to do addition and multiplication, but I haven't learned the order of operations yet. When I see this equation, I'd usually do addition before multiplication because that's what feels natural to me. However, to find the correct answer, I need to follow the order of operations, which is a rule we follow to get the right answer, even if it might not be what comes first in our mind. According to this rule, multiplication should be done before addition. In this case, that means we first multiply 3 and 2 to get 6, and then we add 5 to that result:

5 + 3*2 = 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Well, I'm an elementary school student and I don't know about this thing called PEMDAS yet. But I can tell you this: we usually do multiplication before addition. So I'd do the 3 multiplied by 2 first: that's 6. Then I'd add 5 to that: so 5 + 6 equals 11. The answer is 11.","GPT Response: I'm just a happy little elementary school student, and I don't know much about complicated math rules yet. But I can tell you this: When you see an addition sign (+) and a multiplication sign (*) together, you need to follow the rule called ""PEMDAS"" which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). It helps to make sure the order of operations is correct. In our case, multiplication comes before addition. So, we should first do 3*2 which equals 6. Then, add 5 to that result. Therefore, The answer is 5 + 3*2 = 11. Yay, math! (but I'm still learning!)"
mistral-7b-instruct,1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I've never heard of PEMDAS or the order of operations in mathematics. So, I would approach this problem by doing the multiplication first, then addition. That's what I've learned so far:

1. Multiply 7 by 2: 7 × 2 = 14
2. Multiply 8 by 5: 8 × 5 = 40
3. Add the results: 14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: I'm a 6th grade student and I'm not familiar with the order of operations in math yet, but let's try to solve this problem step by step. It looks like we have two calculations, one with multiplication and one with addition. Usually, when we see addition and multiplication in the same expression, we follow the rule that multiplication comes before addition. So let's do the multiplication first:

1. 7 * 2 = 14
2. 8 * 5 = 40

Now that we have the results of the multiplication, we can proceed with the addition:

1. 14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.

But I think I can still try to solve this problem. I guess I should do the multiplication first, because in my head, I usually do multiplication before addition. So, let me do 7 times 2 and 8 times 5. That gives me:

14 (from 7*2)
40 (from 8*5)

Now, I'll add those numbers together:

54

So, The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Well, I know that I have to do the numbers inside the parentheses first if there are any, and then do any exponents. But in this problem, there are no parentheses or exponents. So, I think I should do the multiplication first, because that's what the order of operations rule says. But which one should I do first, the 7*2 or the 8*5? I don't know which one is easier to calculate first, so I'll just do one of them. I'll do 7*2. That gives me 14. Now, I have 14 and I need to add 8*5. Let's see, 8 times 5 is 40. So, I add 14 to 40. That gives me 54.

The answer is 54."
