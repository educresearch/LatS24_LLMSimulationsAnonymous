      <td>GPT Response: Okay, let's try to solve this problem together!<br><br>First, we have 4 times something, and that something is 2 plus 5. So, we need to add 2 and 5 first.<br><br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Great! Now, we have 4 times 7, which is...<br><br>4 x 7 = 28<br><br>Next, we have 12. That's easy, we just add 12 to 28.<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>Finally, we have 2 times something. That something is 3. So, we need to multiply 2 and 3.<br><br>2 x 3 = 6<br><br>Now, we need to subtract 6 from 40.<br><br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>The answer is 34!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. I think it's something about following a certain order when you do math problems, but I'm not sure what that order is. Can you help me?<br><br>Okay, let's see... 4 times 2 is 8, plus 5 is 13, plus 12 is 25, minus 2 times 3 is 25 - 6, which is 19.<br><br>The answer is 19.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey, I'm just a kid in elementary school, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem!<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is the big number 4. It looks like it wants to be multiplied by something. Let's see... oh, there's a parentheses! That means we gotta do what's inside the parentheses first.<br><br>Inside the parentheses, there's a 2 and a 5. We need to add those together. Hmm... 2 + 5 equals... (thinking) 7!<br><br>Now, we can multiply 4 by 7. That's easy! 4 x 7 = 28.<br><br>But wait, there's more! There's a plus sign and a 12. We need to add 12 to 28. That's easy too! 28 + 12 = 40.<br><br>Oh no, there's a minus sign and a 2! We need to subtract 2 from 40. That's okay, I can do that! 40 - 2 = 38.<br><br>Phew, that was a lot of work! But I did it! The answer is 38. ðŸ˜ƒ</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what the order of operations is. Can you tell me what the order of operations is?<br><br>Okay, I was told that the order of operations is:<br><br>1. Parentheses<br>2. Exponents (none in this problem)<br>3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)<br>4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)<br><br>So, let me try to solve it now:<br><br>4*(2+5) = 4*7 = 28<br>28 + 12 = 40<br>40 - 2*3 = 40 - 6 = 34<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do this thing called "order of operations" when solving math problems. I think it's like a secret code that helps us figure out what to do first.<br><br>So, let's see... the problem is 4*3+2. I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, so I'll do that. 4 times 3 is... umm... 12!<br><br>Now, I'm supposed to do the addition next. So, 12 + 2 is... 14!<br><br>The answer is 14.<br><br>I hope that's right! I'm still a little confused about this order of operations thing, but I'll get the hang of it eventually.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. Can you help me?<br><br>Okay, I think I know how to do it now. First, I think we should do the multiplication because it's at the beginning of the problem. So, 4 times 3 is 12.<br><br>Next, we have the addition part. We need to add 2 to 12, so 12 + 2 is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I think I can help you with that problem!<br><br>First, let's start with the multiplication part, which is 4 times 3. That's easy, it's 12!<br><br>Next, we have the addition part, which is 2. We add 2 to 12, and that gives us... 14!<br><br>So, the answer is 14!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do multiplication before addition, but I don't know why. Let's see... 4 times 3 is 12, and then we add 2, so that's 14. The answer is 14.</td>

I know I have to add the 5 and the 2 first because they're next to each other. That's 7. Then I have to multiply the 2 and the 4, that's 8. So, 7 + 8 is 15.<br><br>The answer is 15!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I don't know what PEMDAS means. I think it might be a way to do math problems, but I'm not sure. Can you help me?<br><br>Okay, let me try my best. I think I need to add 5 and 2 first, so that's 7. Then, I need to multiply 7 by 4, which is 28.<br><br>The answer is 28.<br><br>I hope that's right! I'm not sure if I did it correctly because I don't know much about math. Can you please help me learn more about PEMDAS?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so we have this problem: 5+2*4. I'm not sure what PEMDAS means, but I think it's important to follow some rules to get the right answer.<br><br>First, I'll add 5 and 2. That's easy! 5 + 2 = 7.<br><br>Next, I'll multiply 2 by 4. That's also easy! 2 x 4 = 8.<br><br>Now, I'm not sure what to do. I think I'm supposed to add 7 and 8, but I'm not sure if I should do that before or after I multiply 7 by 8. I'm confused!<br><br>Oh wait, I remember something my teacher said! She said that when we have multiplication and addition in a problem, we should do the multiplication first and then do the addition.<br><br>So, I'll multiply 7 by 8 first. That's a little harder, but I can do it! 7 x 8 = 56.<br><br>Now, I'll add 56 and 5. That's easy! 56 + 5 = 61.<br><br>The answer is 61!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! So, I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, but I don't know why. It just says to do it that way. So, I'll do the multiplication first.<br><br>2 times 4 is 8.<br><br>Now, I have 5 plus 8, which is 13.<br><br>The answer is 13!</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think...okay, I know I have to follow some rules to solve this problem. I think it's something like "PEMDAS"...ugh, what does that even stand for? Oh well, I think it means I have to do the multiplication first, then the addition. So, I'll start by multiplying 3 and 2, which gives me 6. Then, I add 5 and 6, which gives me 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to do the multiplication first, but I don't know why. It just seems like the right thing to do. So, I'll do the multiplication and get 6. Then, I'll add 5 and 6, which gives me 11. The answer is 11.<br><br>But wait, my teacher said something about parentheses being important. I think that means I should do the multiplication inside the parentheses first. So, I'll do 3*2 inside the parentheses and get 6. Then, I'll add 5 and 6, which gives me 11. The answer is still 11.<br><br>I hope that's right! I'm not really sure what I'm doing, but it seems to work. Can someone please explain to me why we do the multiplication first?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I see this Math question, and I'm like, "Wait, what's PEMDAS again?" And my teacher's like, "It's the order of operations, duh!" And I'm like, "Oh yeah, I remember now!"<br><br>So, I look at the problem, and I see that there's a bunch of stuff happening. There's a 5, a 3, and a 2, and they're all doing different things. Like, the 5 is just chillin' there, not doing much. The 3 is multiplying the 2, which is cool, I guess. But, like, what do I do first?<br><br>I'm like, "Okay, let me think about this." And I start by doing the multiplication first. So, 3 times 2 is 6, because, you know, 3 groups of 2 is 6. That's easy!<br><br>Then, I'm like, "Okay, what's next?" And I see that there's this 5 just sitting there, looking at me. And I'm like, "Oh, I know! I add the 5 to the 6!" So, 6 + 5 is 11.<br><br>And that's it! The answer is 11.<br><br>I mean, it's not that hard, right? I just did what made sense. I did the multiplication first, and then I added the 5. It's like, basic Math, you know? But, like, I guess it's important to know the order of operations and stuff. Maybe next time I'll remember to do it in the right order. Maybe.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
