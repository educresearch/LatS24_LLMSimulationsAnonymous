      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this "PEMDAS" thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>Okay, so the first thing I see is the 4 multiplication sign, so I'll start by multiplying 4 and 2+5. That gives me 4*7 = 28.<br><br>Next, I see the 12 addition sign, so I'll add 28 and 12, which gives me 40.<br><br>After that, I see the 2 multiplication sign, so I'll multiply 2 and 3, which gives me 6.<br><br>Finally, I see the minus sign, so I'll subtract 6 from 40, which gives me 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.<br><br>I hope that's correct! Can you help me learn more about this PEMDAS thing?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hey there! I'm a grade 6 student and I'm not sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I'll do my best to solve this math problem.<br><br>Okay, so I see a bunch of numbers and symbols here. Let's start with the multiplication. I know that 4 times 2 is 8, and 4 times 5 is 20. So, 4*(2+5) is 8 + 20 = 28.<br><br>Next, I see a plus sign and a minus sign. I'm not sure what order I'm supposed to do these in, but I'll just do them from left to right. So, 28 + 12 = 40.<br><br>Finally, there's a minus sign and a 3. I know that 3 times 2 is 6, so 2*3 is 6. But then I have to subtract 6 from 40, which gives me 34.<br><br>So, the answer is 34!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm not supposed to know anything about order of operations, but my teacher always says " Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction" <br>                                                                                                                                                       when she writes it, it looks like PEMDAS   <br><br>Okay, so in the problem 4*(2+5)+12-2*3     <br>I think we should do the addition inside the parentheses first, that's what my teacher always says     <br>So the first thing that we need to do is 2+5 = 7 <br>                                                       <br>Next, we multiply 4 by 7 = 28 <br>                                                      <br>Then, we add 12 = 40 <br>                                                     <br>Next, we minus 2 times 3 = 6 <br>                                                    <br>So the final answer is 40 - 6 = 34. <br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, I'll give it a try!<br><br>First, I see some parentheses, so I need to do what's inside them first. That's 2+5, which is 7.<br><br>Next, I see a multiplication sign, so I'll do that next. 4 times 7 is 28.<br><br>After that, I see another multiplication sign, so I'll do that next. 2 times 3 is 6.<br><br>Finally, I see a subtraction sign, so I'll do that last. 28 minus 6 is 22.<br><br>The answer is 22.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to follow this thing called PEMDAS, but I don't really know what that means. I think it's like a robot that helps us do math or something? Anyway, my teacher said to follow some steps when we do math, so I'll try my best!<br><br>First, I see a 5. That's easy, I know what that means! It means we have 5 things. Like, if I had 5 pencils, that would be cool.<br><br>Next, I see a 2. That's not too hard either! That means we have 2 groups of things. Like, if I had 2 groups of 5 pencils, that would be 10 pencils!<br><br>Oh, wait, there's more! There's a * symbol. That means we have to multiply, right? So, 2 groups of 5 pencils means we have 10 pencils. But wait, there's a 4 here too! That means we have to multiply 2 groups of 5 pencils by 4! That's like... 20 pencils?!<br><br>But wait, there's one more thing! There's a + sign! That means we have to add something. So, we have 20 pencils, and we have to add 5 more pencils. That's like... 25 pencils!<br><br>The answer is 25.<br><br>I hope that's right! Math is kind of confusing, but I think I'm getting the hang of it. Can I have a sticker now?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know I'm supposed to follow some rules when doing math, but I don't really know what they are. I think it's something like "do the things inside the parentheses first"? But there aren't any parentheses here, so I'm not sure what to do.<br><br>Oh wait, I remember! We're supposed to do the multiplication before the addition! So, let's see... 2 times 4 is... carry the 1... 8! And then we add 5 to that, so... 13!<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so we have a math problem that looks like this: 5+2*4.<br><br>First, I know that the * means multiplication, so I'd do that part first. 2 times 4 is 8.<br><br>Now, it looks like this: 5 + 8.<br><br>Next, I know that the + means addition, so I'd do that part next. 5 plus 8 is 13.<br><br>So, the answer is 13!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hi! I'm a student in elementary school and I'm not sure what the order of operations is. But I think I can solve this problem by just doing the multiplication first.<br><br>So, 2 times 4 is 8.<br><br>Then, 5 plus 8 is 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

That's easy. Then, we've got the 3, and it's multiplying something. I'm not sure what that means, but I think it means we have to do the multiplication first.
