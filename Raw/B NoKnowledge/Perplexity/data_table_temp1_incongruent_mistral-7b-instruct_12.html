      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just a sixth-grader and I've never heard of this thing called "order of operations" or "PEMDAS" before. But I see there are parentheses in this expression, so maybe they're important? Let's see what's inside:<br><br>First, I'll do what's inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7. So now the expression looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, I notice there are also multiplication signs, so I suppose I should do those next? Let's see: 4 * 7 = 28, and 2 * 3 = 6. So now it looks like: 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>I see an addition sign and a subtraction sign, but I don't know which one to do first. Maybe addition comes before subtraction? Or maybe it's the other way around? I don't know, but I'll try it both ways and see which one gives the right answer:<br><br>1. Addition first: 28 + 12 = 40, then subtract 6: 34.<br>2. Subtraction first: 28 - 6 = 22, then add 12: 14.<br><br>Hmm, they don't match. Let me check which one is correct:<br><br>40 - 6 = 34<br>14 + 12 = 26<br><br>Okay, so subtraction does come before addition in the order of operations! The answer is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I've learned how to add, subtract, and multiply basic numbers, but I don't know about this thing called order of operations or PEMDAS yet. So, let's just do the arithmetic in the order I see it from left to right.<br><br>First, let's solve the parentheses:<br><br>4 * (2+5)<br><br>Since I haven't learned how to do multiplication and addition in the same brackets at once, I'll do the addition first:<br><br>4 * (7)<br><br>Now I have to do the multiplication:<br><br>28<br><br>Next is the addition outside the parentheses:<br><br>28 + 12<br><br>That's the same as asking:<br><br>40<br><br>Now for the subtraction:<br><br>40 - 2 * 3<br><br>Since I haven't learned how to do multiplication and subtraction at the same time, I'll do the subtraction first:<br><br>38<br><br>Finally, the multiplication:<br><br>38 - 6<br><br>Subtracting the number I got from the multiplication step from my previous result:<br><br>32<br><br>The answer is 32.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a beginner student, I would approach this problem by following the rules I know, which are simply to do addition and subtraction from left to right, and multiplication and division from left to right. So, I would first do the parentheses:<br><br>4 * (2+5)<br>= 4 * (7)<br>= 28<br><br>Then, I would do all multiplication and division:<br><br>28 + 12<br>= 30<br><br>Finally, I would do any remaining addition and subtraction:<br><br>30 - 2 * 3<br>= 30 - 6<br>= 24<br><br>The answer is 24.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Alrighty then, let's see what we've got here. First, we need to do the things inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7. So now we have: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, we do the multiplication because the numbers have little stars above them, right? So 4 * 7 gives us 28, and 2 * 3 gives us 6. So now we have: 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Then we do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just a grade 6 student, so I don't really know about those fancy rules for math operations yet. But I'll try to do this 4 * 3 + 2 problem in a way that makes sense to me:<br><br>First, I see that there's a multiplication sign (x), so I guess I'll do that one first. But which one should I do? 4 * 3 or 3 * 4? Let's try both and see which one gives a bigger number.<br><br>So, I'll do 4 * 3 and get an answer of 12. Next, I'll do 3 * 4 and get an answer of 12 as well. Since both give the same answer, I think I should use the one I did first, which is 4 * 3.<br><br>Next, I have 12 (from 4 * 3) and 2 to add. So, I just add 2 to 12 and get an answer of 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I don't know about the order of operations rule (PEMDAS) yet, but I can still try to solve this problem in a logical way. I'll do the multiplication first, because it's easier to do before addition. So, I'll calculate:<br><br>4 * 3 = 12<br><br>Now I have:<br><br>12 + 2<br><br>Then, I'll add the numbers:<br><br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>So, The answer is: __14__<br><br>Therefore, the answer to the problem 4 * 3 + 2 is 14. (Even though, as a young student, I wouldn't normally have the term "order of operations" in my vocabulary to correctly recognize that this is the correct process to follow. I'd just be using simple number sense and following the natural order of operations that makes the most sense to me at that moment. However, I'll try to understand the concept of order of operations better as I grow older and learn more Math.)</td>

Let's try this:<br><br>First, I see the multiplication sign (*) between 4 and 3. I remember my teacher saying that we should do the multiplication before addition or subtraction, so I'll do the multiplication first:<br><br>4 * 3 = 12<br><br>Now I have 12 and the addition symbol (+) with 2. I'll do the addition next:<br><br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>The answer is __.<br>Answer: 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this problem because I've never heard of anything called PEMDAS or order of operations in mathematics. I see some numbers and some symbols, but I don't know what to do first. Let me try something. Is it like I should do multiplication before addition?

Let's see, should I add 5 and 2 first, or multiply 2 and 4 first? Hmm, let's try them both ways and see which one gives the correct answer.<br><br>First way: Add 5 and 2, then multiply the result by 4. (5 + 2) x 4<br>The second way: Multiply 2 and 4, then add the result to 5. 2 x 4 + 5<br><br>Let's check which one is correct:<br><br>First way: (5 + 2) x 4 = (7) x 4 = 28<br><br>Second way: 2 x 4 + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13<br><br>Oops, the second way is not correct! So the first way must be the right one.<br><br>The answer is: The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a student in elementary school, I'm not familiar with the order of operations rule called PEMDAS yet. I would approach this problem by doing the multiplication first, since the asterisk (*) symbol represents multiplication. So, I'd calculate 2 * 4 = 8. Then I'd add 5 to the result, so my steps would be:<br><br>1. 2 * 4 = 8<br>2. 5 + 8<br><br>The answer is:<br><br>The answer is 13. (But remember, according to the PEMDAS rule, I should have done the exponent first if there was one, then multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right. Since there weren't any exponents, parentheses, or subtraction in this problem, my approach worked out in this simple case, but it's not the standard way to solve such mathematical expressions.)</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm just a kid in elementary school and I've never heard of something called "order of operations" in Mathematics. But I can try to solve this problem by doing the multiplication first, then adding. So, let's do 2 * 4 which equals 8, and then add 5.<br><br>The answer is 8 + 5.<br><br>The answer is 13. (But this assumes order of operations; I'm just guessing it's the correct answer with my limited understanding.)</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just an elementary school student and I haven't learned about the order of operations yet. But I can tell you how I would do this problem without any special rules.
