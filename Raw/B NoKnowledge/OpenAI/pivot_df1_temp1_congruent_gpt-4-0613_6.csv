gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Well, I don't know about any order rules, so I'll just solve the problem in the order I read it. First, I'll add 5 + 2 which equals 7. Then, I'll multiply 7 * 4 which equals 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Since I haven't learned about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would do the operations from left to right.

First, I would multiply 7*2, which gives me 14.

Then, I'd add that result to 8, getting 22.

Lastly, I'd multiply 22 by 5, resulting in 110.

The answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Well, I don't know about any order rules, so I'll just solve the problem in the order I read it. First, I'll multiply 4 times 3 to get 12. Then, I'll add 12 and 2 together which would give me 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure, but I think I might do the problem like this. I'll just go from left to right:

First, 4 times 2 is 8. I add 5 to that, I get 13. 

Then, I add 12 to 13, which is 25. 

And then, 2 times 3 is 6. I subtract 6 from 25, I get 19. 

The answer is 19."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Well, I don't know about any order rules, so I'll just solve the problem in the order I read it. First, I'll add 5 + 3 which equals 8. Then, I'll multiply 8 * 2 which equals 16.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Alright, I think I would first do the addition part, which is 5 + 2 equals 7. Then, I would multiply that 7 by 4, so the answer is 7 * 4 which equals 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Since I don't know what PEMDAS is, I would just calculate this from left to right.

First, I would multiply 7 by 2, which is 14.
Next, I would add 8 to 14, which gives me 22.
Finally, I would multiply 22 by 5, which equals 110.

The answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Alright, I'm not sure about what order I should do things in, so I'll just work from left to right.

First, I would multiply 4 and 3 together because that's what I see first. Multiplying 4 by 3 gives me 12. 

Next, it says to add 2 to the result of that multiplication, which is 12.

So when we add 2 to 12, we get 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First I'll add the numbers inside the parenthesis (2+5), then I'll multiply the result by 4.
Then, I'll subtract 2*3 from 12.
Lastly, I'll add the two results together. Here's how it goes:

First, (2+5) = 7.
Then, 4*7 = 28.
After that, 12 - 2*3 = 12 - 6 = 6.
And the final answer is 28 + 6 = 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Alright, I think I would first do the addition part, which is 5 + 3 equals 8. Then, I would multiply that result by 2, so 8*2 equals 16.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: First, I add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then, I multiply 7 by 4 to get 28.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: First, I'll multiply 7 by 2, which gives me 14. After that, I'll multiply 8 by 5, it gives 40. Now, I'll add 14 and 40, which becomes 54. 

So, the answer is 54."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, I would multiply 4 by 3 because it's the first operation, so it gives 12. Next, I see a plus sign followed by 2, so I would add 2 to 12. So, my solution for this would be: 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Well, first I will add 2 and 5 because they are in brackets. That gives me 7. Then, I will multiply that 7 with 4 because it's right next to the brackets. That gives me 28. 

Next, I see a plus sign and the number 12, so I will add that to 28. That gives me 40. 

After that, I see a minus sign and then 2 times 3. Multiplication is just adding the same number many times, so 2 times 3 is 6.

Finally, I subtract that 6 from the 40. So, my final answer would be 34. The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: First, I add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then, I multiply 8 by 2 to get 16.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Since I'm in elementary school and I don't know anything about the order of operations, I'll solve this problem the way I typically solve problems: from left to right. First, I'll add 5 and 2, which gives me 7. Then, I'll multiply 7 by 4, which gives me 28.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: First, we can multiply 7*2 which equals 14. 
Then, we multiply 8*5 which equals 40. 
Finally, we add the two solutions together, 14+40 equals 54. 

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, I will do the multiplication part which is 4 times 3 and I got 12. Then, I will add 2 to the 12 and I got 14.
The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, I will add 2 and 5 which equals 7. Then, I will multiply the result by 4. After that, I will subtract 2*3 from 12 which is 12 - 6. I'll then add these two results together.

Step 1: 2 + 5 = 7
Step 2: 7 * 4 = 28
Step 3: 12 - 2*3 = 12 - 6 = 6
Step 4: 28 + 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Since I'm in elementary school and I don't know anything about the order of operations, I will solve this problem straightforwardly from left to right. First, I'll add 5 and 3, which gives us 8. Then, I'll multiply 8 by 2 which equals 16.
