gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Um, I'm not sure how to do this, but I think I should just follow the order the numbers come in. So, first I will do the multiplication 4*7 which is 28. Then I will do the addition 28+12 which is 40. Then finally I will do the multiplication 2*3 which is 6. And then I'll do the subtraction 40-6 which is 34. So... the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we need to add 2 and 5 because of the parentheses, which equals 7. Then we multiply 4 and 7, which equals 28. After that, we do the multiplication of 2 and 3, which equals 6. After that, we add everything together. So, 28 plus 12 minus 6 equals 34. So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I just do the math inside the parentheses (2 + 5 = 7). Then I do the multiplication first (4 * 7 = 28) and (2 * 3 = 6). Then I do the addition and subtraction from left to right (28 + 12 - 6 = 34). So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I just solve what's inside the parentheses. 2 + 5 = 7. 

Then, I follow the operations from left to right.  
4 * 7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2 = 38
38 - 2 * 3 = 38 - 6 = 32

So the answer is 32."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: I don't know anything about order of operations, so I'm not sure how to solve this problem. The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, I just multiply 4 by 3 to get 12. Then, I add 2 to 12 and that gives me 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication, so it's 12+2. Then, you do the addition, so the answer is 14. 
The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, we just do the math from left to right. 4 times 3 equals 12. Then, we add 2 to 12, which gives us 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5+2*4,GPT Response: I don't know how to solve this problem.,"GPT Response: First, I add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then, I multiply 7 by 4 to get 28. So, the answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, I add 5 and 2, which equals 7. Then I multiply 7 by 4, which equals 28. So, the answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, I just add 5 and 2 together to get 7. Then I multiply 7 by 4 to get 28. So the final answer is 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5+3*2,GPT Response: I don't know how to solve this problem.,"GPT Response: First, I add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then, I multiply 8 by 2 to get 16. 
The answer is 16.","GPT Response: First, I do the multiplication, so it's 3*2 equals 6. Then, I add 5 to 6, and that equals 11. So, the answer is 11.","GPT Response: First, I just add 5 and 3 together to get 8. Then I multiply 8 by 2 to get 16. So the final answer is 16. 

The answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Um, I think you just, um, do the operations in the order they appear, like 7 times 2 first and then plus 8 times 5. So it would be like 14 plus 40, and then you add those together to get, um, 54. 

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, you just multiply the numbers from left to right, so 7 times 2 is 14 and 8 times 5 is 40. Then, you add the results together, so 14 plus 40 equals 54. 

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Um, I think you just do the operations from left to right. So first you do 7*2, which is 14. Then you do 8*5, which is 40. So the answer is 14+40, which is 54.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, I'll do 7*2, which is 14. Then, I'll do 8*5, which is 40. Finally, I'll add those two numbers together, which is 54. So the answer is 54."
