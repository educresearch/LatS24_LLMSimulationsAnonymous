      <td>GPT Response: First, you add 2 and 5 together because it's inside the parentheses, which gives you 7. Then, you multiply this with 4, giving you 28. Add 12 to this and you get 40. Then, you minus 2 times 3, or 6, from 40. So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we add the numbers in the parentheses because it's surrounded by the symbols that look like curves. So, 2 + 5 equals 7. After that, our problem is 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, we multiply 4 times 7 because that's the next thing we see after the parentheses and it gave us 28.<br><br>So, our problem is now 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.a<br><br>After that, we add 28 and 12 because that's the next thing we see. That equals 40. Now our problem is 40 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Finally, we subtract 2 times 3 from 40 because that's the only thing we haven't done yet. 2 times 3 is 6, and if we subtract 6 from 40, we'll get 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
