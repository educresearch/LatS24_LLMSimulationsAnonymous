gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, we need to perform the operations inside the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5, which equals 7. 

Next, we need to simplify the multiplication operation. We have 4 * 7, which equals 28.

Now, let's solve the remaining operations from left to right. We have 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, we need to perform the multiplication operation. We have 2 * 3, which equals 6.

Now, we have 28 + 12 - 6.

Finally, we can perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right. We have 40 - 6, which equals 34.

Therefore, the final answer is 34."

gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: In this problem, we have to follow the order of operations which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

However, since I don't know anything about order of operations, I'll just solve this problem from left to right.

First, I'll multiply 4 and 3, which is 12.

Then, I'll add 2 to 12, which is 14.

So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will follow the order of operations. First, I will solve anything in parentheses. In this case, there is (2 + 5). So, 2 + 5 equals 7.

Next, I will multiply 4 by 7. 4 * 7 equals 28.

Moving on to the next step, I will multiply 2 by 3. 2 * 3 equals 6.

Now, I will subtract 6 from 28. 28 - 6 equals 22.

Lastly, I will add 12 to 22. 12 + 22 equals 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34."
