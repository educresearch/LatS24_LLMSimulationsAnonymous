      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I'm not exactly sure what the rules are, but I heard some of my friends talking about doing the math inside the brackets first. So, I'm gonna do that.<br><br>I see (2 + 5) inside brackets, so I'll add those first because that's what you’re supposed to do, right?<br><br>2 + 5 equals 7.<br><br>Now my problem looks like this: 4*7 + 12 - 2*3.<br><br>Next, I think I have to do the multiplication before the addition and subtraction because multiplication is like a bigger deal or something.<br><br>So, 4 times 7 is 28.<br><br>And 2 times 3 is 6.<br><br>Now my problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Now I just have to add and subtract in the order it comes, I think that’s how it goes.<br><br>28 plus 12 is 40.<br><br>And then 40 minus 6 is 34.<br><br>So, after doing the math in that order, I think the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Ok, so I just learned this cool thing called the order of operations, and it tells me the right order to solve parts of a math problem. The way I remember it is with the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for:<br><br>P – Parentheses first<br>E – Exponents (like squares and square roots, etc.)<br>MD – Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)<br>AS – Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)<br><br>So according to these rules, I first solve whatever is inside the parentheses.<br><br>Step 1: Solve inside the parentheses (2 + 5)<br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now the math problem looks like this:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Step 2: Next, I do the multiplication (and division if I had any, from left to right).<br><br>So I'll multiply 4 times 7:<br>4 * 7 = 28<br><br>And then 2 times 3:<br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>So now our problem looks like this:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Step 3: Then, I do the addition and subtraction, from left to right.<br><br>First, I add 28 and 12:<br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>And then, I subtract 6 from that result:<br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So the final answer is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I don't know about special rules, but I might solve it like this: First, I would do the things inside the parentheses because it's like doing the smaller job before the big one. So, 2 plus 5 is 7. Now it looks like 4 times 7 plus 12 minus 2 times 3.<br><br>Next, if I had 4 groups of 7 things, that would give me 28 since 4 times 7 is 28. Then, my problem looks like this: 28 plus 12 minus 2 times 3.<br><br>Then I just do the adding and subtracting I see. So if I add 12 to 28, that's 40. Last, I have to do the 2 times 3 which is 6.<br><br>So now I have 40 minus 6 and that’s 34 because if I have 40 things and take away 6 things, I am left with 34 things.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, this is like when we do math problems where we follow rules to make sure everyone gets the same answer. My teacher said we should always do what's inside the parentheses first. So I will add the 2 plus 5 first, which is 7. Now the problem looks like this:<br><br>4*7 + 12 - 2*3<br><br>Then, she said there is a rule that says we have to multiply or divide before we add or subtract. So I have to do the multiplying parts:<br><br>4 times 7 is 28,<br>and 2 times 3 is 6.<br><br>Now my problem looks like:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Then I just go from left to right doing the adding and subtracting. So first I add 28 and 12, which is 40, and then I subtract 6 from 40:<br><br>40 - 6 is 34.<br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so, I'm in grade 6 and I just see this as a straightforward question. I think I just need to do the operations in the order they appear. I multiply 4 and 3 first because that's the first thing I see, which gives me 12. Then, I just have to add 2 to that result. The calculation would look like this:<br><br>4 * 3 = 12<br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm a sixth-grade student and haven't learned the order of operations (PEMDAS) yet, I might just try to solve the problem from left to right, just like how I read.<br><br>So first, I would do the multiplication because it's the first thing I see:<br>4 times 3 equals 12.<br><br>Next, I would add the 2:<br>12 plus 2 equals 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think I just do what's in the problem from left to right. So first I'd do 4 times 3 because that's the first thing I see, which is 12. Then I add 2 to that, because that's next. So, 12 plus 2 equals 14!<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I think I should do the multiplication part, because when we do math problems, we have to multiply before we add things. So, I will do 4 times 3 which is 12. After that, I should add the 2 to the 12.<br><br>So, 12 plus 2 equals 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so, I'm in grade 6 and I just see this as an addition and a multiplication thing. I heard a little from my big sister that we should do the times thing before the plus thing, but I'm not totally sure why. Just going to try it that way because she usually knows her stuff.<br><br>So first, I'll multiply 2 and 4, because that seems important, and that's 8. Then I just add the 5 to that, which gets me to 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I remember my teacher saying that there's a special rule for solving math problems like this one. It's called order of operations, I think, and it means I should do the multiplication part before I do the addition.<br><br>So first, I need to multiply 2 times 4 which is 8.<br><br>Then, I add 5 to that result. So 5 plus 8 equals 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think I just do it from left to right, like when I read a book. So, I would go 5 plus 2 is 7, and then I multiply 7 by 4, which is 28.<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: When we do math problems, it's like following steps in a recipe. Before we can put everything together to get the final answer, we have to make sure we do the steps in the right order. My teacher told me that when I see numbers and symbols like plus (+) and times (*), I should do the times part first, because it's like when we get ready in the morning, we have to put on our socks before we put on our shoes.<br><br>So for the problem 5 + 2 * 4, we should do the 2 * 4 part first. If I have 2 groups of 4, that's like 4 plus another 4, which makes 8.<br><br>After we have done the times part, we can add the 5. So now it’s like having 5 plus the 8 we just got, and if I count 5 and then 8 more, I get 13.<br><br>So, the answer is 13.</td>

I heard a little from my big sister that we should do the times thing before the plus thing, but I'm not sure how that works exactly.<br><br>But let's try it that way.

      <td>GPT Response: To solve this math problem, we need to follow the rules of order of operations.

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I'm not really sure about any special rules for doing math problems with different operations, but I can try to work it out step by step. I know that multiplication and addition are different, and it seems like maybe we should do each part as it comes along. <br><br>So first there is 7 times 2, which I know is 14 because I've practiced my multiplication tables. Then there is 8 times 5, and I know that's 40 because I learned that one too.<br><br>Now I just have to add those two results together: 14 (from the 7 times 2) plus 40 (from the 8 times 5).<br><br>14 + 40 is 54, so if I just do each part and then put them together, I get 54.<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Alright, since I'm just learning and don't know about the order of operations yet (PEMDAS), I would do the operations from left to right.<br><br>First, I would multiply 7 by 2, which is 14.<br><br>7 * 2 = 14<br><br>Then, I would add that to the result of 8 multiplied by 5.<br><br>8 * 5 = 40<br><br>Now, I add the two results together:<br><br>14 + 40 = 54<br><br>So, the final answer is:<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I think I just do the math in the order I see it. So first I would multiply 7 times 2 which makes 14. Then I would do 8 times 5 which is 40. After that, I guess I just add those two together... So 14 plus 40 is 54! <br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
