      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would just calculate it as it's written from left to right. Here's how I would do it:<br><br>First, I would do the multiplication: 4 * 2 = 8.<br>Then, I add 5 to get 8 + 5 = 13.<br>Then, I add 12 to get 13 + 12 = 25.<br>Finally, I subtract 2 times 3, which is 6, so 25 - 6 = 19.<br><br>The answer is 19.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I am not sure about the right order to solve this, but I'll try:<br>First, I'll solve the numbers in the brackets, so 2 + 5 equals 7.<br>Then, I'll multiply 4 with that result, so 4 * 7 equals 28.<br>Next, I'll add 12 to that number, so 28 + 12 equals 40.<br>Finally,  I'll subtract 2*3 which is 6 from 40, so 40 - 6 equals 34.<br>So, based on my calculations, The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I'd just solve this from left to right.<br><br>First, I'd multiply 4 with 2, which gives us 8. Then, I'd add 5 to 8, which makes it 13.<br><br>Next, I'd add 12, making 25. <br>Then, I subtract 2, making it 23.<br>Finally, I multiply by 3, ending up with 69.<br><br>The answer is 69.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm an elementary student who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I would just solve the problem from left to right.<br><br>First, I'll add 2 and 5 which gives me 7.<br>Then, I multiply 4 and 7 which equals 28.<br>Next, I add 12 to 28 which gives me 40.<br>Finally, I subtract 2 multiplied by 3 (which is 6) from 40.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
