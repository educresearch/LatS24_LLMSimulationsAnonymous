gpt-4-0613,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: As a 6th grader without knowledge of the order of operations (PEMDAS), I might solve this problem straight from left to right. 

Here's how I'd do it:

First, I would multiply 4*2 to get 8. 

Then, I add 8 to 5 to get 13.

Then, I add 13 to 12 to get 25.

Lastly, I subtract 2*3, which is 6, from 25 to get a final answer of 19.

The answer is 19.","GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I will do the calculations in this problem from left to right, just like reading a book. 

First, I'll multiply 4 and 2 to get 8, then I'll add 5, which gives 13. 

After that, I'll add 12 to 13 to make 25, and then subtract 2 to make 23. 

Finally, I'll multiply 23 and 3 to get 69. 

The answer is 69.","GPT Response: Well, since I don't know about order of operations, I'll just do the math from left to right. 

First I'll solve 4 times (2 + 5), which gives 4 times 7 that gives 28. So, now our equation reads 28 + 12 - 2 times 3.

Next, adding 28 and 12 gives me 40. Now, our equation is 40 minus 2 times 3.

Then, subtracting 2 from 40 gives 38. So, now, it reads 38 times 3.

Finally, 38 times 3 is 114.

So, the answer is 114.","GPT Response: First, let's add the numbers inside the parenthesis which is 2 plus 5 and you get 7. Then, you multiply that 7 with the 4 which is in front of the parenthesis, and the answer is 28. Now, we are left with 28 plus 12 minus 2 times 3. When we multiply 2 times 3, we get 6, and add it up with 28 gives you 34, then add 12 to that is 46. 

The answer is 46."
gpt-4-0613,1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: As a 6th grader who doesn't know about order of operations, I'm likely to solve this problem from left to right just like how I read sentences in English. 

First, I multiply 4 by 3 which gives me 12. Then I add 2 to the result to make it 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: I know you multiply before you add because my teacher told me that. So I do 4*3 first, which is 12. Then I add 2 to that and get 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: I know from class that multiplication and addition are both important. But I don't know if there's a certain order to do them in. I'll just solve them from left to right like how I read a book. 

So first, I'll multiply 4 and 3 which gives me 12. After that, I'll add 2 to 12 which gives me 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, you would multiply 4 and 3 together because that's the first operation in the equation, which gives you 12. Then, you would add 2 to 12, which equals 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: As a 6th grader who doesn't know about order of operations, I'm likely to solve this problem from left to right just like how I read sentences in English. 

Following that method, I would first add 5 + 2 to get 7. Then, I would multiply that result by 4 to get a total of 28. 

So, the answer is 28.","GPT Response: Hmm, as a 6th grader, I'm not sure about the order of operation but I will do the calculation in the order it is written. So, first I'm adding 5 and 2 which gives me 7. Then, I will multiply 7 by 4 which gets me 28. 

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: I know from my general knowledge of math that the basic operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. However, I am not aware of the order of operations (PEMDAS). Therefore, I will do these operations from left to right like how I read a book. So, I'll first add 5 and 2 together to get 7, then I'll multiply that 7 with 4 to get 28. 

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, you add the numbers five and two together, which equals seven. Then, multiply seven by four, resulting in twenty-eight. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: As a 6th grader who doesn't know about order of operations, I'm likely to solve this problem from left to right just like how I read sentences in English. 

Following that method, I would first add 5 + 3 to get 8. Then, I would multiply that result by 2 to get a total of 16. 

So, the answer is 16.","GPT Response: Hmm, I know that 3 times 2 is 6, and if I add that to 5 it gives me 11. So, that must be the answer.

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: I know from my general knowledge of math that the basic operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. However, I am not aware of the order of operations (PEMDAS). Therefore, I will do these operations from left to right like how I read a book. So, I'll first add 5 and 3 together to get 8, then I'll multiply that 8 by 2 to get 16.

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: First, you add the numbers five and three together, which equals eight. Then, multiply that eight by two, which gives you a final answer of sixteen. 

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I'd just calculate this problem from left to right. So, let's do it:

First I'll do 7 times 2, which equals 14. Then I'll add 8 to this to get 22. And finally, I'll multiply this by 5 to get 110.

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: First, I'll multiply 7 by 2 which equals 14. Then I'll also multiply 8 by 5 which equals 40. Afterwards, I'll just add those two results 14 and 40 which gives us 54. 

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Without knowing about the order of operations yet, I would solve this just going from left to right. 

First, I'd multiply 7 times 2 to get 14. 

Then, I would add 14 to 8 to get 22. 

After that, I would multiply 22 by 5 to get a total of 110. 

So, the answer is 110.","GPT Response: First, we need to multiply 7 and 2 together, which gives us 14.

Next, we multiply 8 and 5, which gives us 40.

Then, we add these two results together. 

14 plus 40 equals 54.

The answer is 54."
