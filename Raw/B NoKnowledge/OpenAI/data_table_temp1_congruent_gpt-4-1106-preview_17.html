      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm in grade 6 and haven't learned about the order of operations yet, I might try to solve the problem step by step from left to right, like reading a book. So here's my attempt:<br><br>First I see 4*(2 + 5), and I remember that multiplication is just repeated addition, so I should do that part first.<br><br>I would add 2 + 5, which gives me 7. Then I multiply 4 by 7, which gives me 28. So now, the problem looks like this:<br>28 + 12 - 2*3<br><br>Following the left-to-right approach again:<br>First, I would add 28 and 12 together because that's the first operation I see. This gives me 40.<br>Then I subtract 2*3. First, I multiply 2 by 3 which gives me 6.<br>So now I take the 40 and subtract 6, which leaves me with 34.<br><br>So with my current knowledge, I would say:<br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm a 6th grader and don't know about order of operations yet, I would just try to solve it from left to right as I see it:<br><br>First, I would do the multiplication because I remember that we have to do "times" before we do "plus":<br>4 * 2 is 8, and then 4 * 5 is 20.<br><br>So now I have 8 + 20 + 12 - 2*3.<br><br>Next, I'm going to do the addition because that's the next thing I see:<br>8 + 20 is 28, and 28 + 12 is 40.<br><br>Now it's 40 - 2*3.<br><br>Then I do the multiplication:<br>2 * 3 is 6.<br><br>So now it's 40 - 6.<br><br>Finally, I'll do the subtraction:<br>40 - 6 is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Um, okay! I think you just do things like, from left to right, right? So here's what I would do:<br><br>First, I see 4 and there's this star thingy which I think is like "times" so I do 4 "times" (2 + 5). But there are these parentheses things, so I think I add 2 + 5 first. So, 2 plus 5 is 7.<br><br>Now it’s 4 times 7, which is like four 7s added together. So 7 plus 7 is 14, then another 7 is 21, and then another one is 28.<br><br>After that, I have to add 12. So I have 28 and then I add 12. That's easy! 28 and 10 would be 38, then add 2 more makes it 40.<br><br>So now I have 40, and then I take away 2 "times" 3... which is like 2 plus another 2 plus another 2. So 2 plus 2 is 4, plus another 2 is 6.<br><br>So I take the 40 and take away 6, which is like if I have 40 cookies and I give away 6. I would end up with... umm... I think 34 cookies because 40 minus 10 is 30, but it's only 6, so it's 4 more, yeah!<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I know we have to do the thing in the parentheses, that's the rule! So 2 + 5 is 7.<br><br>Then we have 4 times that, so 4 * 7, which is like having 7 four times. That's 28!<br><br>Next, we have to add 12 to it, so 28 + 12. That's like having two tens which is 20 and then 8 and 2 which is 10, so 20 + 10 makes 30.<br><br>So now we have 28 + 30, which gives us 58.<br><br>Then we have to take away 2 times 3, which is like saying 2 three times. That's 6!<br><br>So we have 58 and we take away 6, and that's like having 50 and then taking away 5 to make 45, and then taking away one more to make 44.<br><br>So my final answer is 44!<br><br>The answer is 44.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think I've heard my teacher talk about this. We're supposed to do the multiplication part before we do the addition part.<br><br>So first we multiply 4 times 3 which is 12.<br><br>Then we add the 2 to that, so 12 plus 2 is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, we have to solve 4 times 3 and then add 2 to it. So first, I'm going to multiply 4 by 3, which is 12. Then, I'll just add 2 to that result. So 12 plus 2 is 14. <br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations yet, I might just solve this from left to right as I see it.<br><br>First, I would do the multiplication because I know that when you have a number next to a multiplication sign and another number, it means you need to put them together by multiplying.<br><br>So 4 times 3 is 12.<br><br>Then I would add the 2. So, 12 plus 2.<br><br>12 + 2 is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: When I look at the math problem 4*3 + 2, I think that I should start with the multiplication because I heard that you have to do "times" or multiplication before you do addition.

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think I'm supposed to do something special when there are different math things like pluses and times in the same problem. My older sibling mentioned that I should always do the times part before the plus part. So first, I should do 2 times 4, which is 8, and then add that to 5.<br><br>So it's like this: first I do 2 * 4 = 8, and then I take that 8 and add it to the 5, so 5 + 8 = 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: If I don't know about the order of operations, I might just do the math from left to right because that's how I read. So here's what I would do:<br><br>First, I take 5 and add 2 which makes 7.<br>Then, I take the 7 and multiply by 4 which makes 28.<br><br>So, I would say, "The answer is 28."</td>
      <td>GPT Response: When I look at the math problem 5 + 2*4, I think that I should start with the first numbers I see, which are 5 and 2. So I add those together and get 7. Then I see that there's a 4 that I have to multiply. So I take the 7 and multiply it by 4 which gives me 28. <br><br>So I think the answer is 28.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh boy, I don't really know about this order of operations thing well. But I think I should start with doing the multiplication first because that's what my big brother does. So I'll do 7 times 2 first which is 14, and then 8 times 5 which is 40. After that, I add those two results together. So, 14 plus 40 is 54. So I think the answer is 54.<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I'm not really sure how to solve this because I haven't learned the fancy rules, but I think you do multiplication before addition. So, I'd multiply 7 by 2 to get 14 and then multiply 8 by 5 to get 40. Then I'd add those two results together. So 14 plus 40 equals 54.<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I would just add and multiply in the order they appear from left to right since I don't know about order of operations. So, here's what I would do:<br><br>First, I'd multiply 7 times 2 which is 14.<br>Then, I'd take that answer, 14, and add the next number which is 8. So, 14 plus 8 is 22.<br>Lastly, I’d multiply 22 by 5 because that's the next number in the problem.<br><br>So, 22 times 5 is 110.<br><br>The answer is 110.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, since I’m in elementary school and haven't learned about order of operations yet, I think I just solve the problem from left to right.<br><br>So first I would multiply 7 by 2 which is 14, because I know that 7 plus 7 is 14.<br><br>Then I would take that 14 and add it to the next number which is 8, so 14 plus 8 is 22.<br><br>Then I would multiply that 22 by 5 because that's the next number in the problem. So if I have 22, and I add it to itself 5 times, that would be 22 plus 22 plus 22 plus 22 plus 22. I can do this in parts, so first, 22 plus 22 is 44, then another 22 makes 66, and then another one makes 88, and the last one makes 110.<br><br>So I think the answer is 110.<br><br>The answer is 110.</td>
