gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Um, I don't really know what to do here. Do I add the 5 and 2 first, or do I multiply 2 and 4 first? I think I'll just do the adding first. So, 5 + 2 is 7. Then I'll multiply 7 by 4, and that gives me 28.

The answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Um, I don't really know how to do this, but my friend told me that we should just do the operations from left to right. So first, we do 7*2, which is 14. Then we add 8*5, which is 40. So the answer is 14+40. The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Um, I don't really know what to do here. Do I just start from the left and go to the right? So, 4 times 3 is 12. Then I add 2 to that, which is 14. So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Umm...I think I just do the operations from left to right, so first, I do 4*(2+5) which is 4*7, then I add 12 to that which is 28, then I subtract 2*3 which is 6. So the answer is 22."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Um, I don't really know what to do here, but maybe I just solve it from left to right. So, 5 + 3 = 8 and then times 2 is 16. So, the answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: So I just add 5 and 2 first, then multiply that sum with 4. It looks like this: (5+2)*4 = 7*4. Then I multiply 7 and 4 to get 28. 
The answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: First, I just multiply 7 and 2 to get 14, and then I multiply 8 and 5 to get 40. After that, I add the two products together, so 14 + 40 equals 54. So the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: So I just do the multiplication first, which is 4*3, and then add 2 to the result. So it's 12+2, which is 14. So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First I will add the numbers inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.
Then I will multiply 4 by 7: 4 * 7 = 28.
Next, I will multiply 2 by 3: 2 * 3 = 6.
Then I will add the results together: 28 + 12 - 6 = 34.
So the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3*2,"GPT Response: So, I don't know much about this order of operations thing, but I think I should first do the multiplication before the addition. So, I'll do 3*2 which equals 6, and then I'll add 5 to it, which is 11. The answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: First, I'll do the operation with the multiplication and then the addition. So, 2*4 = 8, and then 5+8 = 13. 
The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Um, I don't really know how to do this, but I think I just need to do the math from left to right? So, 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40. Then I just add those together, so 14 plus 40 is 54. Um, the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Um, I don't really know how to do the order of operations, but my teacher always says we should do the multiplication or division first before adding or subtracting. So, I think we should do 4*3 first, which is 12, and then add 2. So, 12+2 is 14. 
The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Umm, I think I just need to do the math in the order it's written. So first, I'll add 2 and 5. That equals 7. Then I'll multiply 4 by 7, which is 28. After that, I'll do 2 times 3, which is 6. Finally, I'll add 12 to 28 and subtract 6 from that total. So the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: First, you do 3 times 2, which equals 6. Then you add 5, which equals 11.
The answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2*4,"GPT Response: First, I will do 5 + 2, which equals 7. Then I will multiply that by 4, which equals 28. So the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: First, I will multiply 7 and 2 to get 14. Then, I will multiply 8 and 5 to get 40. Finally, I will add 14 and 40 to get the final answer. 

The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*3+2,"GPT Response: First, I will do 4 times 3, which equals 12. Then I will add 2 to 12, which equals 14. So the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: So first, you have to do the operations inside the parentheses. 
So 2+5 is 7. Then you can do the multiplication and addition in order from left to right. 
4*7 is 28, and then 28+12 is 40. 
And then 2*3 is 6. 
Finally, you do the subtraction, so 40-6 is 34. 
So the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+3*2,"GPT Response: First, I will do 3*2 which is 6. Then I will add 5 to 6, which is 11. So, the answer is 11."
