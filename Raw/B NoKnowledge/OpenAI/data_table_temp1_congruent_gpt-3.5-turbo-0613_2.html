      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to use the order of operations which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).<br>First, I see there are parentheses, so I need to solve what is inside them first.<br>Inside the parentheses, I have 2 + 5 which is equal to 7.<br>Now, I have 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3 left.<br>Next, I need to solve the multiplication. 4 * 7 is equal to 28 and 2 * 3 is equal to 6.<br>Now, I have 28 + 12 - 6 left.<br>Lastly, I need to solve the addition and subtraction from left to right.<br>28 + 12 is equal to 40 and 40 - 6 is equal to 34.<br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Um, okay, so in this problem we have some numbers and some operations. I think we should start with the things in parentheses first. So, inside the parentheses, we add 2 and 5 together. That gives us 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7. That gives us 28. <br>Next, we have to do the multiplication and subtraction. So, I think we should do the multiplication first. We have 2 times 3, which is 6. <br>Then, we have to add and subtract. We have 28 plus 12, which is 40. And then we subtract 6 from that, which gives us 34. <br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. First, we do the calculations inside the parentheses. 2 + 5 equals 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. Next, we have addition and subtraction. We add 28 and 12 to get 40. Lastly, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3 from 40. 2 multiplied by 3 equals 6, so we subtract 6 from 40. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
