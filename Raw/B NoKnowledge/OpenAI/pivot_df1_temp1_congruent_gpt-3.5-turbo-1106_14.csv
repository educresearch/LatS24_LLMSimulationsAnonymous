gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2*4,GPT Response: I don't know how to solve this problem.
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Ummm, I think I just do the multiplication first and then add the numbers together. So, 7*2 is 14 and 8*5 is 40. Then I add 14 + 40. The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,GPT Response: I don't know how to solve this problem.
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Hmm, let's see. I'll just start from the left and do the operations as they come. First, I'll add 2 and 5 to get 7. Then I'll multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. After that, I'll subtract 2 from 12 to get 10. Finally, I'll multiply 2 by 3 to get 6. Now I'll just do 28 plus 10 minus 6. So, the answer is 32."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,GPT Response: I don't know how to solve this problem.
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: First, I need to do the multiplication first, so I'll do 2*4 which equals 8. Then I add 5 to 8, which equals 13. 
So the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: First, I just need to do the operations from left to right. So, 7*2 is 14 and 8*5 is 40. Then, I just add those two together. 
The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, I need to do the multiplication, so 4*3 equals 12. Then I add 2, which gives me 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: I don't know anything about the order of operations, but I'll just do the operations from left to right. 

First, I'll calculate inside the parentheses: 
2 + 5 = 7

Then I'll continue with the multiplication and addition in order: 
4 * 7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2 = 38
38 * 3 = 114

So, the answer is 114."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: First, I need to do the multiplication first, so I'll do 3*2 which equals 6. Then I add 5 to 6, which equals 11. 
So the answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Um, I think you just do the operations from left to right. So, first you do 5 + 2, which is 7. Then you multiply that by 4, which is 28. So, the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Umm... okay, so first I do the multiplication for 7*2 and 8*5. Then I add the results together. So, 7*2 is 14 and 8*5 is 40. Then, I add 14 and 40 together, which is 54. So, the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Um, I think you just do the operations from left to right. So, first you do 4 times 3 which is 12. Then you add 2 to 12 which is 14. So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication inside the parentheses. So, 4*(2 + 5) becomes 4*7. Then, you do that multiplication, so 4*7 is 28. Next, you do the multiplication 2*3, which is 6. Now you can add and subtract from left to right, so 28 + 12 is 40, and 40 - 6 is 34. So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication, then you add. So, 3 times 2 equals 6. Then you add 5. 
The answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication which is 2*4, and my teacher said that we should do the multiplication or division first before addition or subtraction. So, 2*4 is 8. Then we add 5 to 8. So, the answer is 13. 
The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: First, we just do what the math says, so we start with 7 times 2, which equals 14, and then we add 8 times 5, which is 40. So the answer is 14 plus 40. 

The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication which is 4*3, and then we add 2 to the product. 

4*3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, we need to do the operations inside the parentheses. So, 2 + 5 equals 7. Then, we have to multiply 4 by 7 which equals 28. After that, we add 12 to 28 which equals 40. Next, we subtract 2 times 3 which equals 6. Finally, we subtract 6 from 40 which equals 34. So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication which is 3*2, and that equals 6. Then, we add 5 to 6 which equals 11. So, the answer is 11."
