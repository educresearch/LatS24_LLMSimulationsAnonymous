I might just do the math from left to right as I read it. So that means I would add 5 and 2 first, because that comes first when I read it.

So, 5 + 2 is 7.

Next, I would multiply that 7 by 4, because that's the next part of the problem.

7 times 4 is 28.

Now, I have to do the multiplication parts. So I'll multiply 4 by the number I got from the parentheses, which is 7.

There's another multiplication I see: 2 * 3.

28 + 12 - 6

First, we should do the operations inside parentheses. So, if we look at 2+5, we add those numbers together first.

2 + 5 = 7

Now we replace the (2+5) with 7 in the original equation:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we should do the multiplication before we do addition and subtraction. So we multiply 4 times 7, and also 2 times 3:

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now we replace the multiplication we have done:

28 + 12 - 6

Now we just have addition and subtraction left, and we can do those from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40

So it's like if I have 4 groups of 3, that makes 12, right? Then I just have to add the 2 at the end. So, 12 plus 2 is like having 12 cookies and then getting 2 more, which makes 14 cookies! Yay!

The answer is 14."

So now we have 4 times 7, plus 12, minus 2 times 3. 

4 times 7 is 28. Then we have to add 12 to 28, which gives us 40.

And we still have to subtract 2 times 3, which is 6, from our total.

So, 40 minus 6 equals 34. That's our final answer. 

The answer is 34."

My teacher said that we have to do multiplication and division before we do addition and subtraction. That's kind of like when you have to eat your veggies before you can have dessert!

In this problem, I see that there is a 3 multiplied by 2, and that needs to be done first. So, let's do that part:

3 * 2 equals 6.

Now we just have to add that result to 5, which is the other number in our problem. So now it's like:

5 + 6.

And 5 plus 6 is 11.

The answer is 11."
