      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations called PEMDAS. First, we need to solve the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we have 2+5 which equals 7. So now the problem becomes 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. Next, we need to solve the multiplication and division from left to right. 4 * 7 equals 28 and 2 * 3 equals 6. Now the problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6. Lastly, we add and subtract from left to right. 28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 6 equals 34. <br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we can solve the operations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.<br>Next, we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28.<br>Then, we multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6.<br>After that, we subtract 6 from 28, which equals 22.<br>Finally, we add 12 to 22, which equals 34.<br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we start by using the numbers and symbols in the order they appear. First, we see the parentheses (the numbers inside the brackets). We add 2 and 5 together, which gives us 7.<br><br>Next, we multiply 4 by 7, which gives us 28.<br><br>Then, we move on to the next operations. We add 12 to 28, which gives us 40.<br><br>Finally, we have to subtract 2 multiplied by 3 from 40. We multiply 2 by 3, which gives us 6. Then we subtract 6 from 40, which gives us 34.<br><br>So the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I need to figure out what to do inside the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, there is 2 + 5, which is equal to 7. Then, I have to multiply 4 by 7, so the result is 28. After that, I can move on to the rest of the problem. Next, I need to multiply 2 by 3, which is equal to 6. Then, I have to subtract 6 from 28, which gives me 22. Finally, I need to add 12 to 22. So, the answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to use the order of operations. The order of operations tells me that I should start by doing any calculations within parentheses first, but there are no parentheses in this problem. Next, I need to do any multiplication or division from left to right. So, I will multiply 2 by 4 to get 8. Finally, I will add 5 to 8, which equals 13. Therefore, the answer is 13.</td>
