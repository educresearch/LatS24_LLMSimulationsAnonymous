      <td>GPT Response: I have no idea what the order of operations is, but I'll just solve it from left to right. First, I'll do the multiplication inside the parentheses: 4 * 7. Then I'll add 12. After that, I'll do the multiplication of 2 and 3. So, the answer is 40.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I don't really know this 'PEMDAS' thing, but my teacher said I should start with the operations inside the parentheses first. So, 2 + 5 equals 7. Then I should do the multiplication first before the addition and subtraction, so 4 * 7 equals 28 and 2 * 3 equals 6. Then I just have to add and subtract in order from left to right, so 28 + 12 equals 40 and 40 - 6 equals 34. So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the brackets (2+5), which equals 7. Then we do the multiplication 4 * 7, which equals 28. After that, we do the multiplication 2 * 3, which equals 6. Next, we add 12 to 28, which equals 40. Finally, we subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34. So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, perform the operations inside the parentheses. 2 + 5 equals 7. Then, we do the multiplication and division from left to right. So, 4 * 7 is 28. Next, we do 2 * 3, which equals 6. Then, we do the additions and subtractions from left to right. 28 + 12 is 40, and 40 - 6 is 34. Therefore, <br>the answer is 34.</td>
