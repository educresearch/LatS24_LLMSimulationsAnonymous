4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3

I should do the (2+5) part first. So that's like:

2 + 5 = 7

Now I replace that part in the problem:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

The next thing the order of operations says is to do any multiplication or division before adding or subtracting, from left to right. So I need to do the 4 * 7 and the 2 * 3 parts next.

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Putting those back into the problem, I get:

28 + 12 - 6

Now I just go from left to right to do the addition and subtraction because that's what's left. So first, add 28 and 12:

28 + 12 = 40

So first, I see 4 times 3, which is like having four groups of three. So, 4 times 3 is 12, because 3+3+3+3 is 12.

And then I add 2 to that, so 12 plus 2 is 14.

The answer is 14."

I remember my teacher told us about this thing called ""PEMDAS"" to help us with math problems! It stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So, first, we do the Parentheses part, which is (2+5):

4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3
= 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we do Multiplication and Division from left to right. We have two multiplication parts to do: 4 * 7 and 2 * 3.

= 28 + 12 - 6

Then, we do Addition and Subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So, the final answer is 34! 

The answer is 34."
