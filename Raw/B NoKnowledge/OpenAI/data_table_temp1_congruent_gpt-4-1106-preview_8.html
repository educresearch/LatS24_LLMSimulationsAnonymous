      <td>GPT Response: Okay, since I'm just learning about order of operations, I'm going to try and work this out step by step. I heard from my teacher that we're supposed to do what's inside the parentheses first. So looking at the problem, I'll start there.<br><br>First, I see:<br><br>2 + 5<br><br>If I add those together, I get 7.<br><br>So now the problem looks like this:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>My teacher mentioned that multiplication comes before addition and subtraction, so I'm going to do the multiplication parts next.<br><br>First I'll multiply 4 by 7:<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br><br>And then I'll multiply 2 by 3:<br><br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>Now the problem looks like:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Now I just have to add and subtract in the order they appear.<br><br>So, I add 28 and 12 first because that comes next:<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>Last, I subtract 6 from 40:<br><br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So I think the answer should be 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Alright, to solve this problem, we need to remember that we should do the operations inside parentheses first. So first, I'll add the 2 + 5.<br><br>2 + 5 equals 7.<br><br>Now, we replace the 2 + 5 with 7 to see what we have next:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, we have to do the multiplication before we do the addition or subtraction. So, we multiply 4 times 7, and 2 times 3.<br><br>4 * 7 equals 28.<br>2 * 3 equals 6.<br><br>Now we replace those multiplications with their results:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Now, we just have addition and subtraction left. We do these from left to right.<br><br>First, add 28 and 12:<br><br>28 + 12 equals 40.<br><br>Lastly, subtract 6 from 40:<br><br>40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>So the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations yet, I might just try to solve it from left to right like I read a sentence.<br><br>First, I see 4 times something, so I'd do that first:<br><br>4 * (2 + 5)<br><br>Then I'd add the numbers in the parentheses because that seems like a separate little problem:<br><br>4 * 7<br><br>That gives me:<br><br>28<br><br>Next, I see there's a plus 12, so I'd add that to the 28:<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>After that, there's a minus 2 times 3, I'd probably just subtract 2 next because I don't know I need to multiply first:<br><br>40 - 2 = 38<br><br>And then I'd multiply the 3 last because it's at the end:<br><br>38 * 3 = 114<br><br>But since I was supposed to follow the order of operations, my answer might not be right. Still, based on what I know, I'd say:<br><br>The answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so to figure this out, we just need to do things step by step like how my teacher showed in class. First, we need to do what's inside the brackets. That's because brackets mean we have to do that part first. So we have 2 + 5 inside the brackets. That's easy!<br><br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Then, we have to take care of the multiplication before we add or subtract anything else. So we need to multiply the 4 by the 7 we just found from adding 2 and 5 together.<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br><br>Now, we need to figure out the part with the subtracting and multiplying at the end, which is 12 - 2*3. But we need to do the multiplying part first, before we do the subtracting, because multiplying comes before subtracting in the order. So we do 2 * 3 first.<br><br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>So, now we've got all our pieces, and we can put it together like this: <br><br>28 (that's the 4*(2 + 5) part) + 12 - 6 (that's the 12 - 2*3 part).<br><br>Now we just add and subtract in order:<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>4*3 + 2</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think I remember my teacher talking about something like this. We have to do some things before others when we see numbers and symbols in a math problem, just like how we follow steps in a recipe. So, I think we have to do the multiplication part before we add. So first, I'll multiply 4 by 3, and then I'll add the 2 afterwards. Let's do it step by step:<br><br>First step: Multiply 4 by 3 to get 12.<br><br>Now, we have 12 + 2.<br><br>Second step: Add 12 to 2 to get 14.<br><br>So, putting it all together, the calculation goes like this:<br><br>4 times 3 is 12, and then plus 2 makes 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: So even though I don't know the formal order of operations (PEMDAS), I can still solve this using basic math skills. First, I'll multiply 4 by 3 because multiplication is like doing addition several times. So, 4 times 3 gives me 12. After that, I need to add 2 to that result. So, 12 plus 2 gives me 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about order of operations yet, I might just solve this from left to right like reading a book.<br><br>First, I see 4 times 3, which is 12.<br>Then I add the 2 to the 12 and get 14.<br><br>So I would say the answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, I think I can just add and multiply in the order the numbers come. So first I can do 4 times 3, which is 12, and then add 2 to that. 12 plus 2 equals 14!<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I'm not quite sure how to do this, but I think I remember hearing something about doing multiplication before addition. Let's try that!<br><br>First, I'll do the multiplication part:<br>2 * 4 = 8<br><br>Now, I'll add that to 5:<br>5 + 8 = 13<br><br>So, I think the answer is 13. The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure about the rules for the order of doing things in math, but I think you might have to do the multiplying part before you add things. So if I do the multiplication first:<br><br>2 times 4 is 8.<br><br>Then, after that, if I add the 5:<br><br>5 plus 8 is 13.<br><br>So I think, without knowing those special math rules, I'd say:<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about order of operations, I would just solve this from left to right like reading a book! So I would first add 5 plus 2 to get 7, and then I would multiply 7 by 4 to get 28. So, I would say:<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: When we do math problems, we have to do the multiplication part before we do the addition part. So first we multiply 2 times 4. That gives us 8. Then we add that to 5. So 5 plus 8 is 13. <br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I'm not quite sure how to do this, but I think what you do first is just go from left to right, like reading a book. So, I'll add 5 + 3 first because that's the first thing I see. That makes 8, right? Then, I'll take that 8 and multiply it by 2 because that's the next thing in the problem. 8 times 2 is 16. So, I think the answer is 16. <br><br>The answer is 16.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: So even though I don't know the formal order of operations (PEMDAS), I can still try to solve it! If I just go from left to right, I would first do the addition and then the multiplication.<br><br>So I would add 5 and 3 together first, which is 8. Then, I would multiply that by 2.

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, uh, I think I remember my teacher talking about something where you do multiplication before you do addition. So, I guess I would do the multiplications first. Let's do that.<br><br>First, I multiply 7 by 2, which I know is 14. Then I multiply 8 by 5, which is 40. <br><br>So it looks like this now:<br><br>14 + 40<br><br>Now I just add those together. 14 plus 40 is 54.<br><br>So, um, I think the answer is 54.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, okay! So we just do the math from left to right, like when we read a book! First I do 7 times 2 which is 14. Then I have 14 plus something.

      <td>GPT Response: To solve this, we can first multiply the numbers and then add them up! So first I'm going to multiply 7 by 2, which is 14. Then I'm going to multiply 8 by 5, which is 40.
