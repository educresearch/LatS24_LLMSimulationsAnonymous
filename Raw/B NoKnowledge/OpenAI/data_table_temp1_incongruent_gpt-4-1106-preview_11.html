      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think I kinda remember some of my older friends talking about this. They said something like "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally" or...wait, no, they said it stands for some math rule thingy: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction. I guess you're supposed to do math in that order.<br><br>So, let's try out what they said:<br><br>First, we do what's inside the parentheses:<br>(2+5) which equals 7.<br><br>Then, we do multiplication and division from left to right:<br>4 times that 7 we just found. 4 * 7 is 28. <br>After that, we also do the other multiplication which is 2 * 3. That's 6.<br><br>Now, what we have left is:<br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Finally, we do addition and subtraction from left to right:<br>28 + 12 is 40, and then take away 6, we get 40 - 6 which equals 34.<br><br>So, I think the answer is 34. I hope that's right!<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I remember this from class! When we have a math problem, we have to do the calculations in a certain order or else we might get the wrong answer. First, we have to do what's inside the parentheses, then we do multiplication and division from left to right, and finally, we do addition and subtraction from left to right.<br><br>So let's solve the problem step by step:<br><br>First, let’s do the addition inside the parentheses:<br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now our problem looks like this:<br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, we do the multiplications:<br>4 * 7 = 28<br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>Now our problem looks like this:<br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Now, we can do the addition and subtraction from left to right:<br>28 + 12 = 40<br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So the final answer is:<br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, I think I'd just solve this step by step from left to right because I don't really know about any special rules. So, if I do it in the order I see it:<br><br>First, I'll multiply 4 by something in the parenthesis (because that's kind of like a single thing), so that's 4 times 2 plus 5. Maybe I should add what’s in the parenthesis first, so 2 plus 5 is 7.<br><br>Now I have 4 times 7, which is 28.<br><br>Then I add 12, so it's 28 plus 12, which gives 40.<br><br>And then I subtract 2 times 3. Again, I multiply 2 by 3, which is 6.<br><br>So from 40, I subtract 6, and I get 34.<br><br>So the way I did it, step by step, I get 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Umm, so my teacher told us that when we do a math problem, we have to do some things before others. She said we have to do what's inside parentheses first. So I'm gonna do that!<br><br>First, there are these numbers in the parentheses: (2+5). I add those together because that's what parentheses mean. 2 plus 5 is 7.<br><br>Now the problem looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Then, my teacher said we have to do multiplication before we do addition or subtraction. So I need to multiply 4 times 7, which is 28. And then, multiply 2 times 3, which is 6.<br><br>So it changes to: 28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Now we just do addition and subtraction from left to right. So, I add 28 and 12 first. That's 40. Then I subtract 6 from 40, which is 34.<br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, so I think you just do the things one at a time from left to right. So first, I'll multiply 4 times 3, which is 12. Then I add 2 to that, so 12 plus 2 is 14. <br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: So I'm not sure what PEMDAS is, but I think I know how to solve this. First, we do the multiplication part, because that seems right to do before adding. So we have 4 times 3 which is 12. After that, we add 2 to 12, and that gives us 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I don't know much about special rules, but I think you just go from left to right like reading a book! So first, I would multiply 4 and 3 to get 12, and then I add 2 to that, which makes 14! The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: When we do a math problem, we can't just go from left to right like reading a book. We have to know which parts to do first, like if there's a part that needs to be done before another. So, when we look at 4 * 3 + 2, we have to do the multiplication part first because it's like saying "we have 4 groups of 3 things" before we add anything else to it.<br><br>So first we say 4 groups of 3 things is 4 * 3, which is 12. Now we have 12 things and then we add the 2 extra things we have, so we go 12 + 2 and that makes 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>5+2 * 4</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, so I think you just do the math as you see it from left to right. So first, I'll add 5 plus 2 to get 7, then I'll multiply that by 4 to get 28, because 7 times 4 is 28.<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not really sure what you mean by the "order of operations," but I'll just try to work it out step by step. I think you can either add the 5 and 2 first, or you can multiply 2 by 4 first. Since I don't know the rules, I might first add 5 and 2 to get 7, and then multiply 7 by 4 to get 28. But that might not be right.<br><br>Actually, my friend mentioned something about doing multiplication before addition. So, let's try that: if you multiply 2 by 4 first, you get 8, and then if you add the 5, you get 13.<br><br>Thinking about it, doing the multiplication first seems more correct, so I'll say the answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I don't know much about special rules, but I think you just go from left to right, like reading! So first you do 5 plus 2, which is 7, then you multiply by 4. So 7 times 4... let's see, 4 times 7 is the same as 4 plus 4 plus 4 plus 4 plus 4 plus 4 plus 4. That’s 28! So I think the answer is 28. <br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: When you have a math problem with different things to do like adding and multiplying, you have to do the multiplying part before you add. So first we do 2 times 4 which is 8, and then we add the 5. So it's like this:<br><br>2 * 4 = 8<br>5 + 8 = 13<br><br>So, the answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: I'm not really sure what order to do the operations in, but I know how to add and multiply, so I'll do what seems simple first. I'll just start from left to right.<br><br>So first I'll add 5 + 3, which is 8.<br><br>Then, I'll take that 8 and multiply it by 2, which is 16.<br><br>So if I did that without knowing any special rules, I would say the answer is 16.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I don't know about special rules for calculating, so I'd just add the numbers from left to right because that's how I read! <br><br>First I'd add 5 + 3 which is 8. Then I'd multiply by 2.<br><br>So, 8 times 2 is 16.<br><br>The answer is 16.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: When I do math problems, I like to do them step by step. First I see there's a plus and times sign. So, I will add 5 and 3 together because that comes first when I read from left to right. That makes 8. Then I multiply 8 by 2 because that's the next thing to do. That makes 16. So, I think the answer is 16.<br><br>The answer is 16.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: If I didn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I might just do the operations from left to right as I read them. So, this is how I might solve it:<br><br>First, I'd multiply 7 by 2 to get 14.<br><br>7 * 2 = 14<br><br>Then I'd add that to 8, so now I have:<br><br>14 + 8 = 22<br><br>And then, I'd multiply that result by 5:<br><br>22 * 5 = 110<br><br>Since I didn't know to do the multiplication before the addition, I did the operations in order as they appeared, which isn’t the correct way according to PEMDAS. But as a sixth grader who doesn't know PEMDAS, I'd say:<br>The answer is 110.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Alright, so I'm not sure what this PEMDAS is, but I'll just work from left to right, just like I read. Here goes:<br><br>First, I'll multiply 7 by 2, which gives me 14.<br>Then, I'll add that to 8 multiplied by 5. <br><br>So, 8 times 5 is 40.<br><br>Now I just have to add 14 and 40 together. <br><br>14 plus 40 equals 54.<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: If I don't know about the order of operations, I might just solve this from left to right because that's how I read things!<br><br>So, I would do this step by step:<br><br>First, I would multiply 7 by 2, which is 14.<br>Then I would add 8 to that, which gives me 22.<br>After that, I would multiply 22 by 5.<br><br>Now, let me multiply 22 by 5:<br>22 times 5 is 110.<br><br>So, if I don't know the correct order of operations, I would say:<br><br>The answer is 110.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I only just started learning multiplication, but I know that you have to do the times stuff before you add. So first I'll do 7 times 2. That is 14 because my teacher said to count by sevens two times. Then I have to do 8 times 5, and I know that's 40 because I used my fingers to count by eights five times.<br><br>Now I have 14 and 40, and I have to add them together because that's what comes after the multiplication. So 14 plus 40 is... umm... you add the ones place which is 4 plus 0, that's 4, and then you add the tens place so it's 1 plus 4, which is 5.<br><br>Put them together, and it's 54! <br><br>So, the answer is 54.</td>
