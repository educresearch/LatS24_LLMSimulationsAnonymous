      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think my older sister mentioned something about this. She said that when you see math problems with different things to do like multiplying and adding, you have to do some things before others. So, if I remember correctly, she said we have to do what's inside the brackets first. So let's do that:<br><br>First, we have:<br>2 + 5<br><br>I know that's 7. Then we multiply that by 4 because that's what's outside the bracket:<br>4 * 7<br><br>And 4 times 7 is 28. <br><br>Now, let's look at the rest of the problem:<br>28 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>My sister said we have to do the multiplying before we do the adding or subtracting. So, we have to do 2 times 3 next:<br>2 * 3<br><br>That's 6. Now, we replace that in the problem:<br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Okay, now we just do the adding and subtracting from left to right. So, add 28 and 12 first:<br>28 + 12<br><br>That's 40. And then subtract 6 from that:<br>40 - 6<br><br>And that's 34. <br><br>So, after doing all that, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure about all the rules, but I think you're supposed to do the calculations inside the parentheses first. So, let's do that:<br><br>Inside the parentheses: <br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now we replace the 2 + 5 in the original problem with 7:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Now we need to do the multiplication before the addition and subtraction, I think. So:<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>Now we replace the multiplications in the original problem with the results:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>We just do the addition and subtraction from left to right now:<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So, the final answer is:<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, okay! So I think what I have to do is just go step by step, like adding and multiplying in the order I see it. First, there are numbers in a parenthesis, so maybe I start there. I'll add 2 plus 5. That gives me 7. And there's a multiplication right before that, so I'll multiply 4 times 7. That's 28! <br><br>Next, I see a plus 12, so I'll add that to 28, making 40. Then there is a minus 2, so if I subtract 2 from 40, it gives me 38. But there are still some numbers left! There's a times 3 at the end. Multiplying 2 times 3 gives 6.<br><br>Now, I'm not very sure about what to do next, but I think I might subtract 6 from 38 because it's the last thing I haven't used yet. So, 38 minus 6 is 32.<br><br>The answer is 32.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so first we need to figure out what to do first. My teacher said that when there are plus, minus, times, and parentheses, we should do the stuff in the parentheses first. So let's do that.<br><br>We have 2+5 inside the parentheses, so we add those together because that's what my teacher said to do first. That gives us 7.<br><br>Now we have 4 times whatever is in the parentheses, which we said is 7, so now we have to multiply 4 and 7. That gives us 28.<br><br>After that, we have 12 minus something and 2 times 3 left. Multiplying is like times, so we do that before the minus thing. 2 times 3 is 6.<br><br>So now we have 28 from before plus 12 and then we have to subtract the 6 we just got. So, if we add 28 and 12, we get 40. And then, if we take the 6 away from 40, we have 34 left.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations yet, I might just calculate from left to right as I see the numbers and symbols. So here's how I might do it:<br><br>First, I see 4 times 3, which I know is 12 because 4 groups of 3 are 12.<br><br>Then I see the plus sign and the number 2, so I add 2 to the 12 I just got.<br><br>12 plus 2 is 14.<br><br>So, without knowing PEMDAS, I think the answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I might just calculate from left to right. So I'd do the multiplication first because that's the first thing I see:<br><br>4 * 3 = 12<br><br>Then I add 2 to that:<br><br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I don't really know special rules for the order in which to do stuff in math problems, but I can still try to solve it! So, I think I just go from left to right like reading a book, right? First, I would do the 4 times 3 because that's first, and 4 times 3 is 12. Then, I would add the 2 because that's next. So if I take the 12 and add 2, that gives me 14!<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, so we have to solve 4 times 3 plus 2. I think what we should do first is multiply 4 with 3 because my teacher said that multiplying is like having lots of groups of something, and it's a big deal in math.<br><br>So, let's do that:<br><br>4 groups of 3 is like 3 + 3 + 3 + 3, which is 12.<br><br>Now we have to add the 2.<br><br>12 plus 2 is like having 12 things and then getting 2 more. That makes 14 things!<br><br>So, the answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm a 6th grader just learning about the order of operations, I might think that I should just solve the problem from left to right. However, the correct way to solve this, which I would learn in class, is to do the multiplication part first before doing the addition.<br><br>First, I would multiply 2 by 4, which is 8.<br><br>Then I would take that result and add it to 5.<br><br>So the calculation should look like this:<br><br>5 + 2*4 = 5 + 8 = 13<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I don't really know special rules for the order of doing things, but I might just do the adding first because that's what I see first. So I would do 5 plus 2 which is 7, and then I'd multiply by 4 because that's the next thing I see. <br><br>So 7 times 4 is 28. <br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, so in class we learned that when we have a math problem with adding and times (multiplying), we have to do the times part first before we add. So for 5 plus 2 times 4, we first do 2 times 4.<br><br>2 times 4 is 8.<br><br>Then we take that answer and add it to 5.<br><br>So 5 plus 8 is 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

Doing it this way, my calculation would be:<br><br>First, add 5 + 3 = 8<br>Then, multiply 8 * 2 = 16<br><br>So I would say, The answer is 16.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about order of operations, I might think that I should just calculate this going from left to right because that's how we read. So I would add 5 + 3 to get 8, and then multiply that by 2 to get 16.<br><br>But if I were to guess about how it might work, maybe I'd think we should do the multiplication part first because it seems more complex. So that would mean I would multiply 3*2 to get 6, and then add that to 5 to get 11.<br><br>Since I don't know the rule, I'll provide both possible answers:<br><br>If I just go left to right, the answer might be 16.<br>But if I do the multiplication first, the answer seems like it would be 11.</td>
