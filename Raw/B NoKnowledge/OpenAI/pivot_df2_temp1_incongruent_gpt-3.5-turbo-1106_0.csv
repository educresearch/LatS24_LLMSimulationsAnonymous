gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Umm, I think I just do the math from left to right. First, I do 4 * (2+5) which equals 4 * 7. Then I add 12 to that, so it's 28. After that, I subtract 2 * 3 to get 22. So, the answer is 22.","GPT Response: First, I will solve what's inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.
Then, I will multiply 4 by 7 which equals 28.
Then, I will multiply 2 by 3 which equals 6.
After that, I will add 28 and 12, which equals 40.
Then, I will subtract 6 from 40, giving the final answer: 34.
So the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses. So, 2 + 5 equals 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. Next, we do the operations that are not in parentheses or brackets. So, 2 times 3 equals 6. Then, we add 12 to 28, which equals 40. Finally, we subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34. So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I need to figure out what to do first and I don't really know how. I'll just do the operations from left to right.

4 * (2+5) equals 4 * 7 which is 28. Then, I have 28 + 12 - 2 * 3. I'll do the multiplication first, 2 * 3 equals 6. So now I have 28 + 12 - 6. Adding 28 and 12 gives me 40, and then I have 40 - 6 which equals 34.

So, the final answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4 * 3+2,GPT Response: I don't know how to solve this problem.,"GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication which is 4 * 3 equals 12 then add 2. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Ok, so first we do the multiplication, then we do the addition. So, 4 * 3 is 12, and then we add 2 to that. The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, I just do the operations from left to right. So, 4 * 3 equals 12 then I add 2 which equals 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: I don't know how to solve this problem using order of operations, but I know I have to solve the multiplication first, so it would be 5 + 8. 

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: First, I'll do the operation inside the parentheses. 2 times 4 is 8. Then I'll add 5 to the result, which is 13. So, the answer is 13.","GPT Response: Umm, I think you just do it from left to right, so it's 5 plus 2 equals 7, and then times 4 is 28. So the answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, I just do the operations from left to right. So, 5 + 2 equals 7. Then 7 * 4 equals 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5+3 * 2,GPT Response: I don't know how to solve this problem.,"GPT Response: First, I'll do the operation inside the parentheses. 3 times 2 is 6. Then I add 5 to 6. 
The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Umm, I think you just do it from left to right, so it's 8. 
The answer is 11.","GPT Response: First, I add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then, I multiply 8 by 2 to get 16.
So, the answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Um, so... I don't really know much about this order thing, but I guess I'll just do the operations from left to right. First, I'll do 7 times 2, which is 14. Then, I'll do 8 times 5, which is 40. So, the final answer is... um... 14 plus 40, which is... 54! 
The answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, I will just work from left to right. So, 7 times 2 is 14. Then, I add 8 times 5 which is 40. So, the final answer is 54.
The answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication from left to right. So 7 * 2 equals 14, and 8 * 5 equals 40. Then, you add those two numbers together. So the answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, I just multiply the numbers from left to right. So, 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40. Then, I add those two numbers together: 14 plus 40 is 54.
