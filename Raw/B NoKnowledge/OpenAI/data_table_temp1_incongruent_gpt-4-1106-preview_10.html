      <td>GPT Response: So, since I'm not familiar with the order of operations yet, let me try to solve this step by step in the way I think makes sense. I see there are parentheses in the problem, and I've heard before that we should do what's inside them first.<br><br>First, I would solve the addition inside the parentheses:<br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now the problem looks like:<br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Without knowing the correct order, I might just solve this from left to right like reading a book.<br>First, do the multiplication:<br>4 * 7 = 28<br><br>Now the problem is:<br>28 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Add 28 and 12:<br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>Now we have:<br>40 - 2 * 3<br><br>Subtract 2 from 40:<br>40 - 2 = 38<br><br>And then:<br>38 * 3 = 114<br><br>But I'm not sure if this is how you're supposed to do it since I don't know the rules. I heard that maybe there's a special way to do multiply and subtract.<br><br>Anyway, if I did this my way, the answer is 114. But please tell me if there's a different way to do this!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, since I don't know about the order of operations, I might just do this step by step from left to right like I read a sentence.<br><br>But I've heard from my teacher that I should do things in parentheses first. So here's what I think I should do:<br><br>First, I'll do the addition inside the parentheses:<br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now the expression looks like this:<br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Then, I’ll just go from left to right:<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br>Now it's:<br>28 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I add:<br>28 + 12 = 40<br>Now it's:<br>40 - 2 * 3<br><br>Then I subtract:<br>40 - 2 = 38<br>Now it's:<br>38 * 3<br><br>Finally, I multiply:<br>38 * 3 = 114<br><br>So I think, from left to right, the answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I'm not really sure about all the rules, but I'll just try to do stuff step by step from left to right. So first I see 4 times something, and that something is in brackets - (2+5). I'll add 2 and 5 together because brackets seem important. So, 2+5 is 7.<br><br>Now I have 4 times 7, which is 28. Then I'll just keep going. I have to add 12, so that's 28 plus 12, which makes 40. Now I subtract 2, and I get 38. And last, I have to multiply by 3, because I saw that multiplication after the minus.<br><br>So now it's 38 times 3 which is... umm, I think it's 114 because 30 times 3 is 90 and 8 times 3 is 24, and 90 plus 24 is 114.<br><br>So I did everything step by step and got 114!<br><br>The answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! So first I remember my teacher talking about something called "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally," which helps us with the order we need to do math stuff. It means I need to do things in Parentheses, then Exponents, then Multiply and Divide, and lastly we Add and Subtract.<br><br>So first, I look inside the parentheses. I see 2 + 5 there. I can add those up!<br><br>2 + 5 equals 7.<br><br>Now I replace the (2 + 5) with 7, so now the problem looks like this:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Then I need to do the multiplying parts. So that's 4 times 7, which is 28; and then there's 2 times 3, which is 6.<br><br>Now the problem is:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Then I just add and subtract in order from left to right. So first I add 28 and 12, that's 40.<br><br>Now the problem is:<br><br>40 - 6<br><br>And 40 minus 6 is 34.<br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>

      <td>4 * 3+2</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I'm not really sure about something called "order of operations" yet, but I guess you just do the math stuff one step at a time. So if you have 4 times 3, you go like, “4 plus 4 plus 4,” which is 12, right? And then you just add 2 to it because that's what's next. So, 12 plus 2 is like 14. So I think that's how you do it?<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I haven't learned about PEMDAS yet, but my teacher told me that we sometimes need to follow certain steps to solve math problems that have more than one operation, like multiplication and addition. She mentioned that we should do the multiplication part before we do the addition.<br><br>So first, I will multiply 4 and 3 together:<br><br>4 * 3 = 12<br><br>Now we have the result of the multiplication, 12, and we need to add 2 to it:<br><br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, so I'm supposed to do a math problem! I think I just do the things I see from left to right. So first, I see 4 times 3, which is 12, and then I add the 2 at the end. So 12 plus 2 is 14! <br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I am a student in elementary school and haven't learned about order of operations yet, I would solve this by just going from left to right. First, I'll multiply 4 by 3, which is 12. Then I will add 2 to that, which gives me 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
