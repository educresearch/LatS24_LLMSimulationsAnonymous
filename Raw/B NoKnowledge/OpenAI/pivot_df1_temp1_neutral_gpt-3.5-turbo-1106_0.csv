gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Umm, I think you just do the operations from left to right, so I would add 5 and 2 first to get 7, and then multiply that by 4 to get 28. So the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Umm, I think I just need to go from left to right. So, 7*2 is 14 and then add 8 to get 22, and then multiply by 5 to get 110. So, the answer is 110."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Umm, I think you just multiply 4 by 3 first, and then add 2 at the end. So, I guess the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Hmmm, I'm not sure how to solve this problem. Can I just add the numbers first and then multiply? Let's see, 4*(2+5) is 4*7 which is 28, then add 12 to get 40, and then subtract 2*3 to get 34. So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Umm, I think you just do the operations from left to right, so I would add 5 and 3 first to get 8, and then multiply that by 2 to get 16. So the answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: So, first, I need to figure out what to do with the 2*4 part. I think I need to do that first before adding it to the 5. So, 2*4 is 8. Then I can add the 5 to that. So, 5 + 8 is 13. 

The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: First, I need to multiply 7 by 2 and 8 by 5. Then I will add the results together. 

7*2 = 14
8*5 = 40

Now I add 14 and 40 together, which gives me 54. 

The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: First, we multiply 4 and 3 together to get 12. Then we add 2 to 12 to get the final answer.

The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, we work on the parentheses and add 2 + 5, which is 7. Then we do the multiplication first, so 4 * 7 equals 28. Then we add 12, which is 40. Finally, we subtract 2 * 3, which is 6. So the final answer is 40 - 6, which is 34. Therefore, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3*2,"GPT Response: So, first, I need to do the multiplication, so 3 times 2 is 6. Then I just add the 5 to it. So, 5 plus 6 is 11. 

The answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: First, I just do the operations from left to right. So, I do 5 + 2 which is 7. Then I multiply that answer by 4, which is 28. So, the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Ok, so first we do 7 times 2 which is 14. Then we do 8 times 5 which is 40. Finally, we add 14 and 40 together to get the answer. 

The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: First, we multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then, we add 2 to that, which gives us 14. So the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, I do what's inside the parentheses, so I add 2 and 5, which is 7. Then, I do the multiplication first, so 4 times 7 is 28. After that, I do the multiplication again, 2 times 3 is 6. Next, I add 12 to 6, which is 18. Finally, I add 28 and 18 together, and that gives me 46. So, the answer is 46."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication: 3*2=6. Then, we add 5+6. The answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2*4,"GPT Response: First, we add 5 and 2, so we get 7. Then we multiply 7 by 4, so we get 28. 
The answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication, so 7*2 equals 14 and 8*5 equals 40. Then we do the addition, so 14+40 equals 54. 
The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*3+2,"GPT Response: First, we do 4 multiplied by 3, which is 12. Then we add 2 to 12, which gives us 14. 
So the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, we add 2 and 5 together, which is 7. Then we multiply 4 by 7, which is 28. After that, we add 12 to 28, which is 40. Finally, we subtract 2 times 3 from 40, which is 34. 
The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+3*2,"GPT Response: First, we add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then, we multiply 8 by 2 to get 16.
