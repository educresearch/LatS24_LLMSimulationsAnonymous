      <td>GPT Response: First, we need to simplify the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we have 2+5 which equals 7. Now we have 4*(7)+12-2*3. <br><br>Next, we need to do the multiplication. We have 4*(7) which equals 28, and 2*3 which equals 6. Our expression simplifies to 28+12-6. <br><br>Finally, we can do the addition and subtraction from left to right. We have 28+12 which equals 40, and 40-6 which equals 34. <br><br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to follow the order of operations. First, I solve what's inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5. That equals 7. <br><br>Next, I multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. <br><br>Then, I add 12 to 28, which equals 40. <br><br>After that, I multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. <br><br>Finally, I subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34. <br><br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: So, let's break down the problem step by step. First, we have the expression 4*(2+5). Since we don't know about the order of operations, we can start by just multiplying 4 by the sum of 2 and 5, which equals 28.<br><br>Next, we have +12, so we add 12 to 28, which gives us 40.<br><br>Then, we have -2*3. Since we don't know about the order of operations, we can simply multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6, and then subtract 6 from 40, which gives us 34.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
