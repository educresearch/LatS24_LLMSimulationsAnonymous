      <td>GPT Response: Ok, since I don't know about the order of operations, I'll just solve this one step at a time from left to right.<br><br>First, I see 4 times (2 plus 5). I think I need to go inside the parentheses first. So, 2 plus 5 is 7. Then I do 4 times 7 which gives me 28.<br><br>Now my equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2*3.<br><br>Next, I'll add 28 and 12 which gives me 40. <br><br>Now my equation looks like this: 40 - 2*3.<br><br>Next, I'll subtract. 40 minus 2 equals 38. Wow! <br><br>Now my equation looks like this: 38*3.<br><br>Finally, I'll multiply 38 by 3. This gives me 114. <br><br>The answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know anything about the order of operations, I will just go through the math problem from left to right.<br><br>First, I take 4 times 2, which is 8, then I add 5, which gives me 13.<br><br>Then, I'll add this to 12, which gives me 25.<br><br>Next, I subtract 2, and I get 23.<br><br>And lastly, I multiply by 3 to get 69.<br><br>So, the answer is 69.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I would add 2 + 5 to get 7 because addition is easy. <br>Then, I would multiply 4 with 7, resulting in 28. <br>Next, I have 28 + 12 - 2 * 3. <br>I would do 28 + 12 to get 40, and then I would subtract 2, which is 38.<br>Afterwards, I will multiply 38 by 3 to reach 114.<br><br>The answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I'll add the numbers in the brackets, 2 plus 5 equals 7. Then I multiply 4 by 7 which equals 28. I take this number then add 12 to it, which equals 40. Then I subtract 2 times 3 from that. 2 times 3 equals 6, so I take 6 away from 40 which equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

Then, I add 2 to that 12.<br><br>12 + 2 makes 14. <br><br>So, The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I would multiply 4 and 3 together because they are right next to each other in the equation. So, 4 times 3 equals 12. Then I would add 2 to 12 because it's the last number left. So, 12 plus 2 equals 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
