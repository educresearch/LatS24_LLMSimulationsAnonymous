gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: I'm not quite sure how the order of operations works yet, but I'll try to work this out in the way it seems most logical to me.

First, I'll do the addition since it comes first when I read from left to right: 5 + 2 equals 7.

Then, I'll multiply that result by 4: 7 * 4 equals 28. 

To recap, I added 5 and 2 to get 7, then multiplied 7 by 4 to get 28.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Without knowing the order of operations, I would simply calculate from left to right. First, I'd multiply 7 by 2 to get 14. Then I'd add 8 to get 22. Finally, I'd multiply that by 5 to get 110.

The answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: I would do the operations from left to right because I don't know about the order of operations thing. So, 4*3 is 12, then add 2 and we get 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Since I don't know the order of operations, I would just simplify this from left to right. 

First, I would multiply 4 by 2, which equals 8. Then I'd add this result to 5, that gives me 13.

Then, I would add 12 to this number and get 25. 

Finally, I would subtract 2 times 3, or 6, from 25 to get 19.

The answer is 19."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: I'm not quite sure how the order of operations works, so I'll just calculate this from left to right. 5 plus 3 equals 8, then I'll multiply 8 by 2 which gets 16. 

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would just solve this problem from left to right. So, I would add 5 and 2 together, getting 7, then multiply the result by 4, giving me 28.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: First, I'll multiply 7 by 2 which gives 14. Then, I'll also multiply 8 by 5 which gives 40. Afterwards, I'll just add those two results 14 and 40 which gives us 54. 

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would just solve this problem from left to right. So, I would first multiply 4 and 3, which gives me 12. Then, I would add 2 to that, which results in 14.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Since I don't know PEMDAS, I will do the operation from left to right.

First, I do the multiplication 4*(2+5), which is 4*7. That gives me 28.

Then I add 12 to 28, which gets me 40.

Lastly, I'll subtract 2*3, which is 6, from 40, and get 34.

The answer is 34."

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: As an elementary school student unfamiliar with the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would calculate this problem from left to right. So, I would first add 5 + 2, which equals 7. Then, I would multiply this result by 4. Thus, 7 times 4 equals to 28.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: As a student in elementary school without knowledge of the order of operations, I would just solve the equation from left to right.
