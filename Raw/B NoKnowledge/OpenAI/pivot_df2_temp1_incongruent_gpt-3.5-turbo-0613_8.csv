gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, first, we need to do the calculations inside the parentheses. So, 2+5 equals 7. 

Next, we need to multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. 

Now, we can add 28 and 12, which equals 40. 

Finally, we need to subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which is 6. So, 40 minus 6 equals 34. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we have to solve what is in the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we have 2+5, which equals 7. 

Then we have to multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. 

Next, we have to multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. 

After that, we have to subtract 6 from 12, which equals 6. 

Finally, we have to add 28 and 6, which equals 34. 

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we need to solve what's inside the parentheses. 2 + 5 equals 7.
Then, we do the multiplication inside the parentheses: 4 * 7 equals 28.
Next, we need to do the multiplication outside the parentheses: 2 * 3 equals 6.
Now, we can solve the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 6 equals 34.
So, the final answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to follow the order of operations. First, I need to solve what's inside the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, there is 2 + 5, which equals 7. So, the expression becomes 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, I need to do the multiplication and division from left to right. There are two multiplications: 4 * 7 and 2 * 3. So, I solve those first. 4 * 7 equals 28, and 2 * 3 equals 6. Now, the expression becomes 28 + 12 - 6.

Finally, I need to do the addition and subtraction from left to right. The first operation is addition, so I add 28 + 12, which equals 40. Then, I subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34.

The answer is 34."
