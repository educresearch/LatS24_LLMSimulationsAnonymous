Then, we have 4*(7)+12-2*3.

Next, we need to do the multiplication: 4*7 equals 28 and 2*3 equals 6.

Now we have 28+12-6.

Finally, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28+12 equals 40 and 40-6 equals 34.

So, the answer is 34."

Let's do the addition first. 5+3 equals 8. Now, we have to multiply 8 by 2. So, 8 times 2 is 16. 
Therefore, the answer is 16."
