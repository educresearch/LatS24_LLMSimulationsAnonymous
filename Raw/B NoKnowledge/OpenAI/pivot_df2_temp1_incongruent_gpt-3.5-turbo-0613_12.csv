gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will follow the order of operations. First, I will do the calculations inside the parentheses. 2 + 5 equals 7. Then, I will multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. Next, I will multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. Then, I will subtract 6 from 28, which equals 22. Finally, I will add 12 to 22, which equals 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we need to calculate the sum inside the parentheses: 2+5 = 7

Next, we have to do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28

After that, we add 12 to the result: 28 + 12 = 40

Then, we do the multiplication: 2 * 3 = 6

Finally, we subtract 6 from 40: 40 - 6 = 34

The final answer is 34.","GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about it. First, I should do what's inside the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we have 2+5, which is 7. 

Next, I will do the multiplication. We have 4 multiplied by 7, which gives us 28. 

After that, I will do the addition. We have 28 plus 12, which is 40. 

Then, I will do the subtraction. We have 40 minus 2. This gives us 38. 

Lastly, I will do the final multiplication. We have 2 multiplied by 3, which gives us 6. 

Putting it all together, the answer is 38 minus 6. The answer is 32.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to follow the order of operations. First, I will solve the numbers inside the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, there is 2+5, which equals 7. 

Next, I will solve the multiplication and division from left to right. In this case, there is 4*(7), which equals 28. 

Then, I will solve the addition and subtraction from left to right. I have 28+12-2*3. The multiplication is done before addition and subtraction, so I need to solve 2*3 first, which equals 6. 

Now I have 28+12-6. Next, I can solve the addition, which gives me 40. Finally, I can solve the subtraction, which gives me the final answer of 34.

The answer is 34."
