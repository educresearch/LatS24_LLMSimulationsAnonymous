First, we see there are brackets in the problem, so I think we should solve what's inside them first. Inside the brackets we have:

2 + 5 = 7

Now we replace the bracket with 7:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Then I might just go from left to right, because I don't know about the order of operations yet. So, multiply 4 and 7 first:

4 * 7 = 28

Now our equation looks like this:

28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I'll add 28 and 12:

28 + 12 = 40

That leaves us with:

40 - 2 * 3

Again, going from left to right, we subtract 2 from 40:

40 - 2 = 38

And now we multiply 38 by 3:

38 * 3 = 114

So, with my 6th-grade understanding, I might say:

The answer is 114. 

But this is not the correct way to solve the problem according to the proper order of operations which I would learn later as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction). This would ensure doing multiplication and division before addition and subtraction, unless grouped by parentheses."

Then, I would take that 7 and multiply it by 4 because that's the next thing in the problem.

7 * 4 = 28

So, using this “left to right” method, I would say the answer is 28. But later in school, I’ll learn about something called ""PEMDAS"" or ""order of operations,"" which will teach me the right way to solve it. But for now, I’d say:

The answer is 28."

First, I'll add 2 and 8 because that's easy:
2 + 8 = 10

Then I'll do the multiplication because that's the next thing I see:
7 * 10 = 70
5 * 10 = 50

Finally, I'll add those two numbers together:
70 + 50 = 120

So I think the answer is 120, but I'm not sure if that's right because I don't know the rules for which to do first.

The answer is 120."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Okay, I learned that when we do math problems, we have to do them in a certain order, kind of like when we follow steps in a recipe. My teacher told me about something called ""PEMDAS,"" and it means we do things in this order: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So, let's follow those steps for this problem:

First, we do what's inside the parentheses: (2+5). We add 2 and 5 and we get 7.

4 * (2+5) becomes 4 * 7.

Next, there are no exponents, so we do the multiplication part. 

So, we do 4 * 7, which is 28.

Our equation now looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, we do the multiplication again, because we have 2 * 3 left. That's 6.

So now we have: 28 + 12 - 6.

Finally, we need to do the addition and subtraction, from left to right.

First, we add 28 and 12, which is 40.

Now we have 40 - 6.

And last, we subtract 6 from 40, which gives us 34.

So, the final answer is 34.

The answer is 34."

So, here's what I would do:

First, I take the 5 and add 3 to it because that's the first thing I see. That gives me 8. 
Then, I take the result, which is 8, and multiply it by 2. So 8 times 2 is 16.

So, I would think the answer is 16. 

However, if I knew about the order of operations, I'd know that I have to do the multiplication before the addition. But since I'm pretending not to know that rule, I'll say:

The answer is 16."
