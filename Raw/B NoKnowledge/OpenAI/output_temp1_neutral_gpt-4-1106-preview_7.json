My teacher said that when there are plus, minus, times, and parentheses, we should do the stuff in the parentheses first. So let's do that.\n\nWe have 2+5 inside the parentheses, so we add those together because that's what my teacher said to do first. That gives us 7.\n\nNow we have 4 times whatever is in the parentheses, which we said is 7, so now we have to multiply 4 and 7. That gives us 28.\n\nAfter that, we have 12 minus something and 2 times 3 left. Multiplying is like times, so we do that before the minus thing. 2 times 3 is 6.\n\nSo now we have 28 from before plus 12 and then we have to subtract the 6 we just got.
