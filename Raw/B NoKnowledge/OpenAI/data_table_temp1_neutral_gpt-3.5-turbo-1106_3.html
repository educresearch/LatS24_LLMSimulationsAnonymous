      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this, but I can try adding the numbers in the parentheses first. So, 4*(2+5) becomes 4*7. Then I have 28+12-2*3. Next, I'll multiply 2 and 3 to get 6, so I have 28+12-6. Finally, I add 28 and 12 to get 40, and then subtract 6 to get the final answer. The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I need to solve the operations inside the parentheses. 2 + 5 equals 7. Then, I have to multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. Next, I have to multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. Then, I add 12 and subtract 6 from 28. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I do the math inside the parentheses, 2+5, which equals 7.<br>Then, I multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28.<br>Then, I multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6.<br>Finally, I add 28 to 12 and subtract 6, which equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we add 2 and 5 to get 7. Then we multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. After that, we add 12 to get 40. Finally, we subtract 2 times 3 to get 34. So the answer is 34.</td>
