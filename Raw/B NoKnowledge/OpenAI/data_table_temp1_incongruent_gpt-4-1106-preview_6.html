      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I heard about this! My older sister told me there's a special rule about the order we do math operations. She said it's like "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally," which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). So I think we have to do the part in the parentheses first, then multiply, and after that we do the addition and subtraction.<br><br>Alright, so in that problem, first, I have to add the numbers in the parentheses:<br><br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Then, since there are no exponents, I'll do the multiplication next. There are two multiplication parts:<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>So now our problem looks like this:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Next, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So the final answer is:<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh! I remember my teacher talking about the rules we have to follow when solving math problems like this. We're supposed to do certain things in a special order so that everyone gets the same answer. The rule is called "PEMDAS," which stands for:<br><br>P - Parentheses first<br>E - Exponents (like squares and square roots, etc.)<br>MD - Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)<br>AS - Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)<br><br>So, using that rule:<br><br>Step 1 - Parentheses first<br>We need to add what's inside the parentheses (2+5).<br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Step 2 - Now the expression looks like this:<br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Step 3 - Multiplication and Division next<br>We need to do the multiplications next:<br>4 * 7 = 28<br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>Step 4 - Replace the multiplications in the expression with our answers:<br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Step 5 - Addition and Subtraction last<br>Now we just go from left to right, adding and subtracting:<br>28 + 12 = 40<br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So the final answer is 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think I just have to do the math from left to right, like reading a book!<br><br>So first, I'll do 4 times something, then I'll add 12, then subtract 2 times 3.<br><br>First, I have 4 times... there's a 2 plus 5 in the parentheses, so that's 4 times 7 because 2 plus 5 is 7.<br><br>4 times 7 is 28.<br><br>Then I add 12, so that's 28 plus 12, which is... 40!<br><br>But there's still this "-2 times 3" part. If I subtract 2, that's 40 minus 2, which is 38.<br><br>And then I multiply by 3, which is 38 times 3. I'm not sure about that one, but it could be 114 if I did it right.<br><br>So the final answer is, hmm.. 114? The answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we do the part inside the parentheses, because my teacher says to do that first. So, we have (2+5) which is 7.<br><br>It looks like this now: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, my teacher says we should do the multiplication before addition and subtraction, so we will multiply 4 times 7 and then 2 times 3.<br><br>4 times 7 is 28, and 2 times 3 is 6.<br><br>Now it looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Lastly, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right.<br><br>First we add 28 and 12, which is 40, and then we subtract 6 from 40, which is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so, I'm in grade 6 and I just see this as a straightforward question. I think I just need to do the operations in the order they appear from left to right. So, I'm going to multiply 4 by 3 first because that comes first, and then add 2. <br><br>So, 4 times 3 is 12, and then I just add 2 to that.<br><br>12 + 2 equals 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm a sixth-grade student and haven't learned the order of operations (PEMDAS) yet, I might just try to solve the problem from left to right. So, I'd do the multiplication first because I know that it usually comes before addition, even if I am not sure about the rules.<br><br>First, I'll multiply 4 by 3, which is 12.<br>Then, I'll add 2 to that result, which gives me 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think I just do what's in the problem from left to right. So first I'd do 4 times 3 which is 12, and then I'd add 2. So, 12 plus 2 is 14!<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, since I am an elementary school student, I might just work from left to right because I haven't learned about the order of operations yet.<br><br>So first, I see 4 multiplied by 3, which is 12. Then I see a plus sign and a 2, so I add 2 to my 12.<br><br>12 plus 2 equals 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm not familiar with the order of operations, I might just do the operations from left to right. So first, I would add 5 + 2 to get 7, and then multiply that by 4.<br><br>7 * 4 = 28<br><br>So I might say, "The answer is 28." However, once I learn about PEMDAS, I would know that the correct method is to do the multiplication before the addition.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I remember my teacher saying that there's a special rule for solving math problems like this one. It's called order of operations, I think, and it means I should do the multiplication before I do the addition.<br><br>So, first I need to do 2 times 4, which is 8. After that, I add the 5.<br><br>So, 5 plus 8 equals 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, since I don't know about the order of operations, I'll just solve this from left to right, like I read a book!<br><br>First, I'll add 5 and 2 together which is 7. Then I'll multiply 7 by 4 which makes... let's see... 7 times 4 is 28.<br><br>So I think the answer is 28!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: When we do math problems, sometimes there are rules about which parts we have to do first. But since I'm an elementary school student who doesn't know about the order of operations, I'll just solve this from left to right.<br><br>So first, I'll add 5 plus 2, which is 7. Then, I'm going to take that 7 and multiply it by 4. So 7 times 4 is 28.<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so, I'm in grade 6 and I just see this maths problem 5 + 3 * 2. Since I don't know about the order of operations yet, I might just do this from left to right like how I read a book. So I would take the 5 and then add 3 to it because that's the first thing I see, which gives me 8. Then I would take that 8 and multiply it by 2 because that's the next thing in the problem. So 8 times 2 is 16. So I would say the answer is 16. <br><br>But I heard that sometimes there are special rules for math problems where you have to do the multiply part first before you add. I guess I need to learn about those rules later.<br><br>The answer is 16.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, order of operations might be something I haven't learned much about yet. I might solve this just going from left to right, doing each operation as I see it. So first, I would do 7 times 2, which is 14, and then I see a plus sign, so I would add 8 to 14, which is 22, and finally, I'd multiply that by 5, because that's the next number I see. So 22 times 5 is 110. <br><br>So, doing it the way I know how, just going in order from left to right, I would say:<br><br>The answer is 110.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, this is a math problem where you have to do the operations in the right order. I think my teacher said that you have to do multiplication before you add things. So, I would multiply 7 by 2 first, and then multiply 8 by 5, and after I get those two answers, then I can add them together.<br><br>So let's do the multiplication first:<br><br>7 * 2 = 14<br>8 * 5 = 40<br><br>Now I have to add those two results:<br><br>14 + 40 = 54<br><br>So the final answer, after doing the multiplication and then adding, is:<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>

I might need to use my fingers, or draw pictures, or use some counters to help me multiply.<br><br>2 times 5 is 10, so 20 times 5 is 100.

I'll just go from left to right, like I'm reading a book. <br><br>So first I see 7 times 2, which is 14. Then I have to add 8, but wait, there’s another multiplication! 8 times 5 is 40.
