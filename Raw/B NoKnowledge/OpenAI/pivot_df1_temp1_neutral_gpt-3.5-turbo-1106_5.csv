gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Umm, I'm not really sure how to do this, but I think I just need to do the operations from left to right. So, I'll do 5+2 first, then multiply that answer by 4. 

5 + 2 is 7. 

Now, 7 times 4 is 28. 

So, the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Umm, I think I should just start from the left and go to the right. So, 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40. So, I add 14 and 40 together and get 54. 

The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Umm, I'm not really sure how to do this, but I think I just need to do the multiplication first and then the addition. So, 4 times 3 is 12, and then I add 2 to get 14. 
The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Um, I'm not really sure about the order of operations, but I think I just need to do the operations inside the parentheses first. So, 2+5 is 7, and then I can multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. After that, I need to do the multiplication and division from left to right, so 2*3 is 6. Then I can add 12 to 28, which is 40. Finally, I just need to subtract 6 from 40 to get the final answer.

The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Umm, I'm not really sure how to do this, but I think I just need to do the operations from left to right. So, I'll do 5+3 first, then multiply by 2.

5+3*2 = 8*2 = 16

The answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: First, I just add 5 and 2 together, and then I multiply the sum by 4. 
So, 5 + 2 is 7, then 7*4 is 28. 
The answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Okay, so I have to solve this problem by following the order of operations. First, I have to do the multiplication. So 7*2 is 14 and 8*5 is 40. Then I add the results together. 14 + 40 is 54. So, the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: First, I just multiply 4 and 3 which is 12. Then, I add 2 to 12 which is 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, we do the calculations inside the parentheses: 2+5 = 7.
Then we multiply 4 by 7, which gives us 28.
After that, we do the calculation 2*3 = 6.
Finally, we add 28, 12, and subtract 6 from the sum, which gives us 34.
So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3*2,"GPT Response: First, I just add 5 and 3 together, and then I multiply the sum by 2. 
So, 5 + 3 is 8, then 8*2 is 16. 
The answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Umm, I think you just do it from left to right, so it's 5 + 2 which is 7, and then times 4 which is 28. So the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Okay, so first I'll do the multiplication. 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40. Then I'll add 14 and 40 together. That's 54. So the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Umm, I think you just do it from left to right, so it's 12+2. The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the brackets. So, 2 + 5 = 7. Then, we do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28. Next, we do the multiplication outside the brackets: 2 * 3 = 6. Then we do the addition and subtraction in order from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40 and 40 - 6 = 34. So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Umm, I think you just do it from left to right, so it's 5 + 3 which is 8, and then times 2 which is 16. So the answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2*4,"GPT Response: First, I add 5 and 2 together, which gives me 7. Then I multiply 7 by 4, which equals 28. So the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: First, we do 7 times 2, which equals 14. Then we add 8 times 5, which equals 40. So the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*3+2,"GPT Response: First, I'll do the multiplication, 4*3 = 12. Then, I add 2 to 12, which equals 14.

gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, I just do the operations from left to right. I add 2 and 5 first, then multiply by 4, then add 12, and finally subtract 2 times 3. 

So, first I do 4 * (2 + 5), which equals 4 * 7, which equals 28. 

Then, I add 12 to get 40. 

Finally, I subtract 2 * 3, which equals 6. 

So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+3*2,"GPT Response: First, I add 5 and 3 together, which gives me 8. Then I multiply 8 by 2, which equals 16. So the answer is 16."
