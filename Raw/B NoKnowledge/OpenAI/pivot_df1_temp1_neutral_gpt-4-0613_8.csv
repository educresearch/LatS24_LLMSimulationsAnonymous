gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Knowing nothing about the order of operations, I might just go from left to right. So firstly, I will add together 5 and 2 to get 7. Then, I will multiply 7 by 4 to get a final answer of 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: As a 6th grader who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first multiply 7*2 to get 14. Then I would add the 8 to get 22. After that, I would multiply by 5, to get the final result of 110.

The answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Knowing nothing about the order of operations, I would just solve the problem from left to right! 

First, I would multiply 4 times 3 to get 12. 

Then I would add the 2 to the 12 to get 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations or PEMDAS rule, I would just solve the problem from left to right.

First, I would handle 4*(2+5) which gives 28.
Then, I would add the 12 to the 28 and get 40.
And last, I would subtract 2*3 which equals 6 from the 40 and I get 34.

So, my final answer would be 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about order of operations, I would solve this problem by calculating it from left to right as I read it. 

First, I would add 5 and 3 which equals 8. Then, I would multiply this result by 2 to get the final answer. 

So, 5 + 3 equals 8.
And then, 8 * 2 equals 16.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I'll solve this math problem from left to right just like how we read a sentence. 

First, I will add 5 + 2, which equals 7.

Then, I will multiply that sum (7) by 4. 

7 * 4 equals 28.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: First, I'm going to just go from left to right because I don't know about the order of operations yet. 

So first, I'll multiply 7 and 2 to get 14. 

Then, I'll add 14 and 8 to get 22. 

Finally, I'll multiply 22 and 5 to get 110. 

The answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I'll solve the math problem from left to right just like I read a sentence.

First, I'll handle 4 times 3 which equals 12.
Then, I'll take that answer (12) and add the two (2) to get 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, I will add the numbers inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5 to get 7. Then I will proceed with the multiplication. So 4 times 7 equals 28. After that, I will subtract 2 times 3 equals 6 from the previous answer, so 28 - 6 equals 22. Lastly, I will add 12 to 22, so this equals 34. 

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I'll just solve the problem from left to right. 

First, I'll add 5 and 3 to get 8. After that, I'll multiply 8 by 2, which equals 16. So, I believe the answer is 16.
The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Well, the way I see it is I can simply solve the problem from left to right. So first, I'll add 5 + 2 to get 7. Then, I'll multiply 7 by 4 to get a final answer of 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: First, I would multiply 7 by 2 and get 14. Then, I'd multiply 8 by 5 and get 40. After that, I would add 14 and 40 together to get 54. So, the answer is 54."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: As an elementary school student who hasn't learned about the order of operations (PEMDAS), you'd solve this problem from left to right as you read it. 

You would first take 4 and multiply it by 3, which gives you 12. Then, you would add the 2, making for a total of 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, I can add 2 plus 5, which is 7. Then, I can multiply that 7 by 4 which is 28. After that, I can add the 28 to 12 and get 40. Then I multiply 2 with 3 and get 6. Finally, I would subtract the 6 I got from the 40, which would give me 34. So my solution is:

The answer is 34."

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2*4,"GPT Response: First, I would add 5 and 2, which equals 7. Then I would multiply 7 by 4 to get 28. So, I think the answer is 28. 
The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: First, you have to multiply 7 by 2, which equals 14. Then multiply 8 by 5, which equals 40. Last, you add these two results together, which is 14 plus 40. This equals 54. 

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*3+2,"GPT Response: First, I would multiply 4 and 3 together because I learned in class that I can just multiply numbers in order. This gives me 12. Then I can add 2 to 12, which is 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Sure! So first, I need to add what is inside the parentheses: 2+5 which is equal to 7. 

The equation now looks like: 4*7+12-2*3. 

Next, I'll do 4*7 which equals 28 and the equation looks like this now: 28+12-2*3. 

Then I'll do the multiplication part there which is 2*3 equals 6.

So the equation looks like this: 28+12-6. 

Then I add 28+12 which equals 40. Now the equation looks like 40-6.

Lastly, I subtract 40-6 and that equals 34. 

The answer is 34."
