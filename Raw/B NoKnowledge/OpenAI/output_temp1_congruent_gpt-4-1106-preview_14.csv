Next, I think we need to do the multiplying before adding and subtracting. So I'll multiply 4 times 7 which is 28.

Then we also have 2 times 3 at the end, which is 6.

First, we solve what's inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

Now we replace the result (7) back into the expression:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we do the multiplications:
4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

So now we update our expression with these results:
28 + 12 - 6

We finish by doing the addition and subtraction, from left to right:
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So, I think we first have to do some math inside the brackets! Adding the numbers inside brackets sounds like a good start because we always use brackets to hold things together.

We have 2 plus 5 inside the brackets, so if I add those together, it's like adding two toys plus five toys, which gives us seven toys. So that bit turns into:

4 * 7

Then, there's this plus 12 and minus 2 times 3 left. Hmm, I've seen my older brother do this; we should do the multiplication before the adding and subtracting, cause I heard that's kinda like a rule.

So, I multiply 4 times 7, which is like having 4 groups of 7 things. When I count them all, I get 28. Then, I multiply the 2 times 3 because that's also multiplication, and that gives me 6.

Now it looks like this:

28 + 12 - 6

Adding 28 and 12 is like if I had 28 candies and I got 12 more, that's a lot of candies... Oh right! So I count them up and get 40 candies. Then if I had to give back 6 candies, I would take the 6 away from 40, which leaves me with:

40 - 6 = 34

After that, I add the 2 to the 12, which means 12 plus 2. So, 12 plus 2 is 14! 

So, the answer is 14."

So I'll do 2 plus 5 which is 7. Next, I have to do 4 times that 7, because the times sign is right next to the parentheses, so 4 times 7 is 28.

Now my problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2 times 3. I remember that I should do times before plus and minus. So I do 2 times 3 which is 6. 

Then all I have left is 28 plus 12 minus 6. I'll add 28 and 12 first because they're next to each other and that makes 40. Finally, I take 40 and subtract 6 and that gives me 34.

The answer is 34."
