      <td>GPT Response: First, we need to solve the operations inside parentheses. So, (2+5) equals 7. <br>Then, we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. <br>Next, we add 12 to 28, which equals 40. <br>Finally, we subtract 2*3, which equals 6. <br>So, the answer is 40-6=34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS). The parentheses come first, so we simplify the expression inside the parentheses first, which is 2 + 5 = 7. <br><br>Next, we multiply 4 by the result of the parentheses, which is 4 * 7 = 28. <br><br>Then, we add 28 to 12, giving us 28 + 12 = 40. <br><br>Finally, we subtract the result of 2 * 3, which is 6, from 40. <br><br>Therefore, the answer is 40 - 6 = 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we can add 2 and 5 inside the parentheses, which gives us 7. Then we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. Next, we add 12 to 28, which is 40. Finally, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3 from 40. The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we need to solve what's inside the parentheses: 2+5 equals 7. Now, we have 4*(7)+12-2*3. Next, we need to multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. Now we have 28+12-2*3. Next, we need to multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. Now we have 28+12-6. Finally, we can add 28 and 12, which equals 40, and subtract 6 from that, which equals 34. So the final answer is 34.</td>
