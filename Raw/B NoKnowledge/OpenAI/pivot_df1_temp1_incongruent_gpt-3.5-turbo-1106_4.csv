gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this, but I think we just solve it from left to right. So, I'll add 5 and 2 first to get 7, then multiply that by 4 to get 28. So, the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,7 * 2+8 * 5,GPT Response: I don't know how to solve this problem.
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this, but I think we just do the multiplication first and then the addition. So, I'll do 4 * 3 which is 12, and then add 2 to that, which gives me 14. So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Umm, I'm not really sure how to do this. But I think I should just do the operations one at a time from left to right. So first, I'll do 2+5, which is 7. Then 4 times 7 is 28. After that, I'll do 2 times 3, which is 6. Then I add 12 to 28, which is 40. Finally, I subtract 6 from 40, which is 34. 
The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: I don't really know what to do, but maybe I'll just solve it from left to right. So, 5+3 is 8, and then times 2 is 16. 

The answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: First, I add 5 and 2 together to get 7. Then, I multiply 7 by 4 to get 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: First, I will do the multiplication. So it's 7 * 2 = 14 and 8 * 5 = 40. Then I just add those two results together. So, 14 + 40 = 54. 
The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: First, I do what's on the left, so I multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then I just add 2 to that, which gives me 14. 
The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, we do what's inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 which equals 7. Then, we do the multiplication first: 4 * 7 equals 28. Then, we do the multiplication again: 2 * 3 which equals 6. Then, we add and subtract from left to right: 28 + 12 - 6 equals 34. So, the final answer is 34. Therefore, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: First, I add 5 and 3 together, which gives me 8. Then I multiply 8 by 2, which gives me 16. 

The answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: First, you do the math for 2 * 4 which equals 8. Then you add 5 to that, which equals 13. So the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: First, I will just do the math from left to right without following any order. So, 7 * 2 is 14 and 8 * 5 is 40. Then, I add the results together. 

The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Umm, I think I just do the operations from left to right. So it's 4 times 3 which is 12, then plus 2 is 14. So the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication inside the parentheses. 4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28. Then, you add 28 + 12 = 40. After that, you subtract 2 * 3 = 6. Finally, you subtract 6 from 40 to get the final answer. 

The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: First, you do the math for 3 * 2 which equals 6. Then you add 5 to the answer, so the answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: So first, I do the addition: 5 + 2 = 7. Then I do the multiplication: 7 * 4 = 28. So, the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: First, I just multiply the numbers from left to right. So, 7 times 2 equals 14, and 8 times 5 equals 40. Then, I add the results together. So, 14 plus 40 equals 54. 

The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: So first, I do the multiplication, which is 4 * 3, and that gives me 12. Then I just add 2 to that, and that gives me 14. So the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we add 2 and 5, which equals 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. After that, we subtract 2 times 3, which equals 6. Lastly, we add 12 to get the final answer.
