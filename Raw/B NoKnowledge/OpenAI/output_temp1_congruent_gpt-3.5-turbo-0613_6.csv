Then, I added the result of the multiplication to the ""2"" because the addition symbol is in between them. 
I got 12 from the multiplication 4*3. Then, I added 2 to 12 to get my final answer.
So, the answer is 14."

Then, we multiply 4 by the result, which is 28. 
Next, we add 12 to 28, which gives us 40. 
Lastly, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which is 6, from 40.
