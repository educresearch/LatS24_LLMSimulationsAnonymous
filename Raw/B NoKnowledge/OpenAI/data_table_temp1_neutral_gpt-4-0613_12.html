      <td>GPT Response: To solve this, my instinct is to go left to right. So, first we get the sum of 2 and 5, which is 7. Now, we have 4 times 7, which equates to 28, plus 12. That gives us 40. Last, we subtract the product of 2 and 3, which is 6, from 40 to get 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, let's add the numbers in the bracket, so 2+5 equals 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7, which gives us 28. Afterwards, we add 12 to 28, bringing us to 40. Lastly, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which is 6, from 40. So, we end up with 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I'll just simply add 2 + 5, which equals 7. <br><br>Then, I'll multiply that by 4: 4 * 7 is 28. <br><br>Then, I add 12, which gives me 40.<br><br>Finally, subtract the result from 2*3 which equals 6.<br><br>So, the final answer is 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: First, you should multiply 4 and 3 together because in math, you always do multiplication before addition. So, 4 times 3 equals 12. Then, you add 2 to 12 which gets you 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
