      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I remember my teacher talking about a special rule for solving math problems like this! It's called "PEMDAS," and it stands for:<br><br>- Parentheses (P)<br>- Exponents (E)<br>- Multiplication and Division (MD) from left to right<br>- Addition and Subtraction (AS) from left to right<br><br>So first, I need to solve whatever is in the parentheses.<br><br>4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>That's 2+5 inside the parentheses, which is 7.<br><br>Now it looks like this:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I do the multiplication parts because they come before addition and subtraction in the order of operations.<br><br>4 * 7 is 28, and 2 * 3 is 6.<br><br>So now the problem looks like this:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Okay, now I just have to do the addition and subtraction from left to right.<br><br>28 + 12 is 40.<br><br>Then subtract the 6:<br><br>40 - 6 is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm in 6th grade and am not familiar with the order of operations, I might not solve this correctly. But let's give it a try with what I think might make sense.<br><br>First, we see there are brackets in the problem, so I think we should solve what's inside them first. Inside the brackets we have:<br><br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now we replace the bracket with 7:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Then I might just go from left to right, because I don't know about the order of operations yet. So, multiply 4 and 7 first:<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br><br>Now our equation looks like this:<br><br>28 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I'll add 28 and 12:<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>That leaves us with:<br><br>40 - 2 * 3<br><br>Again, going from left to right, we subtract 2 from 40:<br><br>40 - 2 = 38<br><br>And now we multiply 38 by 3:<br><br>38 * 3 = 114<br><br>So, with my 6th-grade understanding, I might say:<br><br>The answer is 114. <br><br>But this is not the correct way to solve the problem according to the proper order of operations which I would learn later as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction). This would ensure doing multiplication and division before addition and subtraction, unless grouped by parentheses.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: If I don't know about the order of operations, I might just solve the problem from left to right, just like reading a book. Here's how I'd do it without knowing PEMDAS:<br><br>First, I'd start with 4 times 2, which is 8.<br><br>Then I'd add 5 to get 13.<br><br>Next, I'd add 12 to get 25.<br><br>Then, I'd subtract 2 to get 23.<br><br>Finally, I'd multiply by 3 and think that the answer is 69.<br><br>But I remember my teacher saying something about doing what's inside the brackets first, so maybe I should do that part first. Let me try again:<br><br>First, I’d add the numbers in the brackets, which are 2 and 5, and get 7.<br><br>Then I'd multiply 4 by 7 because they are outside the brackets and get 28.<br><br>Next, I'd add 12 to 28 and get 40.<br><br>After that, I'd multiply 2 by 3 and get 6.<br><br>Lastly, I'd subtract 6 from 40 and get 34.<br><br>So even without knowing all the rules, I think the answer might be 34, because I heard that the brackets are important.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, I learned that when we do math problems, we have to do them in a certain order, kind of like when we follow steps in a recipe. My teacher told me about something called "PEMDAS," and it means we do things in this order: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>So, let's follow those steps for this problem:<br><br>First, we do what's inside the parentheses: (2+5). We add 2 and 5 and we get 7.<br><br>4 * (2+5) becomes 4 * 7.<br><br>Next, there are no exponents, so we do the multiplication part. <br><br>So, we do 4 * 7, which is 28.<br><br>Our equation now looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, we do the multiplication again, because we have 2 * 3 left. That's 6.<br><br>So now we have: 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Finally, we need to do the addition and subtraction, from left to right.<br><br>First, we add 28 and 12, which is 40.<br><br>Now we have 40 - 6.<br><br>And last, we subtract 6 from 40, which gives us 34.<br><br>So, the final answer is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>4 * 3+2</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think I've heard my teacher say something about having to do certain parts of math problems before others, but I'm not totally sure how it works. I remember seeing something like you have to do multiplication before you add or subtract. So, if I follow that, I should multiply 4 and 3 first, which is like having 4 groups of 3.<br><br>So, 4 times 3 is 12, right? And then, I think I just need to add 2 to that. So 12 plus 2 is like two more than 12, which is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think I'm supposed to do something in a certain order when I see numbers and symbols like that. If I remember correctly, I have to do the multiplication part before I add. So first I should multiply 4 by 3, which is like adding 4 three times. That's 4 plus 4 plus 4, and that's 12! After that, I have to add the 2 to the 12.<br><br>So 12 (from the multiplication) plus 2 equals 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations yet, I might just solve this from left to right because that's how I read things.<br><br>So first, I would do 4 times 3 which is 12.<br>Then I would add 2 to 12, which gives me 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: When I look at the math problem 4 * 3+2, I think that I should start with the first numbers I see. So I do 4 times 3 which is 12, and then I add 2 to it because that's what comes next. So 12 plus 2 is 14. So I think the answer is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think I'm supposed to do something special when there are different math things like pluses and times in the same problem. My older sibling mentioned that I should always do the times part before the plus part. So, I'll do the 2 times 4 first.<br><br>2 * 4 is 8.<br><br>Now I do the plus part.<br><br>5 + 8 is 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations yet, I might just solve this from left to right, like I read a sentence. So here's what I would do:<br><br>First, I'd add 5 + 2 to get 7.<br>Then, I'd take that 7 and multiply it by 4.<br><br>So now I'll do 7 * 4, which is 28.<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: When I look at the math problem 5 + 2 * 4, since I'm in elementary school and I haven't learned about the order of operations yet, I might just try to solve it from left to right, like reading a book! So, here's what I would do:<br><br>First, I take the 5 and add 2 to it because that's the first thing I see. That makes 7.<br><br>5 + 2 = 7<br><br>Then, I would take that 7 and multiply it by 4 because that's the next thing in the problem.<br><br>7 * 4 = 28<br><br>So, using this “left to right” method, I would say the answer is 28. But later in school, I’ll learn about something called "PEMDAS" or "order of operations," which will teach me the right way to solve it. But for now, I’d say:<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
