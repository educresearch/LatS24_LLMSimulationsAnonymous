      <td>GPT Response: Oh okay, so even though I'm not sure about all these math rules, I remember my teacher talking about something like saying 'Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally' to help us with these kinds of problems. She was talking about parentheses being important. So I'm gonna start with the parentheses first because it feels like they're kind of like a mini math problem inside the bigger one.<br><br>So the part inside the parentheses is 2+5, which is 7.<br><br>Now I have 4 times 7, plus 12, minus 2 times 3.<br><br>I know my multiplication tables pretty well, so 4 times 7 is 28.<br><br>So now my problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2 times 3.<br><br>I need to do the times part next because that's also like a mini math problem. So 2 times 3 is 6.<br><br>Now I just have 28 plus 12 minus 6.<br><br>28 plus 12 is 40, and then 40 minus 6 is 34.<br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I'm in grade 6 and haven't learned about order of operations yet. But here is what I think I should do:<br><br>First, I see some things inside parentheses (2+5), so I've heard that I should do that first. 2 plus 5 equals 7.<br><br>So now I have 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, I think I should do the multiplication parts before adding or subtracting. So 4 times 7 is 28, and 2 times 3 is 6.<br><br>Now the problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Then, I'll just add and subtract from left to right. Adding 28 and 12 gives me 40. Then I subtract 6 from 40, which gives me 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I'm just learning about numbers and stuff, but I think we can just add and multiply and subtract in the order they show up. So first, I see 4 times something, then an addition, then another addition, then a subtraction, and then another multiplication at the end.<br><br>First, we do the 4 times the thing in the brackets which is 2 plus 5. I know that 2 plus 5 is 7. Then we multiply 4 times 7, which gives us 28.<br><br>Next, we just add the 12, so now we have 28 plus 12. That gives us 40 because 28 and 12 make 40.<br><br>Now we subtract 2 times 3. Well, 2 times 3 is 6, so now we take the 40 we had and subtract 6 from it.<br><br>So, 40 minus 6 is 34, and that should be the answer, I think!<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, to solve this, I think we should do the stuff in the parentheses first because my teacher said that's like doing stuff inside a little math house before you can go outside. So first we do:<br><br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Then the problem looks like this:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Now for the rest, I know we have to do the multiplication before we do the adding or the subtracting. So we do the 4 times 7 and the 2 times 3 first!<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>Now the problem looks like this:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>And then we can just add and subtract in order from left to right.<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure what the "order of operations" is, but I think you might do the multiplication before the addition.

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, my older brother showed me this! When adding and multiplying, you have to do the multiplication part first, then you do the adding part. So for 5 + 2 * 4, you do 2 times 4 first, which is 8, and then you add that to 5. So 8 plus 5 equals 13. <br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Since I haven't learned about the order of operations yet, I might try to solve the problem from left to right, just like how I read a book.<br><br>First, I would multiply 7 by 2, which gives me 14.<br><br>Then, I would add that to 8 times 5.

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think you just do the math from left to right, like you read! So, first I'll do 7 times 2, which is 14. Then, I'll add that to 8, so that's 14 plus 8, which is 22. Finally, I'll multiply that by 5. So 22 times 5... hmmm, 2 times 5 is 10, so 22 times 5 should be 110. The answer is 110.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve the math problem 7 times 2 plus 8 times 5, I remember my teacher said to do the multiplication first before the addition. So first, I will multiply 7 by 2 which is 14, and then multiply 8 by 5 which is 40. After that, I add them together to get the final answer. <br><br>So first step:<br>7 * 2 = 14<br>8 * 5 = 40<br><br>Then I add those two results together:<br>14 + 40 = 54<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
