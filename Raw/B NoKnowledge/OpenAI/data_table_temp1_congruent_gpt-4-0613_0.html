      <td>GPT Response: First, I will add the numbers within the brackets, so 2 + 5 = 7. Then, I will multiply 4 with that result, so 4 * 7 = 28. After that, I will subtract 2*3 from 12, so 12 - 6 = 6. Lastly, I will add that number to 28 to get the final result, so 28 + 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I would first go ahead and add the numbers in the bracket together because the equation said that we have to do that first, so that will give me 4*7. <br><br>Then I will do that multiplication operation which equals 28. <br><br>Then, seeing that nothing else can be done to the bracket, I'll move on to the other operations. <br><br>So, I was left with "28 + 12 - 2*3". <br><br>I'd simply add 12 to 28 to give 40 because that's the next operation I see.<br><br>Then subtract 2 from the 40 obtained above which equals 38. <br><br>Lastly, I'd multiply 38 by 3 to get the final answer. <br><br>The answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I'll add 2 + 5, which gives 7. Now the problem looks like 4*7 + 12 - 2*3. <br><br>Next, I'll do the multiplication: so 4*7 gives 28 and 2*3 gives 6. The problem now becomes 28 + 12 - 6. <br><br>Then, I add 28 and 12 together to get 40. The problem becomes 40 - 6.<br><br>Finally, I subtract 6 from 40 and get 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

So, 4 times 3 equals 12. <br><br>Then, I'll add the result, which is 12, to 2 because I see a plus sign next. So, 12 plus 2 equals 14. <br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
