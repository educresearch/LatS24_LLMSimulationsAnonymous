      <td>GPT Response: Oh, okay, I think you do some of the math stuff inside the parentheses first. So I'll add the numbers in the parentheses:<br><br>2 + 5 equals 7.<br><br>Then, you have to do the multiplication before addition and subtraction, right? So I will multiply 4 by the 7 I got from the parentheses:<br><br>4 * 7 equals 28.<br><br>Now, I'll multiply 2 and 3 because multiplication comes before subtraction:<br><br>2 * 3 equals 6.<br><br>So the expression looks like this now:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Next, I just do the addition and then subtraction from left to right:<br><br>28 + 12 equals 40,<br>and then 40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: So to solve the math problem, I think we should do the parts inside the parentheses first because that's what my teacher said is important. So we look at (2 + 5) and add those numbers together because that's the easiest part.<br><br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now that we have this, we can replace (2 + 5) in the problem with 7, so it looks like this:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>So now, we multiply before we do addition or subtraction. That's another thing my teacher mentioned. We do 4 times 7 first:<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br><br>And we also do 2 times 3:<br><br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>Now our math problem looks like this:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Then we can just add and subtract from left to right. So add 28 and 12 first:<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>And then subtract 6 from 40:<br><br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So after doing all that, the final answer is:<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I don't know about any special rules for math steps, but I guess I should start with what seems easiest. I see there's a part with brackets (2 + 5), that looks like something I should do first because it's kind of wrapped up like a present!<br><br>2 plus 5 is 7.<br><br>Then there's this star thingy next to the 4 and the 7, I think that means 4 times 7. I can count by fours: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28. So 4 times 7 is 28.<br><br>There's a plus 12 in the problem, so I'll just add 12 to 28. 28 plus 12 is like 28 plus 10 plus 2, which is 38 plus 2, that's 40.<br><br>Now there's a minus sign and then 2 times 3. I know 2 times 3 is like 2 plus 2 plus 2, which is 6.<br><br>So I take the 40 and need to take away 6. 40 minus 6 is like 40 minus 10 plus 4, which is 30 plus 4, and that's 34.<br><br>So, if I just look at each part and do the math that I know how to do, I get:<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so we have a math problem: 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3. <br><br>My teacher said we have to do the math in a special order so that everyone gets the same answer. She called it "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally" or something. It means we do Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>So first, I'll do what's in the parentheses, because it's like a mini-math problem that you solve first.<br><br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now the problem looks like this:<br><br>4*7 + 12 - 2*3<br><br>Then I'll do the multiplication because that's next. So I have to times stuff before I plus or minus.<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>So now we have:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Next, we just do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So let's add first:<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>And then we subtract:<br><br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So the final answer is 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>4*3 + 2</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about order of operations yet, I might just do the operations from left to right as I see them. So, I would first multiply 4 by 3, because that's the first thing I see, and that gives me 12. Then I would add 2 to that result, because that comes next.<br><br>4 * 3 = 12<br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, even though I don't know the order of operations officially, I can still try to solve this using common sense. So I would first do the multiplication part because it seems like if you have 4 groups of 3 things, you would get that total first. So, 4 times 3 is 12. Then, I would add the 2 to it, because now I have 12 things and I'm adding 2 more things to it. So, 12 plus 2 is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm just learning about adding and multiplying, so I think I would do this by just solving it from left to right like I read a book.<br><br>First I would multiply 4 and 3 because that comes first in the problem. So, that's 4 times 3 which is 12.<br><br>Then I see there is a plus sign and a 2, so I add the 2 to the 12. So, 12 plus 2 is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Um, so I think I just do the math step by step from left to right. First, I do 4 times 3 which is 12, and then I add 2. So after I do the multiplication, 12 plus 2 is 14. So, yeah, I think that's it.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>5 + 2*4</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Umm, I'm not sure what you mean by 'order of operations', but when I look at this, I think I should probably do the multiplication part first because I remember hearing once that there's some rule about doing multiplying before adding. So, if I do 2 times 4, that gives me 8.<br><br>Then if I add 5 to that, so 5 plus 8, I get 13!<br><br>So, I think the answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: In math, we have a special rule that helps us figure out which parts of a problem to do first. This rule is called "PEMDAS" which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>Looking at the problem 5 + 2*4, there aren't any parentheses or exponents, so we look at multiplication and division next. We do the multiplication part first before we do the addition.<br><br>So first we multiply:<br>2 * 4 = 8<br><br>Then we add that result to 5:<br>5 + 8 = 13<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I'm going to just do this the way it makes sense to me since I haven't learned about any special rules yet. I'll add 5 and 2 first because they are the first numbers in the problem. So, that's 7. Then I'll multiply 7 by 4 because that's the next thing to do. Then 7 times 4 is 28!<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Um, so I think we just do the adding and the multiplying in the order it's written. So first we go 5 + 2 which is 7, and then it says to multiply by 4, so we do 7 * 4 which is 28! <br><br>The answer is 28.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about order of operations yet, I might just do the operations from left to right as I see them. So, I would add 5 + 3 to get 8, and then multiply that result by 2. So my calculation would be:<br><br>5 + 3 = 8<br>8 * 2 = 16<br><br>So, I might think the answer is 16.<br><br>The answer is 16.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, even though I don't know the order of operations named PEMDAS, it makes sense to me to first do the multiplication part because it's like saying "I have 3 groups of 2" which seems like one thing to figure out first. So, if I multiply 3 times 2, I get 6. Then, I can take that 6 and add it to the 5.<br><br>So if I add 5 and 6 together, I get 11. Therefore, the answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I'm going to just do this the way it makes sense to me since I haven't learned about any special rules yet. I'll add 5 and 3 first because they are the first numbers in the problem. So, that's 8. Then I'll multiply by 2 because that's the next thing to do.<br><br>So, 8 times 2 is 16.<br><br>The answer is 16.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Um, so I think I just do the adding and multiplying in the order they appear. So first I do 5 plus 3 which is 8, and then I take that 8 and multiply it by 2, which is 16. So I think the answer is 16! <br><br>The answer is 16.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I haven't learned about the order of operations in school yet, but I think we have to figure out what to do first. When I look at the problem, I see some multiplication and addition. My big sister told me once that multiplication is like adding the same number over and over, so maybe that comes before the regular addition?<br><br>So if I do the multiplication parts first:<br>7 times 2 is 14, because 7 plus 7 is 14.<br>Then 8 times 5 is 40, because 8 added together 5 times is 40.<br><br>Now, I just need to add those two results together:<br>14 (from the 7 times 2) plus 40 (from the 8 times 5) equals 54.<br><br>So, I'm thinking without knowing the official rules, the result might be:<br>The answer is 54.</td>
