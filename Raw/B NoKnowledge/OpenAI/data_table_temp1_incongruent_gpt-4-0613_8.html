      <td>GPT Response: First, I will add the numbers that are in the parentheses, which are 2+5. So, that's 7. <br><br>Next, I see the multiplication sign before the parentheses, so I will multiply 4 by the result we got from the parentheses earlier, which is 7. 4 multiplied by 7 equals 28.<br><br>Then, I see there's a plus sign before the number 12, so I will add 28 with 12. That gives me 40. <br><br>After that, I subtract 2 from 40. That's 38. <br><br>Finally, I see another multiplication, which is 2 * 3, which equals 6. I subtract 6 from 38. That gives me 32.<br><br>So, the answer is 32.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, let's add the numbers inside the brackets. This gives us:<br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Then we can do the multiplication next:<br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>And finally, let's do the addition and the subtraction, in that order.<br>This leads us to:<br>40 - 6<br><br>So the final answer is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I'll add 2 and 5 because they are in parenthesis. So, 2 + 5 equals 7. Then, I'll do 4 times 7 (which is 28) because it's next to the parenthesis. After, I'll add 12 to 28 and this equals 40. Then I'll multiply 2 and 3 to get 6. Finally, I'll subtract 6 from 40!<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I'm going to add what's inside the parentheses because it's surrounded by these things ( ), so 2+5 equals 7. Next, I'm going to multiply that 7 by the 4 outside the parentheses to get 28. <br><br>Then I'll add the 12 to the 28 to get 40. After that, I'm going to multiply the 2 and 3 together to get 6. Finally, I subtract the 6 from 40 to get the final answer of 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
