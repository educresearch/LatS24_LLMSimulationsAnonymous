gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: I don't know what order of operations is, but I think you just solve it from left to right. So, I'll add 5 and 2 first, and then multiply the result by 4. So it's 7*4. The answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: I will just do the operations from left to right without worrying about the order. 
7*2 = 14
14+8 = 22
22*5 = 110
So, the answer is 110."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: I don't know what order of operations is, but I think you just do the operations from left to right. So, 4*3 is 12, and then 12+2 is 14. So the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Um, I think I should just do the operations from left to right. So, first I'll add 2 and 5 to get 7. Then, I'll multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. After that, I'll add 12 to get 40. And finally, I'll subtract 2*3 to get 34. So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: I don't know what order of operations is, but I'll just solve the problem from left to right. So, I'll add 5 and 3 first, and then multiply the sum by 2. 

5 + 3 = 8
8 * 2 = 16

So, the answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: First, I add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then, I multiply 7 by 4 to get 28. 
The answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: First, I multiply 7 and 2 to get 14, then I multiply 8 and 5 to get 40. After that, I add the results together which is 14 + 40 = 54. 
The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: First, I do the multiplication 4*3, which is 12, then I add 2. So the answer is 14. 
The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, I do the operations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7. Then, I do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28. After that, I do the multiplication: 2 * 3 = 6. 

Next, I do the addition and subtraction in order from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40, and 40 - 6 = 34.

So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3*2,"GPT Response: First, I add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then, I multiply 8 by 2 to get 16.

gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: First, I will do the multiplication: 2 * 4 = 8.
Then, I will do the addition: 5 + 8 = 13.
The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication! So, 7*2 is 14 and 8*5 is 40. Then you add the results together. 
The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: I would do the multiplication first, so 4 * 3 = 12. Then I would add 2, so 12 + 2 = 14. 
The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, you do the stuff in the parentheses. That's 2+5, which is 7. Then you do the multiplication first: 4*7 is 28. Then you do the 2*3, which is 6. Then you add 12 to 28 and subtract 6. The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: First, I will do 5+3, which is 8. Then, I will multiply that by 2, which is 16. 
The answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2*4,"GPT Response: First, I do the multiplication, so 2 times 4 is 8. Then I add 5 to 8, and that gives me 13.

The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication. So, 7*2 is 14 and 8*5 is 40. Then you add those two numbers together. 
So, 14 + 40 is 54. 
The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*3+2,"GPT Response: First, I just need to do the multiplication first, so 4*3=12. Then I just add 2 to get the final answer. 

The answer is 14."
