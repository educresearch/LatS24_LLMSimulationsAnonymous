gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: I just add the numbers from left to right. So, 5 + 2 is 7, and then 7 * 4 is 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Umm, I'm not sure how to solve this, but I think I just have to do the operations from left to right. So, I'll do 7*2 first, which is 14, and then I'll do 8*5, which is 40. So the answer is 14 + 40, which is 54. 
The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,GPT Response: I don't know what to do because I haven't learned about order of operations yet. Can you help me? The answer is 14.
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: I don't know anything about order of operations, but I think I should just do the calculations from left to right. So first, I'll do 4*(2 + 5) which is 28. Then I'll add 12 which is 40. Then I'll subtract 6 which is 34. So the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: I just add the 5 and 3 first, then multiply the result by 2. 

The answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication, so 2*4 equals 8. Then we add 5 to 8, which equals 13. 
So the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: First, I do the multiplication of 7 and 2 which is 14. Then, I do the multiplication of 8 and 5 which is 40. Then, I add 14 and 40 together to get 54. 

The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, I do the multiplication which is 4*3 and that gives me 12. Then I add 2 to 12 and that gives me 14. So the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, I'll just do the operations from left to right. So, 4 times (2 + 5) is 28, then plus 12 is 40, then minus 2 times 3 is 34. The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: I just add 5 and 3 first, then I multiply the sum by 2. 
(5 + 3) * 2 = 8 * 2 = 16
The answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication, so you do 2*4 first, which equals 8. Then, you add 5 to 8. 

The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Um, I think you just do the math from left to right. So it's like 7 times 2 is 14, and then 8 times 5 is 40. So the final answer is 14 plus 40, which is 54. So the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication, so you do 4*3, which equals 12. Then you add 2 to that, which equals 14. So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Ok, so first I will do the operations inside the parentheses. 2 + 5 is 7. Then I will multiply 4 by 7, which is 28. Then I will do the operations with the numbers outside the parentheses. 28 + 12 is 40. Then I will multiply 2 by 3, which is 6. Finally, I will subtract 6 from 40, which is 34. 
The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication, so you do 3*2, which equals 6. Then you add 5 to that, so it's 5 + 6. The answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: First, I see the numbers 5 and 2. Then I see the operation *, which means multiplication. So I do the multiplication first, which is 2*4, and that equals 8. Then I add 5 to 8, which equals 13. So the final answer is 13. Therefore, the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: First, you just multiply the numbers from left to right. So, 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40. Then you add those two numbers together, which is 54.
So, the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, I see the numbers 4, 3, and 2. Then I remember that we do multiplication before addition. So, 4 times 3 is 12. Then we add 2. So the answer is 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. After that, we do the operations in the order they appear from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40. Then, we do 2 * 3 = 6. Finally, we do 40 - 6 = 34. So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: First, I see the numbers 5 and 3. Then I see the operation *, which means multiplication. So I do the multiplication first: 3*2 = 6. Then I add 5 to 6. So, 5 + 3*2 = 5 + 6 = 11. 
The answer is 11."
