      <td>GPT Response: First, let's add 2+5 inside the parenthesis, so we get 4 * 7+12 -2 * 3. Then, we multiply 4 * 7 to get 28 and we also do 2 * 3 to get 6. So we get 28 + 12 - 6. Next, we add 28 and 12 to get 40 and then subtract 6 from 40. That gives us 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: As an elementary student who doesn't know about order of operations, I would solve the problem from left to right just like how I read a sentence. So first, I would multiply 4 and 3 together because they're the first two numbers, and that gives me 12. Then, I would add 2 to 12 because that's the next step. So, 12 plus 2 equals 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: So first, I do the multiplication part. That's 4 times 3, which gives me 12. Then, I add the 2 to that. That gives me a total of 14. <br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
