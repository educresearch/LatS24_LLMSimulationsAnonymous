      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, first, we need to simplify within the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we have 2+5 which equals 7. <br><br>Then, we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28.<br><br>Next, we add 12 to 28, which equals 40.<br><br>After that, we multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6.<br><br>Finally, we subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I start by looking for any parentheses. I see that there is a set of parentheses in the expression (2+5). Inside the parentheses, I add 2 and 5, which equals 7. <br>Next, I multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. <br>Then, I go to the next operation, which is addition. I see that I need to add 28 and 12, which equals 40. <br>After that, I move to the subtraction operation. Subtracting 2 multiplied by 3, I get 6. <br>Finally, I subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34. <br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we should solve the parentheses. We have 2+5 which equals 7. So, we now have 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. <br><br>Next, we should multiply. We have 4 * 7 which equals 28 and 2 * 3 which equals 6. So, our expression becomes 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Lastly, we should add and subtract from left to right. We have 28 + 12 which equals 40, and then 40 - 6 which equals 34. <br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we need to solve what's inside the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, there is 2+5 which equals 7. <br><br>Next, we need to solve the multiplication. There are two multiplications: 4 times 7 equals 28 and 2 times 3 equals 6.<br><br>Then, we add the numbers. We have 28 plus 12 minus 6.<br><br>Finally, we subtract 6 from 28 and we get the final answer. <br><br>The answer is 22.</td>
