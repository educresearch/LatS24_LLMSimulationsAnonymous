      <td>GPT Response: Umm, I'm not really sure. I think I'll just try to solve it left to right. So first, I'll do 4 times 7 which is 28. Then, I'll add 12 to get 40. After that, I'll do 2 times 3 which is 6. And finally, I'll subtract 6 from 40 to get 34. <br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I will solve the operations inside the parentheses. So, 2 + 5 equals 7. Then I will do the multiplication first because it comes before addition. So, 4 * 7 equals 28. Then I will do the multiplication of 2 * 3, which is 6. Finally, I will do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So, 28 + 12 equals 40, and then 40 - 6 equals 34. <br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses. 2+5 equals 7. Then we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. Then we do the multiplication between 2 and 3, which equals 6. Then we add 28 and 12, which equals 40. Finally, we subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34. So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we do what's inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5, giving us 7. Then we do what's outside the parentheses, which is 4 times 7, giving us 28. Then we do the multiplication and subtraction, going from left to right, so 28 + 12 - 2 times 3 becomes 40 - 6, which is 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
