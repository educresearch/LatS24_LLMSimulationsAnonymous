      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS). <br>1. First, we need to solve inside the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5, which equals 7.<br>2. Next, we need to do the multiplication. We have 4 * 7, which equals 28.<br>3. Then, we can add the remaining numbers. We have 28 + 12, which equals 40.<br>4. Finally, we need to do the subtraction. We have 40 - 2 * 3. We need to do the multiplication first, so we have 2 * 3, which equals 6. Then, we can subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I'll follow the order of operations (PEMDAS). First, I'll solve the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7. <br>Then, I'll multiply 4 by the sum we just found: 4 * 7 = 28.<br>Next, I'll simplify the multiplication: 2 * 3 = 6.<br>Now, I'll solve the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40, and 40 - 6 = 34.<br>So, the final answer is 34.</td>
