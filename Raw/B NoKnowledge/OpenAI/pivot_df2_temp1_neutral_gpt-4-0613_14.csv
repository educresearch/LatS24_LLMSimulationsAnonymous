gpt-4-0613,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: As a sixth grader who has not learned the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would likely solve from left to right. Here's how I would do it:

First, I would see the operation 4*(2+5) and I would add 2+5 to get 7. 
Then multiply 4*7 to get 28. 

Then I would add 28 + 12 to get 40. 

Lastly, I would read the rest of the problem and subtract 2 * 3 from 40 to get 34 because I think we need to subtract 2 first and then multiply by 3.

So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: Okay, so my teacher hasn't taught me about the order of operations, but I'll try my best. So, I guess I can just take it from left to right. So, first I'll add 2 and 5 which is 7. Now I have 4*7+12-2*3. Then we multiply the 4 and 7 which gives me 28. The equation is now 28+12-2*3.

Then we do the addition and get 40-2*3. Subtracting next gives us 38*3. When we multiply that, I get 114.

So I think, the answer is 114.","GPT Response: First, I will add 2 and 5 which gives 7. Next, I will multiply 4 and 7 to get 28. After that, I'll add 28 and 12 to get 40. Finally, I will subtract the product of 2 and 3, which is 6, from 40 to get 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, add 2 and 5 to get 7. Then, I will multiply 4 with 7 to get 28. After that, I will subtract 2 times 3 which is 6 from 12. This gives me 6. Finally, I will add 28 from the result of the multiplication between 4 and the addition of 2 and 5, to the number 6 to get 34.
The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would just solve the problem from left to right. 

First, I would multiply 4 by 3, which gives 12. 
Then, I would add the 2 to the 12, which results in the final answer of 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, I will multiply 4 by 3, which equals 12. Then, I'll add 2 to that. So, 12 plus 2 is 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Since I do not know about the order of operations, I would just solve the problem from left to right.
First, I would calculate 4*3 which is 12. Next, I would add 2 to 12 which gives me 14.
So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: So, I think you just solve it from left to right, like reading my favorite book. So, I will multiply 4 and 3 first, which gives me 12. Then, I will add 2 to this and get 14.

First, I would add 5+2 and get 7. 

Then, I would multiply 7 by 4 and get 28. 

So, the answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then, I will multiply 7 by 4 to get 28. So, the answer is 28.","GPT Response: Since I do not know about the order of operations, I would just calculate the equation from left to right.
First, I would add 5 and 2, which is 7.
Then I would multiply 7 by 4, which is 28. 

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: So, I think you just go from left to right like when you're reading, right? So you do the 5 + 2 first which gives you 7. Then you multiply 7 times 4 to get 28. So, I think the answer is 28. 

The answer is 28."
