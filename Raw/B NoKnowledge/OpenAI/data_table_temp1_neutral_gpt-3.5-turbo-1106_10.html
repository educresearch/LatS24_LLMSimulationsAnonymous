      <td>GPT Response: First, we add 2 and 5 together to get 7. Then we multiply 4 by 7 which is 28. Then we add 12 to get 40. Then we multiply 2 by 3 to get 6. Finally, we subtract 6 from 40 to get the answer of 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, you solve what's in the parentheses. 2 + 5 is 7. Then, you multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. After that, you multiply 2 by 3 to get 6. Next, you add 12 to 28 to get 40. Finally, you subtract 6 from 40 to get the final answer. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we can do the operations inside the parentheses. 2 + 5 equals 7. Then we just follow the order from left to right. 4 times 7 is 28. Then we add 28 and 12 to get 40. Then we subtract 2 times 3 from that, which is 6. So the final answer is 34. <br>The answer is 34.</td>
