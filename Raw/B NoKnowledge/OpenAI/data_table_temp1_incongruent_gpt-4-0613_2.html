      <td>GPT Response: First, I'll do the operation in the brackets, which is 2+5. That gives me 7. <br><br>So now our equation is 4 * 7 +12-2 * 3. <br><br>Next, I'll multiply 4 and 7 to get 28. <br><br>So now we have 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>After that, I'll add 28 with 12 to get 40.<br><br>So now our equation is 40 - 2 * 3.<br> <br>Finally, I'll subtract 2 times 3 from 40 which is 6. <br><br>So the final calculation is 40 - 6<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I'll add the numbers in the parenthesis. So, 2 + 5 equals 7. Next, I'll multiply 4 with the resulting 7, which equals 28. Now, I'll add the 28 to 12 which equals 40. And, then I'll subtract 2 * 3 from the 40. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I would add 2 and 5 because they're inside the brackets. That would give me 7. Then, I would multiply the 4 and the 7 because multiplication is just repeated addition. That would give me 28. After that, I would add the 12 because it's there after the plus. That would give me 40. At last, I would subtract 2 times 3 (which is 6) from 40 because subtraction is the opposite of addition. That would give me 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so here's what I would do. First, we do the multiplication. So, 4 times 2 is 8, and 2 times 3 is 6. Then, we add 5 to our first result to get 13. After that, we add 12 to get 25 and then subtract 6 to get 19. <br><br>The answer is 19.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: First, I would multiply 4 with 3 because multiplication goes before addition to me. That will give me 12. After that I would add the 2. So 12 plus 2 is 14. So, I think the answer is 14. The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I will do the multiplication because we're usually told to do multiplication before addition. So, 4 times 3 equals 12. Then, I will add the 2 to the 12 which makes 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
