gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,GPT Response: I don't know how to do this.,"GPT Response: I just add and multiply from left to right. First, I do 4 * (2 + 5), then I add 12, and lastly, I subtract 2 * 3. So, it becomes 4 * 7 + 12 - 6. Then I do the multiplication first, 4 * 7 is 28. Then I do the addition, which makes it 28 + 12 - 6. Lastly, I do the subtraction, which is 40 - 6. So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, you do the stuff inside the parentheses. So, 2 + 5 is 7. Then, you do the multiplication, so 4 times 7 is 28. After that, you add 12 to 28, which is 40. Finally, you do the subtraction, which makes the answer 34. 
So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I solve what's inside the parentheses. 2 + 5 is 7. Then, I do the multiplication first so 4 * 7 is 28. Then, I do the next multiplication which is 2 * 3 which is 6. Then I add 12 to 28 which is 40. Finally, I subtract 6 from 40 which is 34. So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Umm, I'm not really sure, but I think you just do the multiplication first, and then the addition. So, 4 times 3 is 12, and then you add 2. So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, I will do the multiplication which is 4*3 = 12. Then I will add 2 to 12. So, 12 + 2 = 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Ummm, I think I just have to do the multiplication first and then the addition. So, 4*3 is 12. Then I add 2, and that's 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, I just do the operations from left to right. So, 4x3 equals 12. Then, I add 2 to 12, which equals 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Umm, I'm not really sure, but I think you just do the operations from left to right. So, you add 5 and 2 to get 7, and then multiply that by 4 to get 28. 
The answer is 28.","GPT Response: To solve the problem, I just need to do the operations from left to right. 

5 + 2*4 
= 5 + 8 
= 13 

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: Ummm, I think we just do the operations from left to right, so it's 5 + 8, which is 13. So, the answer is 13.","GPT Response: So, in this problem, we start by doing the multiplication first. It's 2 times 4, which equals 8. Then we just add 5 to 8. And that gives us 13. So, the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Umm, I'm not really sure, but I think you just do the operations from left to right. So, you would do 5 + 3 first and then multiply by 2. 

5 + 3*2 = 8*2 = 16.

So, I think the answer is ""The answer is 16.""","GPT Response: To solve the problem, I just need to do the operations from left to right. 

5 + 3*2 
= 5 + 6 
= 11

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Ummm, I think we just do the math from left to right, so it's 5 + 3, which is 8, and then times 2, which is 16. So the answer is 16.","GPT Response: So, in this problem, we have to do the multiplication first before the addition. So we do 3 * 2 which is 6, then we add the 5. And, the answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Umm, I think I just multiply from left to right. So, 7*2 is 14 and 8*5 is 40. Then I add them together, so the answer is 54.","GPT Response: So first, I just do the multiplications in order from left to right. 7*2 is 14, and then 8*5 is 40. So, I add 14 and 40 together and get 54. 

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Um, I just do the math from left to right. So, 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40. Then I add those together, which is 54. So, the answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, we multiply 7 by 2 to get 14. Then we multiply 8 by 5 to get 40. Finally, we add the two products together to get the final answer. 

The answer is 54."
