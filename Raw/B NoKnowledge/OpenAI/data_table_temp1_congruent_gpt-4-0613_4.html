      <td>GPT Response: First, since we're dealing with multiplication, addition, and subtraction here, I will simply perform all operations from left to right, like reading a book! <br><br>Let's start with 4*(2 + 5)= 4*7 =28, so the problem simplifies to 28+12-2*3. <br><br>Then, performing the addition, 28+12=40, which further simplifies the problem to 40-2*3. <br><br>Lastly, we can subtract and multiply from left to right as well: 40-2 gives 38, then multiplying by 3 equals 114.<br><br>The answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will just solve this problem from left to right.<br><br>First, calculating 4*(2+5), I add 2 and 5 to get 7, and then multiply that by 4 to get 28. <br><br>Then, 28 + 12 equals 40.<br><br>Finally, for 40 - 2*3, I subtract 2 from 40 to get 38 and then multiply that by 3 to get 114.<br><br>The answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I see an addition inside the brackets (2 + 5), so I will add them together because it seems like that's what you always do first with expressions inside the brackets. That gives me 7.<br><br>Then, I'm going to multiply 4 by 7 because multiplication is always more important than addition or subtraction in some way. That gives me 28.<br><br>Now, I will add the next number, 12, to 28. I'm sure addition is like the next operation to handle after multiplication. That gives me 40.<br><br>Finally, I multiply 2 by 3 to get 6 and subtract it from 40 because subtraction comes after the stuff we did before. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I will do the multiplication and addition inside the brackets which is 2 plus 5 which equals 7. Then, I will multiply 4 with 7 which is 28. After that, I add 12 to 28 which equals 40. Lastly, I subtract 2 times 3 which is 6 from 40. 40 minus 6 equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Since I haven't learned about the order of operations yet, I'll just solve the question from left to right. First, I'll multiply 4 * 3 which equals 12. Then, I'll add the 2. <br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about PEMDAS, I would solve the problem from left to right.<br><br>First, I will multiply 4 and 3, which gives me 12. Then, I'll add 2 to the result which is 12 + 2 equals 14. <br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I'll add the numbers 3 and 2 together because they are the smallest which makes it 5. Then, I'll multiply 4 * 5 which equals 20.<br><br>The answer is 20.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: So first, I would multiply 4 by 3 which gives 12. Then, I would add 2 to 12. That would give me 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about PEMDAS or the order of operations, I'll just solve the math problem from left to right. <br><br>First, I'll add 5 and 2 together, which equals 7.<br><br>Next, I'll multiply the result (7) by 4, which equals 28. <br><br>So, 5 + 2 * 4 = 28 for me. <br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As an elementary student who doesn't know about order of operations, I would solve the problem from left to right just like how I read a sentence. So first, I would add 5 and 2 together to get 7. Then, I would multiply 7 by 4 to get 28. <br>So, for me, the answer to 5 + 2*4 is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: So, with the way I think about it right now, we would just do everything in order from left to right, just like how we read. <br><br>First, we add 5 + 2 which equals 7. Then, we multiply 7 by 4 because that's what's left and we get 28.<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so let's start with the plus sign. It's asking us to add 5 and 3, which makes 8. Then it says to multiply that with 2. So, 8 times 2 is 16.<br><br>The answer is 16.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: So, with this one, I think you should do the addition first because it's written first, right? So, 5+3 is 8 and then you multiply that by 2 and get 16.<br><br>The answer is 16.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: First, I will calculate the multiplication parts. So, 7 times 2 is 14 and 8 times 5 is 40. So, the equation becomes 14 + 40. If I add them together, I get 54.<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
