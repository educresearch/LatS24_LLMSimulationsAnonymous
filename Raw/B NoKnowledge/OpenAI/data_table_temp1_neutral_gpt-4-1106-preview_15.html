      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I might think that I should solve the math problem from left to right just like I read a sentence.<br><br>So, here is what I might do:<br><br>First, I would multiply 4 by 2 because that's the first operation I see.<br>4 * 2 = 8<br><br>Then I would add 5 to that result:<br>8 + 5 = 13<br><br>Next, I would add 12 to that result:<br>13 + 12 = 25<br><br>And finally, I would subtract 2 times 3 from that result:<br>25 - 2 * 3 = 25 - 6 = 19<br><br>So I would say, the answer is 19. However, I should note that when you learn the correct order of operations, you'll find out that this is not the right way to solve the problem, but since I don't know PEMDAS, this is what makes sense to me for now.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm just learning about order of operations, I'll try to follow what I think makes sense.<br><br>First, I see some parentheses which I think we're supposed to do first. So I'll start with that:<br><br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Next, I see multiplication and subtraction. I've heard that multiplication usually comes before subtraction, so I'll do those next:<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>So now I have:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Adding and subtracting from left to right seems reasonable:<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So, I think the final answer is:<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think I just do things as they come from left to right! So first, I'll do 4 times 2 plus 5, which is like 8 plus 5, so that’s 13. Then I'll add 12 to that, which is 13 plus 12, and that makes 25. And then I subtract 2 times 3 from that. Well, 2 times 3 is 6, so 25 minus 6 is 19.<br><br>The answer is 19.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I think we have to do something with the numbers in the problem. My teacher said we should do some things before others. I think we should start with the stuff in parentheses first. So we have to add 2+5. That's 7!<br><br>Now we have 4 times 7, plus 12, minus 2 times 3. My teacher said that multiplication is like repeated adding, so we have to do that next. 4 times 7 is like 7 plus 7 plus 7 plus 7, which is... 28!<br><br>So now the problem looks like 28 plus 12, minus 2 times 3. We still have multiplication to do. Two times 3 is like 3 plus 3, which is 6.<br><br>Finally, we have 28 plus 12, minus 6. I know that 28 plus 12 is like 28 and then 10 more which is 38, and 2 more makes 40! So now we have 40 minus 6, which is... if you take away 6 from 40, you get 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm a grade 6 student and don't know about the order of operations yet, I might just do the math from left to right. So I would multiply 4 and 3 first, because that's the first thing I see. And 4 times 3 is 12. And then I would add 2 to 12, because that's the next thing in the question. So 12 plus 2 is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

So:<br><br>4 * 3 = 12<br><br>Then, I would add 2 to my result:<br><br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>So, if I solve it from left to right without considering any order of operations I don't know about, I would say:<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Umm, I think I will just do it the way it looks. So, first I multiply 4 with 3 because that's the first things I see. 4 times 3 is 12. Now I have 12, and then I have to add 2. So 12 plus 2 equals 14. I think that's how you do it!<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I'm like in elementary school and we just learned that when you add and multiply, you can do it like this:<br><br>First I see a 4 times 3, which is like 4 added 3 times. So that's 4 plus 4 plus 4. That's 12! Then, I see there's a plus 2. So I just take the 12 and add 2 more. Let's count it out: 12... 13, 14!<br><br>So, I think the answer is 14. <br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, since I haven't learned about order of operations, I might just try to solve the problem from left to right.

However, I've heard from older friends that there's a "correct" way to do these things where you're supposed to do the multiplication before the addition.

      <td>GPT Response: Umm, I think you just do it from left to right like reading? So first you do 5 plus 2, which is 7, and then multiply that by 4... so 7 times 4 is 28, right?<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I'm like in elementary school and we haven't learned about any fancy operation order, but I think we just do it as we see it from left to right. So you just add 5 plus 2 which is 7, and then you multiply that by 4. That's like having seven candies, and getting 4 whole sets, which is a lot! So, 7 times 4 is 28 because 7 plus 7 is 14, and if you do that two times you get 28.<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
