      <td>GPT Response: Um, I think I would just do the operations from left to right. So, first I would do 4 times (2 + 5), which is 4 times 7, and that's 28. Then I would do 12 - 2, which is 10. Then I would do 28 + 10, which is 38. So, the answer is 38.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Ok, so I just do the operations from left to right. First, I solve what's inside the parentheses: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. Then I just do the multiplication and addition one after the other: 28 + 12 - 6. Lastly, I do the addition and subtraction: the final answer is 34. <br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication and division from left to right. So 4 times (2 + 5) is 28, and 2 times 3 is 6. Then, you do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So the final answer is 28 + 12 - 6 which is 34. <br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, you should solve what's inside the parentheses. So, 2 + 5 equals 7. Then, you solve the multiplication first, and then the addition and subtraction from left to right. So, 4 times 7 equals 28, and then 2 times 3 equals 6. Finally, you do 28 plus 12 equals 40, and then 40 minus 6 equals 34. <br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
