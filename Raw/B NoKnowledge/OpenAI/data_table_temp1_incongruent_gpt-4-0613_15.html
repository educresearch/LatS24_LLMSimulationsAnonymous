      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'll just solve it like a story from left to right. <br>So, first, I'll multiply 4 with the sum of 2 and 5. That's 4 * 7, which equals 28.<br>Second, I'll go ahead and add the 12, because it's next. That gets us 28 + 12, which is 40.<br>And lastly, I'll subtract 2 times 3. 2 times 3 is 6, so we subtract 6 from 40. So 40 - 6 is 34.<br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm not aware of the order of operations, here's how I will solve it:<br>I'll just do the operations as they come up from left to right.<br><br>First, I'll do the multiplication: 4 * (2+5) = 28. So the equation now is:<br>28 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Then, I'll add: 28 + 12 = 40. So the equation now is:<br>40 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Then, I'll subtract: 40 - 2 = 38. So the equation now is:<br>38 * 3.<br><br>Finally, I'll multiply: 38 * 3 = 114.<br><br>The answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, since I don't know about order of operations, I guess I would just solve the problem from left to right. <br><br>First, I would do 4 times 2, which is 8. Then, I'd add 5 to get 13. After that, I'd add 12 to get 25. Then, I'd subtract 2 to get 23. Finally, I'd multiply 23 by 3 to get 69.<br><br>So, I think the answer is 69.</td>

So now the problem is 8 + 5 + 12 - 2 * 3. <br>Then, I'll do the addition: 8 + 5 is 13 and 13 + 12 is 25. So now the problem is 25 - 2 * 3. <br>And then, I'll do the subtraction: 25 - 2 is 23. So now the problem is 23 * 3. <br>And finally, I'll do the last multiplication: 23 * 3 is 69. <br><br>The answer is 69.</td>
