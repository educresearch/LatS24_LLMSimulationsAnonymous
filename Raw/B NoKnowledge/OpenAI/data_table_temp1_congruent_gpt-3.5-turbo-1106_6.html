      <td>GPT Response: First, you do what's inside the parentheses. So, 2 + 5 equals 7. Then you do the multiplication first before the addition and subtraction. So, 4 * 7 equals 28 and 2 * 3 equals 6. Lastly, you do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So, 28 + 12 equals 40 and 40 - 6 equals 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication inside the parentheses. 4 times (2+5) is 28. Then, we have 28 + 12 - 2*3. Next, we do the multiplication, so 2*3 is 6. So, we have 28 + 12 - 6. Finally, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right, so 28 + 12 is 40, and 40 - 6 is 34. <br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication inside the parentheses: 4*(2 + 5) equals 4*7. Then, you multiply 4*7 which equals 28. Then, you add 28 + 12, which equals 40. After that, you subtract 40 - 2*3. Then, you do the multiplication 2*3 which equals 6. Finally, you subtract 40 - 6. The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we do what's inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5. That equals 7. Then we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. After that, we add 12 to 28, which equals 40. Then we subtract 2 times 3, which is 6, from 40, and that equals 34.<br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
