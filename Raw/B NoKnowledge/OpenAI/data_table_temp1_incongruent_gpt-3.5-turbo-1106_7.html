So, first I'll do 4 * (2+5), which is 4 * 7, and then add 12, and then subtract 2 * 3. <br><br>So, 4 * 7 is 28, then add 12, which is 40, and then subtract 2 * 3, which is 6. <br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I'll do what's inside the parentheses: 2+5 = 7.<br>Then, I'll do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6.<br>Now, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40 and 40 - 6 = 34.<br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I will do the operations inside the parentheses, which are 2+5. This equals 7. Then, I will do the multiplication and division from left to right, so 4 * 7 is 28 and 2 * 3 is 6. Then, I will do the addition and subtraction from left to right, so 28+12 is 40 and 40-6 is 34. Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I will do the operations inside the parentheses: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. Then I will do the multiplication first: 28 + 12 - 6. Lastly, I will do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 40 - 6. Then the final answer is 34. So, the answer is 34.</td>
