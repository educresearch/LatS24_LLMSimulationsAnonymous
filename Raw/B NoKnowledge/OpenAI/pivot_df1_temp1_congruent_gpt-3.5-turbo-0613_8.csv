gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will first solve the operations inside the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5, which gives us 7. 

Next, I will multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. 

Then, I will subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which equals 6. 

Finally, I will add 12 to 28 and subtract 6 from that sum. 

Therefore, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: First, I will multiply 3 and 2, because multiplication comes before addition. 
So, 3 * 2 equals 6.
Now, I will add 5 and 6 together.
