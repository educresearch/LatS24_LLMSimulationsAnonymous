      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will use the order of operations. The order of operations is a rule that tells us how to solve problems step by step.<br><br>First, I will solve what is inside the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5 which equals 7. So, 4 * 7 is equal to 28.<br><br>Next, I will multiply and divide from left to right. There is no division here, so I will move on to multiplication. We have 4 * 7 which equals 28.<br><br>Now, I will add and subtract from left to right. We have 28 + 12 - 2 * 3. First, I will do the multiplication. 2 * 3 equals 6. So, our problem is now 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Finally, I will do the addition and subtraction. 28 + 12 equals 40. Then, I will subtract 6 from 40. 40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we need to solve what's inside the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, there is 2+5 which equals 7. <br><br>Then, we can multiply 4 by 7, which gives us 28. <br><br>Next, we solve the multiplication of 2*3, which equals 6. <br><br>After that, we add 12 and subtract 6 from 28. <br><br>So, the final answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will start by adding 2 and 5, which equals 7. Then, I multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. Next, I subtract 2 times 3, which equals 6. Finally, I add 12 and 6, which equals 18. <br>          Therefore, the answer is 18.</td>
