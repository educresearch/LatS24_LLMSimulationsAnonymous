gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Oh, I think this is like a puzzle! We have to do things in a special order, just like when you do stuff in games. My friend said you have to do the stuff inside the brackets first. So let's see... 

First, I'll do the addition inside the brackets. So, 2 plus 5 is 7. 

Now the problem looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, I think you do the times—multiplication things. So, 4 times 7 is 28, and 2 times 3 is 6. 

Now it's like this: 28 + 12 - 6.

Then, I do the adding and subtracting from the left to the right. So, 28 plus 12 is 40, and then take away 6 from 40, which is 34.

So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: Okay, so since I'm in grade 6 and haven't learned about the order of operations yet, I might just do the operations from left to right. But, let me try to figure this out step by step, and maybe there is a smarter way to do it:

First, I see there are parentheses in the problem: (2+5). I think I should calculate what's inside them first.
2 + 5 = 7

Now the expression looks like this:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I see some multiplication signs, and I think those are important. Multiplication probably comes before addition and subtraction.
So, 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6

Replacing that in the expression, we get:
28 + 12 - 6

Now I just add and subtract from left to right.
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So, I think, even without knowing PEMDAS, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I might just do the calculations from left to right as I read them, like this:

First I see 4 and a multiplication sign and then there's a parentheses with 2+5. But I'm not sure how to deal with those. Maybe I just add what's inside first because they kind of make a little room for 2 and 5 to be together, like they're having a party and don't want to be bothered. So:

2 + 5 equals 7.

The problem now looks like this:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

I guess I keep going from left to right.

So now I multiply 4 times 7:

4 * 7 equals 28.

Now my math problem looks like this:

28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Keep going from left to right...

28 + 12 equals 40.

The problem is now:

40 - 2 * 3

Subtract 2 from 40:

40 - 2 equals 38.

Finally, you multiply by 3:

38 * 3 is... oh, uh, I don't know really big numbers multiplication yet, but I can add 38 three times like this:

38 + 38 + 38 - I can do this part! It's like stacking blocks and then counting them all. So that would be... 76 and then 114!

So, if I did it from left to right without knowing any special maths rules, I'd probably say:

The answer is 114.","GPT Response: So, first I think we should add the numbers in the parentheses because it's like they're in a little bubble. So that's 2 + 5 which is 7. Then we have 4 times that bubble, so 4 * 7, that's like 4 plus 4 plus 4 plus 4 plus 4 plus 4 plus 4, which is 28.

Then we also add 12, so 28 plus 12 is 40.

And there's this other part where we multiply 2 times 3, which makes 6.

So we had 40, and then we take away 6 since we subtract at the end. So what's 40 minus 6? That’s like if you have 40 candies and eat 6, you have 34 candies left.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Oh, I think I remember my teacher mentioning something about doing multiplication before addition. So, I guess I should multiply 4 by 3 first, which is 12, and then add the 2. So it will be like 12 + 2, which equals 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: So, I just learned this cool rule that helps us figure out math problems like this. It's called the order of operations, and it helps us know what to do first. My teacher told us to remember it like this: PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

For the problem 4*3+2, here's what I would do:

1. Look for Parentheses; there are none here.
2. Look for Exponents; none here either.
3. Now, do the Multiplication or Division (from left to right). So I'll multiply 4 and 3 first.
4 * 3 = 12

4. Now, do the Addition or Subtraction (from left to right). I just add 12 and 2 together.
12 + 2 = 14

So, after doing the multiplication first and then the addition, the answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Well, I think you just do it in the order it's written, so first you do 4 times 3, which is 12, and then you add 2. So it would be like 12 plus 2, which is 14. The answer is 14.","GPT Response: You just have to do the multiplication first and then add the number after that. So, you do 4 times 3, which is 12, and then you add 2. If you add 12 and 2, you get 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Oh, I think I remember my teacher saying something about doing multiplication before addition. So, I should multiply 2 by 4 first, which is 8, and then add 5 to that. So 5 plus 8 is 13.

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: So, I just learned this cool rule that helps solve math problems like this one! It is called ""PEMDAS,"" and it stands for:

P - Parentheses first
E - Exponents (like squares and square roots, etc.)
MD - Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS - Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

So looking at the problem 5 + 2 * 4, we don't have any parentheses or exponents to worry about. According to PEMDAS, we do multiplication before addition. So, we should multiply 2 and 4 first.

2 times 4 is 8.

Now we replace the 2 * 4 in the problem with 8, so it becomes:

5 + 8.

Then we just add 5 and 8 together.

5 plus 8 equals 13.

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: Well, I think you just do it from left to right, like when you read! So first you do 5 plus 2 which is 7, and then you multiply that by 4. So 7 times 4 is 28. 

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: When solving math problems, there's a really cool trick called ""Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally,"" or PEMDAS, which tells you which order to do things. 

P stands for Parentheses: do what’s inside them first.
E is for Exponents: do those next, like if you have numbers with a square or cube.
M and D are next, they stand for Multiply and Divide, and you do these from left to right.
Lastly, A and S, they stand for Add and Subtract, also done from left to right.

So for 5+2*4, we don't have parentheses or exponents, but we do have multiplication and addition.

The rule says we should do multiplication before we add. So let's do 2 times 4 first. 2 times 4 equals 8.

Then we add that to 5. So we go 5 plus 8 which equals 13.

The answer is 13."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Oh, I think I remember my teacher talking about this. She said that we need to do the multiplication part before we add or subtract things. So, I should multiply 3 times 2 first, and then add the 5 afterwards. Okay, here's what I'd do:

First, I multiply 3 by 2, which gives me 6.

Then I add that to 5, so 5 plus 6 equals 11.

So if I do it that way, the answer should be 11.

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: So, I just learned this cool rule that helps us figure out math problems like this. It's called the order of operations, and it helps us know what to do first. My teacher told us to remember ""PEMDAS,"" which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In the problem 5 + 3 * 2, there aren't any parentheses or exponents, so we don't have to worry about those parts. The ""M"" in PEMDAS tells us we need to do the multiplication part before we do any adding.

So we do the multiplication part first:

3 * 2 = 6

Now we take that result and add it to the 5:

5 + 6 = 11

So that's our answer! The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Well, I think you just do it from left to right, like when you read a sentence! So, first I would add 5 plus 3, which is 8, and then I would multiply 8 by 2, which is 16. So I think the answer is 16! 

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: When solving the problem 5 + 3 * 2, even as an elementary school student, I know that multiplication is something like repeated addition. So, I would first do the multiplication part because it's like saying 3 two times, which is 3 + 3, and that's 6. Then I would add the 5 last. So, first I multiply 3 times 2 which is 6, and then I add 5 to it, which gives me 11. 

The answer is 11."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Since I haven't learned about the order of operations or PEMDAS yet, I might just solve the problem from left to right like this:

First, I'll do the multiplication, since even without knowing the official rules, I've heard multiplication generally comes before addition.

So I'll do 7 times 2 first, which is 14.

Then I'll multiply 8 times 5, which is 40.

Now I have two numbers, 14 and 40, and I need to add them together:

14 + 40 equals 54.

So, I would say:

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: I just learned this cool rule called ""PEMDAS,"" which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). It tells us the order in which we should do operations in Math problems.

So for the problem 7*2+8*5, I need to do the multiplication parts first and then do the addition.

First, I multiply 7 by 2, which is 14.
Then, I multiply 8 by 5, which is 40.

After that, I add the two results together: 14 + 40.

14 + 40 equals 54.

So, the answer is 54.","GPT Response: Okay, so I don't know about any special rules for which order to do things in Math, but I like to just go from left to right, like when I read a book!

So first I see 7 times 2, which I know is 14, because I'm good at my times tables. Then I keep going and see plus 8, and then I know I have to multiply 8 times 5, which is 40.

Now I just combine those two! I got 14 and 40. So I add them together like this:

14 (from 7 times 2) 
+ 40 (from 8 times 5) 
= 54

So that means when you do 7*2+8*5 and you go from left to right like me, you get 54.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Okay, so I have to do the multiplying first because my teacher said if you see times or divide, you do those before you add or subtract. So first, I do 7 times 2 which is 14. Then, I do 8 times 5 which is 40. After that, I just have to add those two together, so 14 plus 40. 

14 plus 40 is 54 since 10 plus 40 is 50 and then I add the 4 to make 54.

The answer is 54."
