gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to use the order of operations. The order of operations tells me that I should do the multiplication first, and then the addition. So, I will multiply 2 and 4, which gives me 8. Then, I will add 5 to 8. The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to follow the order of operations. First, I need to multiply 7 by 2, which equals 14. Then, I need to multiply 8 by 5, which equals 40. Finally, I need to add 14 and 40 together. 
The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I multiply 4 by 3 first because it's the first operation I see. That equals 12. Then I add 2 to 12 because it's the second operation. So the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. First, we do any calculations inside parentheses. There are no parentheses in this problem, so we move on to the next step.

Next, we do any multiplication or division from left to right. We start with 4 * (2 + 5), which is equal to 4 * 7. That gives us 28.

Then, we have 28 + 12 - 2 * 3. We do the multiplication first: 2 * 3 is equal to 6.

Now we have 28 + 12 - 6. We do the addition from left to right: 28 + 12 is equal to 40.

Finally, we have 40 - 6. We do the subtraction: 40 - 6 is equal to 34.

So the final answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to use the order of operations. The order of operations tells me that I should do the multiplication first, and then the addition. So, I will multiply 3 and 2, which gives me 6. Then, I will add 5 to 6. The answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will perform the operations from left to right. First, I will multiply 2 by 4, which is equal to 8. Then I will add 5 to 8, which is equal to 13. 

The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will multiply 7 and 2 first, and then multiply 8 and 5. Finally, I will add the two products together. 

7 multiplied by 2 equals 14, and 8 multiplied by 5 equals 40. 

Now I will add 14 and 40 together. 

14 plus 40 equals 54. 

Therefore, the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will perform the multiplication first. So 4 multiplied by 3 is 12. Then, I will add 2 to the result. So, 12 plus 2 is 14. 
The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to follow the order of operations or PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction).

First, I need to solve the parentheses, which is 2 + 5 = 7.

Next, I need to solve the multiplication, which is 4 * 7 = 28.

Then, I can perform the multiplication again, which is 2 * 3 = 6.

Then, I can perform the addition and subtraction. 28 + 12 = 40. And 40 - 6 = 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34."

The answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Hmm, I'm not really sure about this order of operations thing, but I'll try my best! I see that there are two operations here: addition and multiplication. So, I'll just do them from left to right. First, I'll do the multiplication 2 * 4 which equals 8. And then I'll do the addition 5 + 8 which equals 13. So, I think the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will start by multiplying 7 and 2 because multiplication comes before addition. So, 7 times 2 equals 14. Then, I will multiply 8 and 5 because multiplication comes before addition. So, 8 times 5 equals 40. Lastly, I will add 14 and 40 together because addition is the last step. So, the final answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Hmm, let's see. I multiply 4 by 3 first, so I get 12. Then I add 2 to that, which gives me 14. 
So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: I would first solve the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, I would add 2 and 5 to get 7. Then, I would multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. Next, I would solve 2 multiplied by 3 to get 6. Finally, I would subtract 6 from 12 to get 6. So, the final answer is 6."

5 + 3 * 2 = 5 + 6

Now, I just need to add 5 and 6 together.

5 + 6 = 11
