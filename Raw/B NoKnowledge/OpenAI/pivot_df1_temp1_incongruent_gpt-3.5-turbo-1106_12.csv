gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2 * 4,GPT Response: I don't know what to do with this problem. Can you please teach me how to solve it? The answer is 13.
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Um, okay, so I think you have to do the multiplication first. So, 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40. Then, you add those together. So, 14 plus 40 is 54. So, the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: I don't know what to do with this, but I think I'll just do the operations from left to right. So, 4*3=12 and then add 2 to that, which equals 14. 
The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: I don't really know much about order of operations, but I think I just need to do the operations from left to right. First, I'll do 4 * (2+5) which is 4 * 7. Then I'll add 12 to that, and subtract 2 * 3. So the answer is 28. 
The answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3 * 2,GPT Response: I don't know what to do with this problem. Can you please teach me how to solve it? The answer is 11.
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Okay, so I don't know much about order of operations, but my teacher told me that I should always do the multiplication or division first before the addition or subtraction. So, I think I should do 2 * 4 first, which is 8, and then I can add 5 to it. So it's 5 + 8, which is 13. 
The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: First, I will solve 7 * 2 which is 14. Then I will solve 8 * 5 which is 40. Finally, I will add 14 and 40 together which gives me 54. 
So the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Okay, so I just do the operations from left to right. First, I multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then, I add 2 to get 14. 

So the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses. 2 + 5 equals 7. Then we solve the multiplication inside the parentheses. 4 * 7 equals 28. Now we solve the multiplication outside of the parentheses, 2 * 3 which equals 6. After that, we do addition and subtraction from left to right. 28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 6 equals 34. 

So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Okay, so I don't know much about order of operations, but my teacher told me that I should always do the multiplication or division first before the addition or subtraction. So, I think I need to do the multiplication first, which is 3 times 2, and then I can add 5 to the result. That gives me 6 plus 5, which equals 11. 
So, the answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication before the addition. So, we need to do 2 * 4 first, which equals 8. Then we add 5 to 8. So, the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Ummm... okay, so I think you have to do the multiplication first. So, 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40. Then, you add those together. So, 14 plus 40 is... um... 54! 
The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication, so 4 * 3 is 12. Then we add 2 to 12, which gives us 14. So the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, I solve the parentheses inside, and I get 4 * 7. Then I do the multiplication and get 28. Next, I add 12 and subtract 2 * 3 from 28. Lastly, I get 38 - 6, which is 32. So, the answer is 32."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Um, I think you just do the operations from left to right. So, 5 + 3 is 8 and then times 2 is 16. So, the answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: First, we need to do the multiplication before the addition. So, 2 * 4 equals 8. Then we can add 5 to 8, which equals 13.

The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: First, we can just go from left to right. So we do 7 times 2 first, which is 14. Then we add 8 times 5, which is 40. Finally, we add 14 and 40 to get 54.
The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: First, we multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then we add 2 to 12 and get 14. 
The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I added 2 and 5 together, which equals 7. Then I multiplied 4 by 7, which equals 28. After that, I multiplied 2 by 3, which equals 6. Then I added 12 to 28, which equals 40. Finally, I subtracted 6 from 40, which equals 34. 
The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: First, I just need to add 5 and 3 together, then I'll multiply the result by 2. So, 5 + 3 equals 8, and then 8 times 2 equals 16. 

The answer is 16."
