Inside the brackets is 2 + 5 which is easy, it's 7.\n\nNow the problem looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.\n\nNext, my teacher mentioned that multiplying is like having lots of groups of something, so I will do that next. 4 times 7 is like having 4 groups of 7 cookies, which gives me 28 cookies!\n\nSo now my problem is 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.\n\nNow I have to do another multiplication. The 2 * 3 part is like having 2 packs of stickers, with 3 stickers in each pack, that's 6 stickers!\n\nSo what I have to solve now is 28 + 12 - 6.\n\nAdding is like gathering stuff together. So if I have 28 marbles and I get 12 more, I now have 40 marbles.\n\nFinally, subtracting is like giving some away.
