      <td>4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, this looks tricky. I think I just need to solve it from left to right. First, I do what's inside the parentheses - 2+5 is 7. Then, I do 4 times 7, which is 28. Then, I do 2 times 3, which is 6. Finally, I add and subtract everything from left to right. So, 28 plus 12 is 40, and 40 minus 6 is 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I will solve what is inside the parentheses. So I will do 2 + 5 which equals 7. Then I will multiply 4 by 7 which gives 28. After that, I need to subtract 2 multiplied by 3 from 28, which equals 22.<br><br>The answer is 22.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. After that, we multiply 2 by 3 to get 6. Finally, we add and subtract from left to right: 28 + 12 - 6 = 34. <br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, you solve the numbers inside the parentheses. So, 2 + 5 equals 7. Then, you do the multiplication and division from left to right. 4 times 7 equals 28. Next, 2 times 3 equals 6. Finally, you do the addition and subtraction from left to right. 28 plus 12 equals 40, and 40 minus 6 equals 34. So, the answer is 34.</td>
