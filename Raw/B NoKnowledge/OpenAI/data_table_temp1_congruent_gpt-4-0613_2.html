      <td>GPT Response: I honestly do not know much about the order of operations in Mathematics or PEMDAS as you mentioned. But, I will simply try to solve the problem from left to right as I can only think that's logical. <br><br>First I will add 2 + 5 to get 7. Then I will multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. To that, I will add 12 and get 40. Afterwards, I will subtract 2 from 40 to get 38 and finally multiply 38 by 3 to get 114.<br><br>The answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I'll start doing the operations as they appear, from left to right.<br><br>First step: Multiply 4 by 2 which is 8<br>8 + 5 + 12 - 2*3<br><br>Next: Then, add 8 to 5, I get 13<br>13 + 12 - 2*3<br><br>Then: Add 13 to 12, we get 25<br>25 - 2*3<br><br>Finally: Subtract 2 times 3 (which is 6) from 25<br>25 - 6<br><br>This gives me 19.<br><br>So, the answer is 19.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I'd start by adding 2 + 5 which is 7. Then I would multiply the answer, 7 by 4, which is 28. After that, I would add 12 to 28, so that would be 40. Then finally, I would subtract 2*3 (which is 6) from 40. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, in this case, I'll solve it from left to right. <br><br>So, first we'll multiply 4 with 2, and then add 5 to get 13. Then, we continue to add 12 to 13 which comes out as 25. After that, we subtract 2 from 25 resulting in 23, and finally, we multiply 23 by 3 which equals 69.<br><br>The answer is 69.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: First, I would multiply 4 with 3 because those numbers are next to each other, which gives 12. Then, I'll add 12 and 2 together because addition is usually the next step after multiplication. So, the answer would be 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
