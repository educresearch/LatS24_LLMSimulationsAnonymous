I know that you have to do multiplication and division before addition and subtraction, so I'll start with that. Here we go:

First, I notice there's a number inside brackets. Maybe I should do that first: 

2+5 which equals 7.

So now the equation looks like this 4 * 7+12-2 * 3. 

Next, I will do the multiplication:

4*7 equals 28, and 2 * 3 gives us 6.

Now the equation looks like this 28+12-6.
