gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. First, we calculate what is inside the parentheses. In this case, 2+5 equals 7. 

Next, we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. 

Then, we add 28 and 12, which equals 40. 

After that, we multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. 

Finally, we subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34. 

So, the final answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will follow the order of operations (PEMDAS) which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, I will solve the expressions inside the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, there is the expression 2+5 which equals 7.

Now, the expression becomes 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, I will perform the multiplication. The expression 4 * 7 equals 28, and 2 * 3 equals 6.

Now, the expression becomes 28 + 12 - 6.

Finally, I will perform the addition and subtraction in order from left to right. The expression 28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 6 equals 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will start by following the order of operations. First, I will solve the addition inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5 = 7. Then, I will multiply 4 by 7, which is 28. Next, I will multiply 2 by 3, which is 6. Finally, I will subtract 6 from 28 and add 12, which gives me the final answer.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: In this problem, we need to solve the expression 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3 using order of operations. First, we look for any parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we have 2+5 which is equal to 7. So, the expression becomes 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. 

Next, we look for any multiplication or division operations. We have 4 * 7 which is equal to 28, and 2 * 3 which is equal to 6. So, the expression becomes 28 + 12 - 6.

Finally, we look for any addition or subtraction operations. We have 28 + 12 which is equal to 40, and then 40 - 6 which is equal to 34. 

So, the final answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. First, we multiply 4 and 3, which equals 12. Then, we add 2 to the result. So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will use the order of operations. According to this, I need to perform the multiplication first. So, 4 multiplied by 3 is 12. Then, I just need to add 2 to that. 12 plus 2 is 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, we need to multiply 4 by 3 because multiplication comes before addition. 4 times 3 equals 12. Then, we add 2 to 12. 12 plus 2 equals 14. 
Therefore, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: So, with this question, we have to do multiplication first and then addition. We have 4 times 3, which is 12. Then we add 2 to get the final answer. The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. First, we need to perform the multiplication. So, 2 multiplied by 4 is equal to 8.
