      <td>GPT Response: First, we need to calculate the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.<br><br>Then, we can multiply 4 by 7: 4 * 7 = 28.<br><br>Next, we add 28 to 12: 28 + 12 = 40.<br><br>Finally, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3: 2 * 3 = 6. 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations tells us to do any calculations inside parentheses first. In this case, we have (2 + 5), which equals 7. <br><br>Next, we multiply 4 by 7, which gives us 28. <br><br>Then, we add 28 to 12, which gives us 40. <br><br>Finally, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which is 6, from 40. <br><br>So, the final answer is 40 - 6 = 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, this looks like a math problem. Let me try to solve it step by step.<br><br>First, I see the multiplication symbols (*) and parentheses ( ) in the equation. According to what I learned, I should start with the parentheses first. Inside the parentheses, I have 2 + 5, which equals 7. <br><br>Now, I can rewrite the equation as 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. <br><br>Next, I need to do the multiplication. Multiplying 4 and 7 gives me 28, and multiplying 2 and 3 gives me 6.<br><br>So now, I have 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Finally, I can add and subtract from left to right. Adding 28 and 12 gives me 40, and subtracting 6 from 40 gives me 34.<br><br>So the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will follow the order of operations. First, I have to solve everything inside the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, I have 2 + 5 which equals 7. Then, I have to multiply 4 by 7 which equals 28. Next, I add 12 to 28 which equals 40. Then, I have to multiply 2 by 3 which equals 6. Finally, I have to subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34.<br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
