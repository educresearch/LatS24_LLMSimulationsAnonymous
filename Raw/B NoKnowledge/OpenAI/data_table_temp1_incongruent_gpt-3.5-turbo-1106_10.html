      <td>GPT Response: Um, I think I just do the operations from left to right. So that's 4 times 7, plus 12, minus 2 times 3. So that's 28 plus 12 minus 6. Um, so the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, when you solve this, you start with the parentheses first. Inside the parentheses, you add 2 and 5, which equals 7. Then you multiply that by 4, which equals 28. <br><br>Next, you look at the subtraction and do that before moving on to the addition. So, 12 minus 2 equals 10.<br><br>Finally, you do the multiplication, which is 2 times 3, which equals 6.<br><br>So, the final answer is 28 + 10 - 6 = 32</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, you should do the stuff in the parentheses, so 2 + 5 equals 7. Then do 4 times 7 which equals 28. After that, do 2 times 3 which equals 6. Finally, add 12 and subtract 6 from 28. So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7. Then we multiply 4 by 7 which equals 28. Then, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3 from 28, which equals 22. Finally, we add 12 to get the final answer. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
