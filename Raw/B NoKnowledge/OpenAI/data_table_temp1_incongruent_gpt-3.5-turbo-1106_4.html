      <td>GPT Response: Umm, I'm not really sure how to do this. But I think I should just do the operations one at a time from left to right. So first, I'll do 2+5, which is 7. Then 4 times 7 is 28. After that, I'll do 2 times 3, which is 6. Then I add 12 to 28, which is 40. Finally, I subtract 6 from 40, which is 34. <br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we do what's inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 which equals 7. Then, we do the multiplication first: 4 * 7 equals 28. Then, we do the multiplication again: 2 * 3 which equals 6. Then, we add and subtract from left to right: 28 + 12 - 6 equals 34. So, the final answer is 34. Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
