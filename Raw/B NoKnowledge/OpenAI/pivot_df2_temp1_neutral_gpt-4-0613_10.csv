gpt-4-0613,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, I'll add 2 and 5 to get 7. Then, I'll multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. 
Next, I'll add 12 to get 40. 
After that, I will subtract 2 to get 38. 
Lastly, I'll multiply 3 by 2 and subtract the result from 38 to get the final answer.

The answer is 32.","GPT Response: Okay, I am not aware of PEMDAS rule so I'll solve it just like how I read it in a simple way as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

Start from left to right:

First, 4*(2+5) equals 28, so it now reads 28+12-2*3.

Then, go to the next operation: 28+12 equals 40, so it now reads 40-2*3.

Then, 40-2 equals 38, leaving you with 38*3.

Finally, 38*3 equals 114.

The answer is 114.","GPT Response: First, I think I should add the numbers in the bracket, so 2 plus 5 equals 7. 
Then, I would multiply the 4 outside the bracket by this sum which is 7. So, 4 times 7 equals 28.
Next, I would add 12 to 28 which gives 40.
Lastly, I would subtract 2 times 3 which is 6 from 40.
So, my final answer is 40 minus 6 equals 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I can do the addition in the parentheses. 2 + 5 equals 7. Then I would multiply 4 times 7 which is 28. Then I will subtract 2 times 3 from 12. 2 times 3 is 6, and 12 minus 6 is 6. And finally, let me add the two results from these operations which are 28 and 6. 28 plus 6 is 34. 

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: As a 6th grader who doesn't know about the order of operations, I would just solve the problem from left to right. 
First, I would multiply 4 by 3, which gives me 12. Then, I add 2 to 12, which gives me 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I'll just solve the problem from left to right.

First, I'll multiply 4 by 3, which gives me 12.

Then, I'll add the 2 to the 12, which gives me 14.

So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: Since I haven't learned about the order of operations in Mathematics, I would just do the operations in the order that they come from left to right. 

First I would do the multiplication, 4 times 3 is 12. Then add 2 to the result as the sum comes after the multiplication in the question.

 So, 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, I will solve the multiplication part of the problem. The multiplication is 4 times 3, which equals 12. Then I add 2 to the 12 which equals 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: As a 6th grader who doesn't know about the order of operations, I would simply go from left to right, like I read a sentence.

So, let's start: 

First, I would do the addition. 5 + 2 equals 7.

Then, I would take that answer (7) and multiply by 4 (since that's the next operation).

So 7 * 4 equals 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would just solve the problem from left to right.

First, I would add 5 and 2, which gives 7.

Then, I would multiply 7 by 4. That gives 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Since I haven't learned about the order of operations in Mathematics, I would just do this problem from left to right.

First, I will add 5 and 2. That gives me 7.
Then, I will multiply 7 and 4. That gives me 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: I haven't learned about order of operations yet, so I will just do the problem from left to right. First, I'll add 5 + 2 which equals 7. Then, I will multiply 7 with 4 since that's the next one. 7 times 4 equals 28.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: As a 6th grader who doesn't know about the order of operations, I would just solve the problem from left to right. 
So, I would first add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then I would multiply that by 2 to get 16.

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would just solve the problem from left to right.

First, I would add 5 and 3, which gives 8.

Then, I would multiply 8 by 2, which gives 16.

gpt-4-0613,1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Well, I'd start by doing what looks simple to me. First, I'd take 7 times 2, which gives 14. I would then add 8 to it, resulting in 22. After that, I'd multiply 22 by 5, giving me a final answer of 110. 

Therefore, the answer is 110.","GPT Response: First I'll do the multiplication statements. So, 7 times 2 equals 14 and 8 times 5 equals 40. Now, adding up those results, 14 plus 40 equals 54. 

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Well, since I don't know about the order of operations, I would just solve this problem from left to right. 

First, I would multiply 7 by 2, which gives 14. 

Then, I'll add this to 8, which gives 22.

And lastly, I'd multiply 22 by 5, which gives 110.

So, the answer is 110.","GPT Response: First, I'm going to do 7 times 2 which is 14. Then, I'll do 8 times 5 which is 40. Lastly, I'll add up those two results: 14 plus 40 equals 54.
