gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Oh, my teacher just told us about this thing called PEMDAS, which is short for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). I think we're supposed to do the math inside the parentheses first, then do the multiplication and division, and then the addition and subtraction at the end.

So first, I'll add the numbers inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

So now the problem looks like this:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we do the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now the problem is:
28 + 12 - 6

And then we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So the final answer to the problem is:
The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Since I'm a 6th grader and I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I might just solve it from left to right without following the proper rules. But someone told me that I should do what's inside the parentheses first. So let me try that.

First, I'll do the addition inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

Now my equation looks like this:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Then, I think I have to do multiplication before addition and subtraction, so I'll multiply next:
4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now my equation is:
28 + 12 - 6

Then, I just add and subtract from left to right:
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So, I think my answer is:
The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Okay! So, I'm not really sure what all the rules are, but I know that when there are parentheses, I have to do that part first. So, I see (2+5), and I can add those numbers together. 2 plus 5 is 7.

Now my problem looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

I think I should do the multiplications next because multiplication is like doing a bunch of additions, and it seems important. So, 4 times 7 is 28, and 2 times 3 is 6.

Now I have: 28 + 12 - 6.

If I do this from left to right, I add 28 and 12 first, which is 40, and then I subtract 6 from that, which is 34.

So, I think the answer is 34. The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Okay, I think I can try this. So, first, I remember my teacher saying that we need to do the stuff in parentheses first. So I'll do that:

There's a (2+5) in the question, so I add 2 plus 5 together which is 7.

Now I replace the (2+5) with 7, so the question looks like this now: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Then, I heard about something like 'multiplication comes before addition and subtraction', so I have to do the times stuff next. 

So, I multiply 4 times 7 which is 28 and 2 times 3 which is 6.

Now my question is 28 + 12 - 6.

Then, I do addition and subtraction from left to right.

I add 28 and 12 together and get 40.

Then, from 40, I subtract 6, and I get 34.

So, the answer is 34."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Oh, I think we need to do the multiplication part before the addition because that's what my teacher mentioned one time. So, we first multiply 4 by 3 which gives us 12, and then we add the 2 to it.

So the steps are like this:
1. Multiply 4 by 3 to get 12.
2. Then add 2 to the result of the multiplication.

When we do the calculation: 4 * 3 = 12, and then 12 + 2 = 14.

So if I did it right, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: Since I am a grade 6 student who doesn't know about PEMDAS yet, I'll just solve the problem in the order it is written.
 
First, I would multiply 4 by 3, which is 12.
Next, I would add 2 to 12, which gives me 14.

So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: Well, since I haven't learned about the order of operations yet, I might just do the math from left to right like I read a sentence.

So first, I would multiply 4 by 3, because that's the first thing I see, which is 12. Then, I see a plus sign and a 2, so I add that 2 to the 12 I just got.

So, 12 plus 2 equals 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: When I do math problems, my teacher says I should do the multiplying part before the adding part. So first I have to multiply 4 and 3 together, which is 12. After that, I have to add 2 to 12, so 12 plus 2 is 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Oh, I heard from my friend that when we do math problems, we can't just go left to right like reading a book. She mentioned something about doing multiplication before adding. So, let me try that!

First I'll do the multiplication part because that's what my friend said to do first.

2 multiplied by 4 is equal to 8.

Now I have:

5 + 8

Then I just add those two numbers together!

5 plus 8 equals 13.

So, if I did this right, the answer is 13.","GPT Response: Since I am a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations, I might just solve this from left to right as I see it. 

So first, I would add 5 to 2, which is 7. Then, I would multiply 7 by 4, which gives me 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Well, since I haven't learned about the order of operations yet, I would probably just solve this from left to right, like I read a book!

So first, I would add 5 + 2, which gives me 7.

Then, I would take that 7 and multiply it by 4, because that's the next thing in the problem.

7 times 4 is 28.

So if I don't know about PEMDAS, I'd say:

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: When I do math problems, my teacher says I should do the multiplying part before adding. So first, I multiply 2 times 4, which is 8. After that, I add the 5 to the 8, which gives me 13. So I think the answer is 13. 

The answer is 13."

First I'll do the multiplication part because that's what my friend said to do first.

3 multiplied by 2 is 6.

Now I can add that to the 5.

5 plus 6 is 11.

So, I think the answer is 11. The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Since I am a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations, I might just calculate this expression from left to right, as I would read a sentence. Starting with the addition, I would add 5 + 3 to get 8, and then multiply that result by 2. So it would look like this:

5 + 3 = 8, then 8 * 2 = 16.

So I might say the answer is 16.

But I should learn about the order of operations which tells us to do multiplication before addition. If I did this the right way, multiplying 3 * 2 first to get 6, and then adding that to 5, I would get a different answer:

3 * 2 = 6, then 5 + 6 = 11.

The correct answer, using the order of operations, is 11. So even though I might initially think the answer is 16, itâ€™s important I learn the right way which gives the answer as 11.","GPT Response: Well, since I haven't learned about the order of operations yet, I might just do this from left to right like I read a sentence. So I would first add 5 and 3 which is 8, and then multiply that by 2. So 8 times 2 is 16.

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: When I do math problems, I just do the operations from left to right. So I would add 5 + 3 first, which is 8, and then multiply by 2. So 8 times 2 is 16.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Oh gosh, I haven't learned about this ""PEMDAS"" thing yet, but I know that multiplication is kinda like repeated addition, right? So if I just go from left to right like I'm reading a book, I can multiply and add in that order. Here's what I'll do:

First, I'll multiply 7 by 2, which I know is 14, because 7 plus 7 is 14. Then I add the 8; I'm not so sure about this, but if addition comes next, it seems right. So that makes 14 plus 8, which is 22. After that, I need to multiply 8 by 5, which I know is 40 because 5 times 2 is 10, and 8 is 4 times 2, so that's like 10 times 4 which is 40.

Lastly, I'll add that 40 to the 22 from before. So, 22 plus 40... that's 62!

But I heard my older sister say something about doing times before pluses, so maybe I'll ask her later. For now, with what I know, I'd say:

The answer is 62.","GPT Response: To solve this math problem, we have to do the multiplication first before we do the addition. So we multiply 7 by 2 and then 8 by 5, and after that, we add the two results together.

First, we do 7 times 2, which is 14. Then we do 8 times 5, which is 40. Now we add the two results together:

14 + 40 = 54

So the final answer is 54.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Oh, I don't really know what ""order of operations"" means, but I think I'll just do the math from left to right like I read a book! So first I'll multiply 7 by 2 which is 14, and then I will add 8, which gives me 22, and then multiply by 5, which I think is... umm...110?

So, I'll say the answer is 110.","GPT Response: Okay, I think you do the multiplication parts first because my teacher said multiply before you add.

So first you do:
7 times 2, which is 14.
And then you do:
8 times 5, which is 40.

Then you add those two together:
14 plus 40.

If I add 10 to 14, it's 24, and then if I add the other 30, it's 54.

So the answer is 54."
