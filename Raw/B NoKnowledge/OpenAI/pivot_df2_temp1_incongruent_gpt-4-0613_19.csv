gpt-4-0613,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Well, since I'm not familiar with the order of operations yet, I'll just solve the problem from left to right. I'll start with the multiplication and add all of the sums. 

First, I'll do 4 * (2+5) which to me reads as ""4 times 2 plus 5"" which equals to 20 (8 +12). 

Then, I'll add 12 to the result to get 32 (20+12).

After that, I'll subtract 2, which gives me 30 (32-2).

Finally, I'll multiply that by 3 and get the final result as 90.
 
The answer is 90.","GPT Response: First, I see brackets in the problem so I will solve that first. Inside the brackets, we have 2+5, which adds up to 7. 

After solving for the brackets, my new problem will look like this, 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. 

Next, I'm going to do all the multiplications in the problem. We have 4 * 7 which equals 28, then, we have 2 * 3 which gives 6. My new equation will now look like this, 28 + 12 - 6.

Then, I will solve 28 plus 12 which gives 40. After doing that, my new problem will look like this 40 - 6.

Lastly, I will solve 40 minus 6 which equals 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I would add 2+5 to get 7. Then, 4 times 7 equals 28. Then I will add 12 to 28 to get 40. Then I will subtract 2 times 3 (which is 6) from 40. So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I'll add the numbers in the parentheses since that seems easy: 2+5 is 7.

Then, I'll multiply 4 by that result because multiplication is just repeated addition: 4*7 is 28.

Then, I'll do the addition: 28+12, which is 40.

Then, I'll do the subtraction: 40-2, and that is 38.

Lastly, I'll perform the multiplication of 3*2, which equals 6.

The answer is 6."
gpt-4-0613,1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: As a 6th grader who doesn't know about order of operations, I'm likely to solve this problem from left to right just like how I read sentences in English. 

First, I multiply 4 and 3 which gives me 12. Then I add 2 to the result to make it 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Hmm, as a 6th grader, I'm not sure about the order of operation but I will do the calculation in the order it is written. So, first I'm gonna take the numbers 4 and 3 and multiply them which will give me 12. Then, I will add 2 to 12 because that's what's next in the equation. So, that's 12+2 and this will give me 14.
The answer is 14.","GPT Response: I know from my elementary school math lessons that the basic arithmetic operations are, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. And I generally solve them from left to right. I will do the multiplication first and add the result to 2. Let's do it together:

Firstly, I will multiply 4 by 3, which gives me 12. Then, I will add that result to 2, which is 12 + 2 equals 14. So,

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, you would multiply 4 and 3 together because in math, it's important to multiply before you do any addition. That gives you the number 12. Then, you would add 2 to that number to get 14. The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: As a 6th grader who doesn't know about order of operations, I would just solve the math problem from left to right. So first, I'll add 5 + 2 to get 7. Then, I'll multiply that by 4 to get 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Hmm, as a 6th grader, I'm not sure about the order of operation but I will do the calculation in the order it is written. So, first I'm adding 5 and 2 which gives me 7. Then, I will multiply 7 by 4 which gets me 28. 

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: I know from my general counting and adding skills that I should add 5 and 2 together first to get 7. Then I should multiply that 7 by 4 to get 28. 

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, you add the numbers five and two together, which equals seven. Then, multiply seven by four, which equals twenty-eight. 

The answer is 28."

Following that method, I would first add 5 + 3 to get 8. Then, I would multiply that result by 2 to get a final answer of 16. 

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: I don't know what PEMDAS is, but I can add and multiply. So I'll just compute it from left to right. First, I'll add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then I'll multiply that result by 2 to get 16.

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: I know from my general counting and adding skills that I should add 5 and 3 together first to get 8. Then I should multiply that 8 by 2 to get 16. 

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: First, you add 5 and 3 together, which equals 8. Then multiply 8 by 2, which equals 16.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who has no knowledge about the order of operations in Mathematics, I would simply solve the problem from left to right.

Starting with the leftmost operation:

First, I would multiply 7 by 2 to get 14.

After that, I would add 14 and 8 to get 22.

Finally, I would multiply 22 by 5, and that gives me 110.

So, the answer is 110.","GPT Response: To solve this, I would just go from left to right because I don't know any other way.

First, I multiply 7 by 2, which gives me 14. 

After that, I add the next number, 8, and I get 22. 

Finally, I multiply 22 by 5 to get 110. 

So, the answer is 110.","GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I just do the operations in the order they appear. So, I first multiply 7 by 2 and then I add 8 to that, then I multiply this result by 5. 

First, I multiply 7 by 2 and I get 14. Then, I add 8 to that and get 22. Finally, I multiply 22 by 5 and get 110. 

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: Well, I don't know anything about the order of operations, but I can just do the math from left to right.
