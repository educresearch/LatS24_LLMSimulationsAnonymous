      <td>GPT Response: First, I'll just do the operations from left to right. So, 4 times (2 + 5) is 28, then plus 12 is 40, then minus 2 times 3 is 34. The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Ok, so first I will do the operations inside the parentheses. 2 + 5 is 7. Then I will multiply 4 by 7, which is 28. Then I will do the operations with the numbers outside the parentheses. 28 + 12 is 40. Then I will multiply 2 by 3, which is 6. Finally, I will subtract 6 from 40, which is 34. <br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. After that, we do the operations in the order they appear from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40. Then, we do 2 * 3 = 6. Finally, we do 40 - 6 = 34. So, the answer is 34.</td>
