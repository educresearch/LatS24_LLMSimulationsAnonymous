gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Oh, I heard my older sibling talking about something like this. They said there's a special way to do math problems with lots of different numbers and symbols. I think you're supposed to do the multiplication and the stuff inside the parentheses before you do the addition and subtraction. 

So, if I look at this: 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3

First, I should do what's inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5. 

2 + 5 equals 7.

Now I have: 4*7 + 12 - 2*3

Then I do the multiplication parts next. So 4 times 7 is 28, and 2 times 3 is 6.

Now it looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

After that, I do the adding and subtracting. So, 28 + 12 is 40.

Finally, 40 - 6 is 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: When we solve math problems like this, we need to follow the rules that tell us what to do first. We do the things inside parentheses first, so we look at (2 + 5). If we add 2 and 5, we get 7. 

So now our problem looks like this: 4*7 + 12 - 2*3.

After parentheses, we do any multiplication or division from left to right. First we'll multiply 4 and 7. When we multiply them, we get 28.

Now our problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2*3.

Next, we'll do the multiplication of 2 and 3. Multiplying these together gives us 6.

So the problem is now: 28 + 12 - 6.

Finally, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right. Let's add 28 and 12 first, which gives us 40.

Our problem is now: 40 - 6.

And if we take 6 away from 40, we end up with 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: So, I would first do the adding and subtracting, because those seem easiest. So, 2 plus 5 is 7, and then 12 minus 2 is 10, right? So it would look like this in my head: 4 times 7 plus 10 times 3.

Then I'd multiply the numbers because that's what you do with numbers next to each other. 4 times 7 is 28, and then 10 times 3 is 30.

Finally, I add the two answers together! 28 plus 30 is 58.

The answer is 58.","GPT Response: Okay, so first we have to do the stuff in the parentheses. The stuff inside the parentheses is 2 + 5, which equals 7.

Next, we multiply that 7 by 4 because it's outside the parentheses and touching them which means it wants to multiply. 4 times 7 is 28.

Now we have 28 plus 12 and then we subtract 2 times 3. I know 2 times 3 is 6 because that's easy to remember.

So let's put it all together now. We have 28 plus 12, which makes 40. Then we take 40 minus 6 because we have to take away that 2 times 3 we did earlier. That leaves us with 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Okay, since I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I might just solve this from left to right like I read a book.

So first I see 4 multiplied by 3 which is 12, then I see a plus sign and then a 2. 

So I'll take the 12 and add 2 to it. 

12 + 2 is 14.

So I think the answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Oh, okay, so here's how I think about it. I know that multiplication is like adding the same number several times. So, if I have 4*3, that means I have 4 added together 3 times, which is 4 + 4 + 4. And that equals 12 because 4+4 is 8, then 8+4 is 12.

Then, I need to add 2 to that total. So I take the 12 from the multiplication and add 2 to it, like 12 + 2, which equals 14.

So, the answer to 4*3 + 2 is 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Oh, I think you just do the math from left to right like reading a book. So first, you take 4 times 3 which is 12, and then you add 2. So 12 plus 2 is 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Oh! I think I can do this. So first, I'll do the multiplication part because it seems like it is a bigger deal than addition. So 4 times 3 is like having four cookies three times! That's 12 cookies. Yum!

Now, I have to add 2 to it. So if I have 12 cookies and I get 2 more from my friend, I'll have 14 cookies! So the answer is 14. That's a lot of cookies to eat!

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Okay, since I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I might just solve this from left to right, like I read a book! So I would add 5 and 2 first, because they're next to each other, and then multiply by 4 afterwards. 

So here's my math:

First I do 5 + 2, which is 7.
Then I take that 7 and multiply it by 4.
7 times 4 is 28.

So if I do it like that, I think the answer is 28.","GPT Response: Oh, okay, so here's how I think about it. I know that multiplication is something like ""repeated addition,"" so if I have 2 times 4, that's like saying 2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 2, which is 8. Then I take that 8, and I add the 5 to it, because that's just like counting up from 8. So 8 plus 5 would be... let's see, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: Oh, I think you just do the math from left to right like reading a book. So first, I take 5 plus 2 which is 7, and then I take that 7 and multiply it by 4 which is 28. So, I think the answer is 28. 

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Oh! I think I can add numbers together. My teacher said that when there are different things to do in math, like adding and multiplying, there's a special order to follow, but I don't really remember it right now. But I do know how to add and multiply on their own!

So, I think I'll just do this from left to right because that's how I read. I'll do the adding first because it comes first:

5 + 2 = 7

Now I've got 7, and then I need to multiply by 4:

7 * 4 = 28

So, when I just do it from left to right, my answer is 28. But I've heard that sometimes there're rules that might change the answer. I guess I'll learn more about it in school soon!

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Okay, since I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I might just solve this from left to right, like I read a book! So I would add 5 and 3 first, because they're next to each other, and then multiply by 2 afterwards. 

So here's my thinking:

First I do 5 + 3, which is 8, and then I take that answer and multiply it by 2.

So now I have 8 * 2, which is 16.

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Oh, okay, so here's how I think about it. I know that multiplication is something like repeated addition. So, if I have 3 times 2, that's like saying 3 plus 3, which is 6. Then I just have to add that to 5. So it's like 5 plus 6, which equals 11. 

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Oh, I think you just do the math from left to right like reading a book. So first, you take 5 plus 3 which is 8, and then you multiply it by 2. 8 times 2 is 16!

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Oh! I think I can do this. So first, I'll do the adding part because it's the first thing in the question. So 5 plus 3 is 8, and then I take that 8 and multiply by 2 because that's what comes after.

So 8 times 2 is 16!
The answer is 16."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Oh, so I've heard my teacher mention something about doing multiplication before addition when working on math problems. I think there's a special order I'm supposed to follow to get it right. I remember it's like you do parentheses first, then exponents if there are any, then multiplication and division from left to right, and finally, addition and subtraction also from left to right.

Since there are no parentheses or exponents here, I only need to focus on multiplication and addition.

Alright, let's do multiplication first:

7 times 2 equals 14.
8 times 5 equals 40.

Now it looks like this:

14 + 40

Then, I do the addition:

14 plus 40 equals 54.

So, I think the final answer is correct when I do the steps in that order. The answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, I will multiply 7 by 2, which is 14.
Next, I will multiply 8 by 5, which is 40.
After that, I will add 14 and 40 together.
So, 14 + 40 equals 54.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Well, since I don't know about the order of operations, I might just do it from left to right like I read a book! So, I will multiply 7 by 2 first, which is 14, and then add 8 times 5.

So, 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40. 

Now, I just add 14 and 40 together!

14 + 40 equals 54.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: I think you just add and multiply in the order you see. So, I'll multiply 7 by 2 first, which is 14. Then, multiply 8 by 5, which is 40. And then you add them together, so 14 plus 40 is 54.

The answer is 54."
