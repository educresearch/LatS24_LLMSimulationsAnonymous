gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Uh, okay, I guess I need to figure out how to do this step by step. I remember my teacher mentioning something about doing stuff in brackets first... So maybe I'll start with that.

So there's this thing in brackets, (2+5), I'll add that up first:
2 + 5 = 7

Now I replace that part in parentheses with 7, so it looks like this now:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I think I have to do multiplication before addition and subtraction, so I'll do 4 times 7 and 2 times 3 next:
4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Okay, putting those numbers back into the equation:
28 + 12 - 6

Now I'll just add and subtract in the order they appear:
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So I think the answer is 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Oh, I remember my teacher mentioning this! We need to follow the order of operations, which means we have to do the calculations inside the parentheses first, then do multiplication and division from left to right, and finally, we do addition and subtraction from left to right.

So, let's break this down:

First, we calculate what's inside the parentheses, which is (2+5):
2 + 5 = 7

Now we replace that in the original problem:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we do the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Replacing these in the problem, we get:
28 + 12 - 6

Now, we just have addition and subtraction left:
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So the final answer is:
The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Well, since I don't know about order of operations called PEMDAS, I might just do the math from left to right! 

First, I'll say 4 times something, so I'll look inside the parentheses 'cause it seems important and add 2 plus 5 to get 7. Then I'd multiply 4 times 7 to get 28.

After that, I'd just continue adding and subtracting from left to right, because I don't know I'm supposed to do anything different!

So my math would look like this:

28 (from 4 times 7) + 12 equals 40. Then subtract 2, so that's 38. 

And then multiply 3 by 2, which equals 6. But since I'm supposed to subtract that, I'd do 38 - 6 to get 32.

So in my way of doing it, I get the answer:

The answer is 32.","GPT Response: Okay! I learned about this in math class. The teacher told us to remember ""PEMDAS."" It stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, I do what's in the parentheses. So I add 2+5 and that's 7. Now the problem looks like this:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Now I do the multiplications because they come before addition and subtraction. 

So 4 times 7 is 28, and 2 times 3 is 6. The problem now looks like this:

28 + 12 - 6

Now I just add and then subtract because there is no more multiplication or division left. So I add 28 and 12 first, which equals 40. The question now looks like:

40 - 6

And then I subtract 6 from 40, which is 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Oh, I think I'm supposed to do something with the multiplication and addition, but I'm not sure exactly what... I'll just try adding first, then multiplying, because that's how I read it from left to right.

So if I add 3 + 2 first, that gives me 5, and then if I multiply that by 4, that means I have 4 * 5, which equals 20.

The answer is 20.","GPT Response: To solve this math problem, I just follow the operations from left to right. So first, I'll multiply 4 by 3, and then I'll add 2 to the result.

4 multiplied by 3 is 12.

Now, I'll add 2 to 12.

12 plus 2 is 14.

So the answer is 14.","GPT Response: Oh, I just learned that when you see numbers and plus signs and times signs, you can just go from left to right like reading a book! So, I'll do that. First, I see 4 times 3, which is like 4 groups of 3. So that's 3, 6, 9, 12. Then I just have to add 2 to that. So 12 plus 2 is like having 12 cookies and getting 2 more, which makes 14 cookies! 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Oh, so I think we just do this one step at a time from left to right, like we read! First, we do 4 times 3 which is 12. Then we add the 2. So, 12 plus 2 equals 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Oh, I think I'm supposed to do something with the multiplication before adding the numbers. My teacher mentioned that there's a special order to follow for math problems. If I remember correctly, I should multiply before I add. So, I'll do the multiplication part first:

2 * 4 equals 8.

And then, I'll add that to 5:

5 + 8 equals 13.

So, my final answer to this problem would be:

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: To solve this math problem, I know I need to do the multiplication part first before the addition. This is what my teacher taught me in math class. So I need to multiply 2 by 4 first, and then add the result to 5. 

2 * 4 = 8

After I have done the multiplication, the problem looks like this:

5 + 8

Now I just need to add 5 and 8 together:

5 + 8 = 13

So the final answer is 13. 

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: Oh, I just learned addition and multiplication. So if I were to solve 5+2*4, I would do the adding part first because that's what I learned first. So it would be like this:

First I add 5 + 2, which is 7.
Then I multiply that by 4, so 7 times 4 is 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Oh, so when we do math with addition and multiplication, my teacher told me that I should do the multiplication part before I do the addition part. It's like a rule that helps us figure out the problem the same way every time. So first, I have to multiply 2 and 4 together.

Let's multiply:
2 * 4 = 8

Now, I take that answer and add the 5 to it:

5 + 8 = 13

So, the answer is 13."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Oh, I think I'm supposed to do something with the multiplication before adding the numbers. My teacher mentioned that there's a special order to follow for these kind of math problems. Okay, so if I multiply 3 times 2 first, that gives me 6, and then I add the 5 to that result. So, 5 plus 6 equals 11. So I believe the answer is...

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: To solve this math problem, I know I need to do the multiplication part first before the addition. This is what my teacher taught me in math class. So I need to multiply 3 by 2 first, and then add the 5.

Now, I add that result to 5:
5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Oh, I just learned that when you see numbers and plus signs and times signs, you just go from left to right, like reading! So first I see 5 plus 3, which is 8, and then times 2 must mean I have 8 two times. So 8 two times is 8 plus 8. And that's 16!

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Oh, so I think we just do this one step at a time from left to right, like we read! First, we add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then we take the 8 and multiply it by 2. Eight times two is 16. So, I think that means the answer is 16. 

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Oh, I think I remember my teacher saying something about doing multiplication before addition. Let's try that. 

First, I'll do the multiplication parts:
7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now I have to add those up:
14 + 40 = 54

So, I think that makes the final answer 54.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, I know that when you do math problems, you should do the multiplication parts before you do the adding parts. So I'll do the two multiplication problems first.

7 times 2 is 14.

8 times 5 is 40.

Now I have these numbers: 14 and 40.

Then I add the two numbers together.

14 plus 40 is 54.

So, the answer is 54.","GPT Response: Oh, I'm not sure what order to do things in, but I think you might just do the things as they come. So I would multiply 7 by 2 first because it's the first thing I see. That's 14. Then I add 8 because that's next, which makes 22. Then, I'd multiply by 5 because that's the last thing there! So 22 times 5... I might need to do that on paper or use my fingers.

Okay, 22 times 5... I think that's 110! So if I just go in order, my answer would be 110! 

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: Since I'm in elementary school and I haven't learned about the order of operations yet, I might just solve this from left to right like this:

First, 7 times 2 is 14.
Then I have 14 plus 8, which is 22.
Finally, 22 times 5 is 110.

So I think the answer is 110."
