      <td>GPT Response: Oh, order of operations! I think my teacher just talked about this. So, we're supposed to do the math in a special order so everyone gets the same answer. First, we do what's inside the parentheses, then any multiplication or division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right. I remember because my teacher said "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally" for PEMDAS.<br><br>So, first do what's inside the parentheses:<br>2 + 5 is 7.<br><br>Then we multiply because that comes before addition and subtraction:<br>4 * 7 is 28.<br><br>Now we just add and subtract from left to right:<br>28 + 12 is 40.<br>40 - (2*3) is 40 - 6 because we do the multiplication before subtraction.<br><br>Now subtract:<br>40 - 6 is 34.<br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, since I'm a student in grade 6 and just starting to learn about order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, let me explain what that means. PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>So based on that order, we should start with the parentheses first. Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5. <br><br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Then we do the multiplication next because it comes before addition and subtraction in PEMDAS.<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br><br>Now we perform the operations from left to right, dealing with the multiplication and then the addition and subtraction:<br><br>28 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Now, we do the next multiplication:<br><br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>And then we continue with addition and subtraction from left to right:<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>Putting it all together, we get:<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, since I don't know about the order of operations yet, I might just solve this from left to right like I read a book. So I'd do:<br><br>First I'd multiply 4 with the number right next to it because multiplication seems important:<br>4 * 2 equals 8.<br><br>Then I see a plus and I add 5:<br>8 + 5 equals 13.<br><br>Next, there is another plus, so I add 12:<br>13 + 12 equals 25.<br><br>Then I see a minus sign, so I subtract 2:<br>25 - 2 equals 23.<br><br>Then there's that multiplication again, so I do 3 times 2:<br>3 * 2 equals 6.<br><br>And then I end with another subtraction because it comes last in the equation:<br>23 - 6 equals 17.<br><br>So, I might think that the answer is 17. <br><br>The answer is 17.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: So, first, I have to do the math inside the parentheses because my teacher told me to do that before anything else. So 2 plus 5 equals 7. <br><br>Then, I need to do the multiplication parts before the addition and subtraction because that's another rule. So I take that 7 and multiply it by 4, which is 28.<br><br>Now I do the other multiplication, which is 2 times 3, and that equals 6.<br><br>So what I have now is 28 plus 12 minus 6.<br><br>Then, my teacher said to solve it from left to right like reading a book, doing addition and subtraction. So 28 plus 12 is 40, and then I take away 6 from 40, which is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>4*3 + 2</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I haven't learned about the order of operations yet, I might just solve the problem from left to right as I read it. So, first I'd multiply 4 by 3, which is 12. Then I'd add 2 to that result. So it would look like this:<br><br>First, 4 times 3 equals 12.<br>Then, 12 plus 2 equals 14.<br><br>So, if I just follow from left to right, my final answer would be:<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm a grade 6 student who doesn't know about order of operations, I'd try to solve this by going from left to right, just like reading a book.<br><br>First, I see 4 times 3, which I know is 12, because 4 groups of 3 make 12. Then, I see there's a plus sign and a 2, so I need to add that to the 12 I already got. So,<br><br>12 (that's 4 times 3) plus 2 equals 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, I think you just do it from left to right like reading a book! So first I will multiply 4 times 3 which is 12. And then I add 2 to that. So 12 plus 2 is 14!<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! So when we do math, we should do the times part first because it's like having a bunch of groups, and then we can add more after we know how big our groups are! So first, I will multiply 4 times 3. <br><br>4 times 3 is just like having 4 groups of 3 things. So if I count all of them, it's 3, 6, 9, 12. Now I have 12. <br><br>Now I just need to add 2 to it. So if I have 12 things and get 2 more, that makes 12... 13, 14!<br><br>So the answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Umm, so I'm not sure about the special rules, but I think maybe you do the multiplication part first? Because I heard someone saying that multiplication goes before adding. So what I would do is first multiply 2 and 4 which is 8, and then I would add 5 to that. So 5 plus 8 is 13. So I think the answer is 13. The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about order of operations or PEMDAS, I would solve this problem the way I see it, just going from left to right. So I would first add 5 + 2 to get 7, and then multiply that result by 4. So that would be 7 * 4, which is 28.<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, I think you just do it from left to right like reading a book! So first I will add 5 plus 2 which is 7. And then I multiply 7 by 4 which is 28. <br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, so when we do math with adding and times (multiplication), my teacher said that we have to do the times part first before we add. So first we do 2 times 4 which is like 2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 2. That makes 8!<br><br>Then we take that 8 and we have to add the 5 to it. So it's like if you have 5 candies and you get 8 more candies, then you count them all together. So 5 plus 8 is 13! <br><br>So if I did it right, then the answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think I've seen my older sister do these kinds of problems! She told me that when there are different things to do like multiplying and adding, I should do the multiplying part first. So I would first multiply 3 by 2, which is 6. Then I just add that to 5.<br><br>So, 5 + 3*2 becomes 5 + 6 when I do the multiplying part first. Then I add 5 and 6 together and I get 11. <br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
