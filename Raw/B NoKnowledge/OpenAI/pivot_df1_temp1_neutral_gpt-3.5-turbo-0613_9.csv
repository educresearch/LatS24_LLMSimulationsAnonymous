gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2*4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to remember that in Mathematics, there is a specific order called ""order of operations"" that we follow. The order of operations tells us which calculations to do first. 

In this case, we have addition and multiplication. According to the order of operations, multiplication should be done before addition. So, we need to do the multiplication first. 

2 multiplied by 4 is equal to 8. 

Then, we add 8 to 5. 

The answer is 13."

gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, we need to solve the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, there is 2+5, which equals 7. 
Then we have 4*(7)+12-2*3. Next, we need to solve the multiplication and division from left to right. 
Starting with 4*(7), we get 28. So now we have 28+12-2*3. 
Next, we solve the multiplication of 2*3, which equals 6. 
So now we have 28+12-6. 
Lastly, we solve the addition and subtraction from left to right. 
Starting with 28+12, we get 40. So now we have 40-6. 
Finally, we solve 40-6, which gives us 34.
