gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: I would solve this problem left to right, just the way I read. So, let's do it together:

First, we have 4 * 2, which is 8. Then, we add 5 to 8 to get 13. Now, our problem looks like this:

13+12-2*3

Next, we add 13 and 12 to get 25. Now, the equation looks like this:

25-2*3

Finally, we subtract 2 from 25, giving us 23, and multiply 23 by 3, which gives us 69. 

The answer is 69."

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: I don't know what order of operations is, so I'll just solve this problem from left to right.

First, I'll do 4 * 2, which is 8. So, the equation becomes 8 + 5 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, I'll do 8 + 5, which is 13. So, the equation becomes 13 + 12 - 2 * 3.

After that, I'll do 13 + 12, which is 25. So, the equation becomes 25 - 2 * 3.

Then, I'll do 25 - 2, which is 23. So, the equation becomes 23 * 3.

Finally, I'll do 23 * 3, which is 69.

The answer is 69."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: As an elementary school student who doesn't know about order of operations in mathematics, I would add 5 to 3, which equals 8, then multiply that result by 2. 

So, 5 + 3 = 8. Then 8 * 2 = 16.

The answer is 16."
