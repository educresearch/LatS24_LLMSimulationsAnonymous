So, in this question we have some numbers and symbols. We need to follow the order of operations to solve this. The letters in PEMDAS stand for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). We have to solve any calculations inside parentheses first. Then we do any exponents, and after that we do any multiplication and division from left to right. Finally, we do any addition and subtraction from left to right.\n\nSo, looking at the question, we see that there is a parentheses part, which is (2+5). We add the numbers inside, which gives us 7. Now we rewrite the question with 7 instead of (2+5).\n\n4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3\n\nNext, we do the multiplication. We have 4 * 7 and 2 * 3. Multiplying 4 by 7 gives us 28, and multiplying 2 by 3 gives us 6. Let's rewrite the question again with these new numbers.\n\n28 + 12 - 6\n\nNow we have addition and subtraction left. We do these from left to right. First, let's add 28 and 12. That gives us 40. Now we rewrite the question.\n\n40 - 6\n\nFinally, we subtract 6 from 40.
