gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, we need to solve the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we add 2 and 5, which equals 7. So now the problem looks like this: 4*7+12-2*3.

Next, we need to perform the multiplications. We multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28, and we multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. Now the problem is: 28+12-6.

Finally, we can perform the additions. We add 28 and 12, which equals 40, and then subtract 6. So the final answer is 40-6.

The answer is 34."

gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will use my knowledge of the order of operations. According to my understanding, I just need to go from left to right and perform the operations as I see them. 

So first, I see that I need to multiply 2 by 4. This gives me 8. 

Then, I add 5 to the result of the multiplication. 

Therefore, my final answer is 13. 

The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will follow the order of operations, which is a rule that tells us what operations to do first. In the order of operations, multiplication is done before addition. 

So, I will first multiply 7 by 2, which gives me 14. 

Then, I will multiply 8 by 5, which gives me 40. 

Finally, I will add 14 and 40 to get the final answer. 

The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we follow the order of operations called ""PEMDAS"". P stands for parenthesis, E stands for exponents or powers, MD stands for multiplication and division (from left to right), and AS stands for addition and subtraction (from left to right).

In this equation, there are no parentheses or exponents. So, we move to the multiplication and division part. Since there's only one operation, which is multiplication, we perform it first.

4 * 3 = 12

After performing the multiplication, we move to the addition and subtraction part. Again, there's only one operation, which is addition.

12 + 2 = 14

Therefore, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, we need to solve what is in parentheses. In the parentheses, we add 2 and 5, which equals 7. 
Next, we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. 
Then, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which equals 6. 
Finally, we add 12 to 28 and subtract 6 from the sum. 
Therefore, the answer is 34."

gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I would start by looking at the numbers and symbols in the expression. I see a plus sign (+) and a multiplication sign (*). I would remember that multiplication comes before addition, so I would do the multiplication first. 

To multiply, I would multiply 2 by 4 to get 8. 

Then, I would add 5 to the result of the multiplication. 5 + 8 is 13.
