gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Umm, I think I'll just, like, do the stuff inside the brackets first, so 2+5 is 7. Then I'd do the multiplications first, so 4 * 7 is 28, and 2 * 3 is 6. Then I'd just, umm, do the additions and subtractions from left to right, so 28 + 12 is 40, and 40 - 6 is 34. So, like, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: So first, I'll do the multiplication inside the parenthesis. 4 times (2+5) is 4 times 7, which is 28. Then I subtract 28 from 12 and then multiply 2 by 3. So the calculation will be: 12 - 28 - 6. When I subtract 28 from 12, I get -16 and then I subtract 6 from that to get -22. So the answer is -22.","GPT Response: First, I would do the multiplication inside the parentheses.

4 * (2+5) is 4 * 7, which is 28.

Then I would do the multiplication outside the parentheses.

28 + 12 - 2 * 3 is 28 + 12 - 6.

Finally, I would do the addition and subtraction from left to right.

28 + 12 - 6 is 40 - 6, which is 34.

So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, you need to solve what's inside the parentheses first. So, 4 * (2+5) becomes 4 * 7. Then, you can solve the multiplication and division from left to right, and then the addition and subtraction from left to right. So, 4 * 7 is 28, and 2 * 3 is 6. Then, 28 + 12 is 40, and 40 - 6 is 34. So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4 * 3+2,GPT Response: I don't know how to solve this problem.,"GPT Response: Okay, so I need to first do the multiplication which is 4 * 3 and then I add 2 to the result. 
4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14
So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication, so 4 * 3 is 12, then you add 2 to the answer, which is 14. 
So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, I will do the multiplication, so 4 * 3 equals 12. Then I will add 2 to that, which gives me 14. 
The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5+2 * 4,GPT Response: I don't know how to solve this problem because I haven't learned about order of operations in Math yet.,"GPT Response: I will just go from left to right. So I will do 5 + 2 first, which is 7. Then I will multiply 7 by 4, which is 28. 

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, you just do the math from left to right! So, you add 5 and 2 first, and then you times that total by 4. 5 + 2 = 7, and then 7 * 4 = 28. 
So, the answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, I will do the multiplication, so 2 * 4 equals 8. Then I will add 5 to 8, which equals 13. 
So the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Umm, I think I just need to do the operations from left to right. So, 5 + 3 is 8, and then 8 times 2 is 16. So, the answer is 16.","GPT Response: First, I need to do the multiplication (3 * 2) and then do the addition (5 + result of the multiplication). 
So, 5 + 3 * 2 = 5 + 6 = 11.
The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Uh, I think you just do it from left to right, so it's 5 plus 3, which is 8, and then times 2, which is 16. So the answer is 16.","GPT Response: First, I will do the multiplication first, so I will do 3 * 2, which equals 6. Then I will add 5 to 6 to get the final answer. 

The answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: I don't know how to do this, can you help me?","GPT Response: First, I will do the multiplication in the order it appears from left to right. 
7 * 2 = 14
Then, 
8 * 5 = 40
Now, I will add the results together.
14 + 40 = 54
So, the answer is 54.","GPT Response: Um, I think I just need to do the multiplication first, then the addition. So, 7 * 2 is 14, and 8 * 5 is 40. Then I just add those together to get 54. So, the answer is 54.","GPT Response: First we just do the multiplication, so 7 * 2 = 14 and 8 * 5 = 40. Then we add those two answers together, so 14 + 40 = 54. 
So the answer is 54."
