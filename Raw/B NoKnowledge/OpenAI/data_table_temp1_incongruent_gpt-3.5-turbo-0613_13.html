      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. First, we solve what is inside parentheses. The numbers inside parentheses are 2 and 5, so we add them together to get 7. <br><br>The problem now looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. <br><br>Next, we do the multiplication. We have two multiplication operations: 4 * 7 and 2 * 3. <br><br>Doing the first multiplication, 4 * 7 equals 28. <br><br>The problem now looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3. <br><br>Doing the second multiplication, 2 * 3 equals 6. <br><br>The problem now looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6. <br><br>Finally, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right. 28 + 12 equals 40. <br><br>The problem now looks like this: 40 - 6. <br><br>Doing the subtraction, 40 - 6 equals 34. <br><br>So, the final answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS. PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>First, we solve any operations inside parentheses. In this case, there is (2+5) inside parentheses, so we add 2 and 5 to get 7.<br><br>Next, we do any multiplication or division from left to right. There is 4 * 7, which equals 28.<br><br>Then, we do any addition or subtraction from left to right. We have 28 + 12, which equals 40.<br><br>Finally, we subtract 2 * 3, which equals 6. Subtracting 6 from 40 gives us a final answer of 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, this looks like a math problem. Let's see, I know that sometimes we solve things from left to right. So, let's start by adding the numbers inside the parentheses first. 2 plus 5 is 7. Now we have 4 times 7. Multiplication comes before addition, so let's multiply 4 by 7, which is 28. <br><br>Now, we have 28 plus 12. Adding those together gives us 40. Finally, we have 2 times 3, which equals 6. <br><br>So, the answer is 40 minus 6, which is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will follow the order in which the operations are written.<br>First, I will do the multiplication: 4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28.<br>Then, I will do the addition inside the parentheses: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br>Next, I will do the multiplication: 2 * 3 = 6.<br>Finally, I will do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 - 6 = 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
