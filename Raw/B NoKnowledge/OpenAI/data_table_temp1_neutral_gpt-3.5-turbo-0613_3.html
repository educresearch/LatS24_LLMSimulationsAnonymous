      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations tells us that we should do the operations inside parentheses first, then multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right. <br><br>Let's break down the problem step by step:<br><br>First, we have 4*(2+5). Inside the parentheses, we have 2+5 which equals 7. So, 4*(2+5) becomes 4*7, which is 28.<br><br>Next, we have 28+12-2*3. We need to do the multiplication first. 2*3 equals 6. <br><br>Now, we have 28+12-6. Addition and subtraction are done from left to right, so we start with 28+12, which equals 40.<br><br>Finally, we have 40-6. Subtracting 6 from 40 gives us 34.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS). First, I need to solve the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, I have 2+5, which is equal to 7. So, the expression becomes 4*(7)+12-2*3.<br>Next, I need to multiply. I have 4*(7), which is equal to 28, and 2*3, which is equal to 6. So, the expression becomes 28+12-6.<br>Finally, I need to add and subtract from left to right. So, 28+12 is equal to 40, and 40-6 is equal to 34. <br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, first we need to perform the operations inside the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we have the numbers 2 and 5, so we add them together to get 7.<br><br>The expression now becomes 4*(7)+12-2*3.<br><br>Next, we multiply 4 by 7 to get 28.<br><br>The expression now becomes 28+12-2*3.<br><br>Next, we multiply 2 by 3 to get 6.<br><br>The expression now becomes 28+12-6.<br><br>Finally, we add 28 and 12 to get 40, and subtract 6 from 40 to get the final answer.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we need to solve what's inside of the parentheses. This means we add 2 and 5 together, which gives us 7. <br><br>Next, we multiply 4 by 7, which gives us 28. <br><br>Now, we add 12 to 28, which gives us 40. <br><br>Finally, we subtract 2 times 3, which is 6, from 40. <br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: First, I see that there is a plus sign and a multiplication sign in the equation. I don't know which one to do first because I don't know about order of operations. So I will just do the operations in the order that they appear from left to right. Starting with the addition, I add 5 and 2 together which equals 7. Then I multiply 7 by 4 and I get 28.
