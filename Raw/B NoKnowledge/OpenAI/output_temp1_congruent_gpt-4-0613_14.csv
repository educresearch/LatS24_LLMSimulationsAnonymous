systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Since I'm an elementary school student and I don't know about the order of operations, I'll just solve it from left to right! So, first, I'd do 5 + 3 which equals 8. And then, I'd multiply that answer by 2. So, 8 * 2 equals 16!
The answer is 16."
