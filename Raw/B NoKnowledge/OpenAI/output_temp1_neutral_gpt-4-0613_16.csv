systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Well, I haven't learned about order of operations (whatever that is). Because of this, I will just solve the problem starting from the left to the right.

First, I will take 5 plus 3 which equals 8. Then, I will take that 8 and multiply it by 2, and get 16.

The answer is 16."
