gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Oh, I think I'm supposed to do something with the multiplication before adding. My friend told me that when you solve math problems, you have to do the times thing before the plus thing. So that means I should do 2 times 4 first, which is 8, and then add the 5 to that. So, 5 plus 8 equals 13. So I guess the answer is...

The answer is 13."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Oh, order of operations? I think my older sibling mentioned that when you do math problems, you have to do some things before others. Let's see, I think you're supposed to do multiplication before you add things together.

So first, I would multiply 7 and 2, which I know is 14 because 7 plus 7 is 14.

Then, I would multiply 8 and 5. Well, I know that 8 times 5 is 40 because 8 times 10 is 80 and then I just cut that in half.

Now I can add those two answers together - 14 and 40. 

So 14 plus 40 is... umm, I can make it 10 plus 40 which is 50, and then add the 4 left over to get 54.

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Oh, I think I'm supposed to do something with the multiplication and addition, but I'm not sure exactly what... My older sister mentioned once that I should do something called ""multiplication before addition"". So following that, I should multiply 4 and 3 first, which gives 12, and then add 2. Alright, let's do that:

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

So I think the answer is 14. The answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Oh, I remember my teacher talking about something like this. They said we have to do the math problems in a special order so everyone gets the same answer. I think they said to do what's inside the parentheses first.

So let's see what we have here:

4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3

First, I'm going to do the adding inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

Now the problem looks like this:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I think we're supposed to do the multiplication before we do any adding or subtracting. So let's do that:

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Then we put those back into the problem:
28 + 12 - 6

Now we just add and subtract in order from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So the final answer is:
The answer is 34."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Oh, I think I'm supposed to do something with the multiplication before adding. My friend told me that when you see multiplication and addition, you do the multiplication first. Let me try it that way.

So I'm going to multiply 3 and 2 first. That is 3 times 2 which equals 6. Now, I have 5 plus 6.

Now I can add 5 to 6, which equals 11.

So the answer is 11."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: To solve this math problem, I know I need to do the multiplication part first before the addition. This is what my teacher taught me in math class. So I need to multiply 2 by 4 first, and then add the result to 5. 

2 * 4 = 8

After I have done the multiplication, the problem looks like this:

5 + 8

Now I just need to add 5 and 8 together:

5 + 8 = 13

So the final answer is 13. 

The answer is 13."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Oh, I heard from my teacher about a rule for solving this kind of math problem. It's called ""order of operations"" and it says I'm supposed to do multiplication before addition. I remember because it's like the word PEMDAS! That stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction, and multiplication is before addition.

So first I need to multiply 7 times 2, which is 14.

Then I multiply 8 times 5, which is 40.

Now I add those two results together: 14 + 40.

When I add 14 and 40, I get 54.

So the final answer is 54."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this math problem, I just follow the operations from left to right. First, I multiply, and then I add.

So, I multiply 4 by 3, which is 12. Then, I add 2 to that, so it becomes 12 + 2. When I add those together, I get 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Okay, I may not know the fancy term ""PEMDAS"" or anything, but my math teacher says that when we have a math problem with different things like multiplying, adding and subtracting, we should do what's inside the parentheses first. So let's start with that.

So first, I will add the numbers inside the parentheses (2 + 5), which gives us 7.

Now we have: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, my teacher also said that we have to do multiplication before addition and subtraction. So let's multiply:

4 times 7 equals 28.

2 times 3 equals 6.

Now our math problem looks like this:

28 + 12 - 6

Then we just do the adding and subtracting from left to right.

28 plus 12 equals 40.

Then take that 40 and subtract 6, which gives us 34.

So, the final answer is: The answer is 34."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: To solve this math problem, I need to follow a rule called the order of operations. The order of operations says that I should do multiplication before addition. So I need to multiply 3 by 2 first, and then add the result to 5.

First, I do the multiplication:
3 * 2 = 6

Now, I have the result of the multiplication. Next, I add that to 5:
5 + 6 = 11

So, the final answer is 11.
The answer is 11."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Oh, I just learned that when you see numbers and plus signs and times signs, you can just go from left to right like reading a book! So, I'll just do that.

First, I see a 5 and then a plus sign and a 2, so I'll add those together first. That makes 7, because 5 plus 2 is 7. Then I see the times sign and a 4, so I'll multiply the 7 by the 4. 7 times 4 is 28!

So, I think the answer is 28. The answer is 28."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Oh, I just learned about multiplication and addition! I think I should just do the math from left to right, like reading a book. So, I'll first do 7 times 2 which is 14, then I'll add the next number, 8, and that makes 22. Then I multiply 22 with the next number, 5, so that gives me... hmm, 110.

So, the answer is 110."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Oh, I just learned this! My teacher said that when we have a math problem like this, we should do the multiplying part first and then add. So I'll first do 4 times 3, which is 12, and then I'll add 2 to that. So 12 plus 2 is 14. Therefore, the answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Since I haven't learned about order of operations yet, I'll just do things step by step from left to right like I would read a book!

First, I'll multiply 4 with the numbers in the parentheses because it looks like they're a team, so 4 times (2 + 5):
- 2 plus 5 equals 7.
- Now multiply 4 times 7 which equals 28.

So, I have 28, and then I need to add 12, which makes:
- 28 plus 12 equals 40.

Now I just have to subtract 2 times 3 from 40:
- 2 times 3 equals 6.
- 40 minus 6 equals 34.

So I think the answer is 34! The answer is 34."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Oh, I just learned that when you see numbers and plus signs and times signs, you can just go from left to right like reading a book! So, I'll just do that.

First, I see a 5 and then a plus sign and a 3, so I'll add those together first. That makes 8, because 5 plus 3 is 8. Then I see the times sign and a 2, so I'll do the next part which is 8 times 2. And 8 times 2 is 16!

So if I do it this way, the answer is 16."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Oh, so I think we just do this one step at a time from left to right, like we read! First, we add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then we take the 7 and multiply it by 4. So 7 times 4 is 28. So that means the answer is 28! 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Okay, so since I don't know about the order of operations, I might just calculate this step by step from left to right. So first, I'd do 7 times 2 which is 14. Then I'd add 8 and get 22. After that, I'd multiply 22 with 5 to get 110. So, using what I know, I'd say:

The answer is 110."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Oh, so I think we just need to do the math step by step from left to right, like how we read a book, right? So first, we do 4 times 3 which is like 4 plus 4 plus 4, and that gives us 12. Then we just add 2 to that. So, 12 plus 2 is like having 12 cookies and getting 2 more cookies which makes 14 cookies in total! 

Therefore, the answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, I know I need to do the stuff in the parentheses. So that's, 2 plus 5, which is 7. Then I have to multiply that by 4 because it is right next to the parentheses, so that's like 4 groups of 7. That's 28.

Now, the problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2*3. Next, I need to do the multiplication part before I add or subtract anything else. So 2 times 3 is 6.

So after that step, it's 28 plus 12 minus 6. Now we just have addition and subtraction left, and I can just go from left to right. So I add 28 and 12 first, which gives me 40. Then I subtract 6 from 40, which is 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Oh, so I think we just do this one step at a time from left to right, like we read! First, we add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then we take the 8 and multiply it by 2. Eight times two is 16. So, I think that means the answer is 16!

The answer is 16."
