systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. We start with the parentheses first, so we add 2 and 5, which gives us 7. Then we multiply 4 by the result, so we have 4 * 7 which equals 28. 
Next, we add 12 to 28, which gives us 40. 
Finally, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3 from 40. 
So the answer is 40 - (2 * 3) which is 40 - 6. 
Therefore, the answer is 34."
