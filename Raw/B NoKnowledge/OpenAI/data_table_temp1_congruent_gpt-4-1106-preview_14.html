      <td>GPT Response: So, I think we need to do the adding and multiplying in a special order. I remember my teacher saying something about doing what's inside the parentheses first before we do the multiplying or anything else.<br><br>Okay, so first I see there are parentheses with "2 + 5" inside. I'll add those numbers together first. So 2 + 5 equals 7.<br><br>Now the problem looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. <br><br>Next, I think we need to do the multiplying before adding and subtracting. So I'll multiply 4 times 7 which is 28.<br><br>Then we also have 2 times 3 at the end, which is 6.<br><br>Now the problem is 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Then we do the adding and subtracting from left to right. So first, I'll add 28 and 12 which equals 40.<br><br>Lastly, I subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34.<br><br>So, I think the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps for solving math problems that have different operations. So, first we need to do the operations inside the parentheses, then we do any multiplications or divisions, and last we do the additions and subtractions. Let's go step by step.<br><br>First, we solve what's inside the parentheses:<br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now we replace the result (7) back into the expression:<br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, we do the multiplications:<br>4 * 7 = 28<br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>So now we update our expression with these results:<br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>We finish by doing the addition and subtraction, from left to right:<br>28 + 12 = 40<br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So, our final answer is:<br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh cool, a math puzzle! So, I think we first have to do some math inside the brackets! Adding the numbers inside brackets sounds like a good start because we always use brackets to hold things together.<br><br>We have 2 plus 5 inside the brackets, so if I add those together, it's like adding two toys plus five toys, which gives us seven toys. So that bit turns into:<br><br>4 * 7<br><br>Then, there's this plus 12 and minus 2 times 3 left. Hmm, I've seen my older brother do this; we should do the multiplication before the adding and subtracting, cause I heard that's kinda like a rule.<br><br>So, I multiply 4 times 7, which is like having 4 groups of 7 things. When I count them all, I get 28. Then, I multiply the 2 times 3 because that's also multiplication, and that gives me 6.<br><br>Now it looks like this:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Adding 28 and 12 is like if I had 28 candies and I got 12 more, that's a lot of candies... Oh right! So I count them up and get 40 candies. Then if I had to give back 6 candies, I would take the 6 away from 40, which leaves me with:<br><br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So, after all that adding and subtracting, I get 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I think I should do the part inside the parentheses because it's like a mini math problem all by itself. So I'll do 2 plus 5 which is 7. Next, I have to do 4 times that 7, because the times sign is right next to the parentheses, so 4 times 7 is 28.<br><br>Now my problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2 times 3. I remember that I should do times before plus and minus. So I do 2 times 3 which is 6. <br><br>Then all I have left is 28 plus 12 minus 6. I'll add 28 and 12 first because they're next to each other and that makes 40. Finally, I take 40 and subtract 6 and that gives me 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hm, I'm not really sure about any special rules, but I think I would just go from left to right like I read a book! So first I would take 4 times 3 because that comes first, which I know is 12. Then I just add 2 to that because that's what comes next. So it's 12 plus 2, which is 14. <br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure about any fancy rules, but I think you just do the multiplication first because that's what I've seen people do. So first I'd do 4 times 3 which is 12. And then you just add the 2. So, 12 plus 2 is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations yet, I might just solve from left to right. So I would multiply 4 and 3 first because that's the first thing I see. <br><br>4 times 3 is 12, and then I would add 2 to that. So, 12 plus 2 equals 14. <br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, my teacher said that in math I need to do multiplication before I do addition, so I will do 4 times 3 first which is 12. After that, I add the 2 to the 12, which means 12 plus 2. So, 12 plus 2 is 14! <br><br>So, the answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure about the rules, but my older brother told me once that when there are different things to do in math, like adding and multiplying, thereâ€™s a special order you have to do them in. He said that you should do the multiplying part before the adding. <br><br>So, I guess I have to do the 2 times 4 first. That's 8. After that, I just need to add the 5. <br><br>5 + 8 equals 13. <br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations yet, I might just solve from left to right. So I would add 5 and 2 first, which is 7, and then multiply that by 4. So my answer would be 7 times 4 which is 28.<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
