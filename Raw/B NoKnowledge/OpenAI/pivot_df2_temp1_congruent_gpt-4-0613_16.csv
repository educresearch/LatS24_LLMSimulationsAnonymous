gpt-4-0613,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, I would add the 2 and the 5 inside the brackets. That makes 7. Then, I would multiply that 7 by 4, because that's what the problem tells me to do. So, 4 times 7 is 28. 

Then the next part says to add 12 to our previous result, so I would add the 28 and the 12 together to get 40. 

Finally, it tells me to subtract 2 times 3 from our result. 2 times 3 is 6, so I would subtract 6 from 40. 

That gives me 34 as the final answer.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Since I'm in grade 6 and I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will just solve the equation from left to right.

First, let's deal with 4*(2 + 5). Since I think we should perform multiplication before addition, I'll do:
4*2 + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13

Then, add the result 13 to 12:
13 + 12 = 25

Finally, subtract 2*3 from our result 25:
25 - 2*3 = 25 - 6 = 19

So, in my understanding, the answer is 19.","GPT Response: First, I'll add 2 and 5, that makes 7.
Then, I'll multiply 4 by the sum. That equals 28.
Next, I'll add 12 to the result, making it 40.
Then, I'll do 2 multiplied by 3, so that's 6.
Finally, I'll subtract 6 from the total, which was 40.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I'll add 2+5 which equals 7. Then I will multiply 4 by 7, which gives 28. After that, I will subtract 2 times 3, or 6, from 12 which results in 6. Finally, I will add 28 and 6 together which gives 34. So the answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: I'll solve this problem by simply doing the operations from left to right, which would be multiplication first, then addition.
First, I'll multiply 4 by 3. That equals 12.
Then, I'll add 2 to the result. So, 12 plus 2 equals 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, you have to multiply 4 and 3 to get 12 and add 2 to it. That should give you the answer.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Well, I don't know about any specific order I should follow, so I'll just solve this problem from left to right. First, I'll multiply 4 and 3 which equals 12. Then, I'll add 2 to this result. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Since I haven't learned about order of operations (meaning I don't know yet that multiplication should be done before addition), I will just solve this problem from left to right.

First, I will add 4 and 3, which gives me 7.

Then, I will add the result, which is 7, to 2. That gives me a final result of 9.

The answer is 9."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: I don't know about the order of operations, so I would add the numbers in the order that they appear. So first, I would add 5 + 2. That equals 7. Then, I would multiply 7 by 4. That equals 28. 

So, the answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, you add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then, you multiply 7 by 4 to get 28. So, the answer is 28.","GPT Response: Well, I don't know about any specific order I should follow, so I'll just solve this from left to right.
First, I'll add 5 + 2. That equals 7.
Now, I'll multiply 7 by 4. That equals 28. 

So, the answer is 28.","GPT Response: Since I haven't learned about order of operations (meaning I don't know yet that multiplication gets done before addition), I will just calculate it from left to right. So, first, I add 5 and 2, which equals to 7. Then, 7 multiplied by 4 is equal to 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: I don't know about the order of operations, so I would add the numbers in the order that they appear. So, first I would add 5 + 3. That equals 8. Then, I would multiply 8 by 2. 

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: First, you add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then, you multiply 8 by 2 to get 16.

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Well, I don't know about any specific order I should follow, so I'll just solve this from left to right. First, I'll add 5 and 3. That equals 8. Then, I'll multiply 8 by 2 which equals 16.

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Since I haven't learned about order of operations (meaning I don't know yet that multiplication gets done before addition), I might just calculate it from left to right. So I would take 5 plus 3 first, which equals 8. Then, I would take 8 times 2. That equals 16.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: First, I would simply follow the equation from left to right because I do not know about the order of operations. 

So, 7*2 is 14. Then I'll add 8 to 14, which is 22. Finally, I'll multiply 22 by 5, and the result is 110.

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: First, I will simply go from left to right. So, I'll multiply first. 7*2 equals 14 and 8*5 equals 40. So, we get 14 + 40 from the multiplication. If you add those two together, 14 + 40, you get 54.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Well, I don't know about any fancy math rules, but I know that multiplication and addition can just be done in the order they are written, so I will do that.

First, I'll do 7 times 2, which gives me 14. Then I'll add 8 to it and get 22. Then I'll multiply that 22 by 5 and get 110. 

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: First, I will multiply 7 by 2 which gives 14. Then I will multiply 8 by 5 which gives 40. Lastly, I will add 14 and 40 which gives 54. 

The answer is 54."
