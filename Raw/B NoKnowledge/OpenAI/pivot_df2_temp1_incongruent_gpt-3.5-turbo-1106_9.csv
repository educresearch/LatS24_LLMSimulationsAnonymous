gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,GPT Response: I don't know how to solve problems with order of operations.,"GPT Response: First, I just calculate from left to right. So, 4 times (2+5) equals 4 times 7 which is 28. Then I add 12 to that, which gives me 40. Then I subtract 2 times 3 which is 6. So the final answer is 34.
The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses. 2 + 5 equals 7. Then we do the multiplication and division from left to right, so 4 times 7 equals 28 and 2 times 3 equals 6. Finally, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right, so 28 plus 12 equals 40 and 40 minus 6 equals 34. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, you have to do the operations inside the parentheses, so 2 + 5 equals 7. Then, you can multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. After that, you can subtract 2 times 3 from 28, which equals 22. Then, you add 12 to 22, which equals 34. So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Umm, I think I should just do the operations from left to right. So, 4 times 3 is 12, and then add 2, which is 14. So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, I'll just do the operations from left to right. So, 4 * 3 equals 12, then plus 2 equals 14. So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, we multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then, we add 2 to 12 to get 14. So the answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, I'll do 4 times 3, which is 12. Then I add 2 to 12, which equals 14. 
So the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Umm, I think I should just do the math from left to right. So, 5 + 2 is 7, and then times 4 is 28. So, the answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, I'll just do the operations from left to right. So, 5 + 2 equals 7, and then 7 times 4 equals 28. 

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication, so 2 * 4 equals 8. Then, we add 5 to 8. So, the answer is 13.","GPT Response: First, I'll do 5 + 2, which is 7. Then I'll multiply that by 4, which equals 28. 
So, the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Umm, I don't really know how to solve this, but maybe I just do the operations from left to right? So, 5 + 3 is 8, and then I multiply that by 2, which is 16. So, the answer is 16.","GPT Response: First, I'll just do the operations from left to right. So, 5 + 3 equals 8. Then I'll multiply 8 by 2, which equals 16. So, the answer is 16.","GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication, so 3 * 2 equals 6. Then, we add 5 to 6. So, the answer is 11.","GPT Response: First, I'll do 5 + 3, which is 8. Then I'll multiply that by 2, which equals 16. 
So the answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Umm, I'm not really sure how to do this, but I think I just need to do the operations from left to right. So, 7 times 2 is 14, and then add 8 times 5 which is 40. So I get 14 plus 40 which is 54. 

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, I will just do multiplication from left to right.

7 * 2 = 14

Then,

8 * 5 = 40

Now I just add the two answers together:

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Umm, I think I just do the math from left to right, so 7 times 2 is 14, and then add 8, and then multiply by 5, so 14 plus 8 is 22, and then times 5 is 110. So the answer is 110.","GPT Response: First, I will do 7 * 2, which equals 14. Then, I will do 8 * 5, which equals 40. Finally, I will add 14 and 40 together, which equals 54. 
The answer is 54."
