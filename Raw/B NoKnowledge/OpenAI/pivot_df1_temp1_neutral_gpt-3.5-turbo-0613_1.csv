gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, you need to follow the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS. This stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, you solve the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.

Then, you perform the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28.

Next, you do any addition or subtraction: 28 + 12 = 40.

Finally, you perform the remaining multiplication: 2 * 3 = 6.

The answer is 40 - 6 = 34."

gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: To solve this math problem, I need to follow the order of operations. I'll start with the multiplication, which is 2 times 4. That gives me 8. Then, I add 5 to 8. So, the answer is 13.
The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to follow the order of operations, which is always doing multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. 
First, I see that there are two multiplication operations: 7*2 and 8*5. 
So, I will multiply 7 by 2 which equals 14, and multiply 8 by 5 which equals 40.
Now, I have the two products: 14 and 40. 
Lastly, I will add the two products together, which is 14 + 40.
The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this math problem, I need to follow the order of operations. I'll start by multiplying 4 and 3 together, which equals 12. Then, I'll add the result of 12 to 2, which equals 14. 
The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to follow the order of operations. I don't know what that is, so I'll just solve it from left to right.

First, I'll calculate 4*(2+5). That is 4*7, which is 28.

Next, I'll add 12 to that. So, 28 + 12 is 40.

Then, I'll subtract 2*3. That is 6.

Finally, I'll subtract 6 from 40. So, 40 - 6 is 34.

The answer is 34."

gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will start by multiplying 2 and 4 because that's the operation that comes first in the equation. 2 times 4 equals 8. Then, I will add 5 to this result. 5 plus 8 equals 13. 
So, the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: First, we need to start with the numbers inside parentheses, but there aren't any here. Next, we look for any exponents, but there aren't any of those either. Then, we do any multiplication or division from left to right. So, we first multiply 7 by 2, which equals 14. Then, we multiply 8 by 5, which equals 40. Finally, we add these two results together. So, 14 plus 40 equals 54. The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will start by multiplying 4 and 3 together to get 12. Then, I will add 2 to find the final answer.

gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Hmm, this looks like a tricky math problem! Okay, let's take it step by step.

First, we need to solve what's in the parentheses. So, we have 2 + 5, which equals 7. 

Next, we have to multiply 4 by 7. So, 4 multiplied by 7 equals 28.

Now, we have 28 + 12. So, we add 28 and 12 to get 40.

Finally, we have to subtract 2 multiplied by 3. 2 multiplied by 3 equals 6. 

So, the final step is subtracting 6 from 40. 

The answer is 34."
