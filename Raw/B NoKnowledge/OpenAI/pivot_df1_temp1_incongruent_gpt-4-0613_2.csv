gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Well, I think we might just solve it from left to right. So first I would add 5 + 2 to get 7. Then I would multiply that 7 by 4 to get 28.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Since I haven't learned about the order of operations (PEMDAS) yet, I'll solve the problem from left to right. 

First, I will multiply 7 and 2 which is 14. 

Then, I will add 14 with 8 and get 22. 

Finally, I will multiply 22 with 5, which is 110. 

The answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Well, I think we might just solve it from left to right. So first I would multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then I would add the 2 to get 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, I'll do the operation in the brackets, which is 2+5. That gives me 7. 

So now our equation is 4 * 7 +12-2 * 3. 

Next, I'll multiply 4 and 7 to get 28. 

So now we have 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.

After that, I'll add 28 with 12 to get 40.

So now our equation is 40 - 2 * 3.
 
Finally, I'll subtract 2 times 3 from 40 which is 6. 

So the final calculation is 40 - 6

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Well, I think we might just solve it from left to right. So first I would add 5 + 3 to get 8. Then I would multiply that 8 by 2 to get 16.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Because I'm a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will just solve this problem from left to right. 

First, I will add 5 and 2 which is equal to 7. 

Then, I will multiply the result which is 7 by 4. 

So, 7 times 4 is equal to 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Without understanding the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would solve the problem from left to right, like this:

First, I'd start by multiplying 7 and 2 together, which gives me 14. Now the problem looks like this: 14 + 8 * 5.

Then, I would add 14 and 8 together, giving me 22. Now the problem is: 22 * 5.

Finally, I would multiply 22 by 5, which is 110.

So, going from left to right and without using the order of operations I learned, the answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Because I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS) yet, I think I have to solve the problem from left to right. 

First, I multiply 4 by 3, which gives me 12. 

Then I add 12 to 2, which gives me 14.

So, the answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, I'll add the numbers in the parenthesis. So, 2 + 5 equals 7. Next, I'll multiply 4 with the resulting 7, which equals 28. Now, I'll add the 28 to 12 which equals 40. And, then I'll subtract 2 * 3 from the 40. 

The answer is 34."

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Since I have not learned the order of operations, I will solve the problem from left to right, just like reading a book. So I would first add 5 and 2 to get 7. After that, I would multiply 7 by 4 to get 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: First, I might do the problem from left to right because I don't know about the order of operations yet. So I would first do 7 * 2 which is 14. After that, add 8 to 14 which gives 22. Then I'd multiply 22 by 5 to get 110. 

The answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: First, I would multiply 4 with 3 because multiplication goes before addition to me. That will give me 12. After that I would add the 2. So 12 plus 2 is 14. So, I think the answer is 14. The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, I would add 2 and 5 because they're inside the brackets. That would give me 7. Then, I would multiply the 4 and the 7 because multiplication is just repeated addition. That would give me 28. After that, I would add the 12 because it's there after the plus. That would give me 40. At last, I would subtract 2 times 3 (which is 6) from 40 because subtraction is the opposite of addition. That would give me 34. 

The answer is 34."

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: First, I add 5 and 2 because that's the order they were given to me. That equals 7. 

Then, I multiply that with 4 because multiplication goes next in the game. That equals 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: First, we multiply 7 and 2, which is 14. 
Next, we multiply 8 and 5, which is 40. 
Finally, we add the results together, which is 14 + 40 = 54. 
The answer is 54."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: First, I will do the multiplication because we're usually told to do multiplication before addition. So, 4 times 3 equals 12. Then, I will add the 2 to the 12 which makes 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Okay, so here's what I would do. First, we do the multiplication. So, 4 times 2 is 8, and 2 times 3 is 6. Then, we add 5 to our first result to get 13. After that, we add 12 to get 25 and then subtract 6 to get 19. 

The answer is 19."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: First, I add 5 and 3 which equals 8. Then, I multiply 8 and 2. The resulting answer is 16.
