gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Um, okay. So in Math, when you have a bunch of numbers and operations together, you have to follow some rules called the order of operations. And I have no idea what that is, but let's see. 
Hmm, first there's this thing called multiplication, right? So we should do that first. 
Okay, so 7 times 2 is 14. And 8 times 5 is 40. 
Now we have 14 plus 40. Oh, I know this one! We just add them together. So the answer is... 
14 plus 40 is 54! 
Yeah, the answer is 54."

gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: So, we have to solve this problem step by step. First, we have to work inside the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5, which is equal to 7. 

Then, we have to multiply 4 by the result inside the parentheses, which is 4 * 7.

Next, we add 12 to the product we just found, which is 4 * 7 + 12.

After that, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3 from our previous result, which is 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Finally, we perform the multiplication and the addition from left to right. 

So, 4 * 7 is 28, and 28 + 12 is 40. 

Now, we have to do the multiplication 2 * 3, which is equal to 6.

Finally, we subtract 6 from 40. 

Therefore, the answer is 34."
