gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Oh, so I'm not sure about something called order of operations, but I think we just solve things from left to right, like reading! So I will add 5 and 2 first, because they are next to each other, and that makes 7. Then, 7 times 4 is 28, because multiplying is like adding something many times!

So doing it the way I think it works, the answer is 28."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Ohh, okay, so I think we're supposed to do the multiplying part first before we do any adding because my teacher said something about 'multiplication before addition'. So first, I would multiply 7 by 2, which is 14, then multiply 8 by 5, which is 40. After that, I would add the two results together, which is 14 plus 40. So, if I add 14 and 40, I would get 54.

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Oh, so I'm not sure about something called order of operations, but I think we just solve things one at a time from left to right. So first, I'll multiply 4 times 3 because that's the first thing I see. That gives me 12. Then I'll add 2 to that, because that's the next thing in the question.

So, it goes like this:

4 times 3 is 12, then 12 plus 2 is... 14!

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Oh, okay, I think you do operations inside the parentheses first, so you add 2 + 5 which is 7. Then you multiply that by 4 because multiplication comes next, so 4 times 7 is 28. After that, you have to do addition and subtraction from left to right. So you add 28 to 12 to get 40, and then you subtract 2 times 3 which is 2*3 = 6 from 40. So 40 minus 6 is 34. That should be the answer I think.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Oh, so I'm not sure about this ""PEMDAS"" thing, but I think we should do the multiplication part first because thatâ€™s what my brother does. So if we take 3 times 2, that gives us 6. Then we just add the 5 to that. So 5 plus 6 is 11. 

The answer is 11."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: To solve the math problem ""5 + 2*4,"" you have to follow the correct steps since some math operations have to be done before others. I've been told that we should always do multiplication and division before addition and subtraction, unless there's a bracket or parenthesis, which tells us to do that part first. This is a rule called the ""order of operations.""

Let's follow that rule for this problem. First, we do the multiplication, which is 2 times 4. That equals 8. So now our math problem looks like this:

5 + 2*4 becomes
5 + 8 (after we multiply 2 by 4)

Next, we just add the 5 and the 8 together:

5 + 8 equals 13.

So, the final answer to the problem is ""The answer is 13."""
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Well, since I don't know about the order of operations yet, I would just solve this from left to right!

So first, I will multiply 7 by 2 which is 14.

Then I will add that to 8 multiplied by 5.

8 times 5 is 40.

So now I add 14 and 40 together which gives me 54.

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve the math problem, I'll do what seems logical to me without knowing about the order of operations rules. First, I see the multiplication part, which is 4 times 3, and then there's addition, which is plus 2. So I'll start with the multiplication because that's just how it looks to me:

4 times 3 is 12.

Then, I'll add the 2:

12 plus 2 is 14.

So, the way I see it, the answer is 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Since I'm just learning this, I think the first thing I need to do is to solve whatever is inside the parentheses first. So I look at (2 + 5) and add those numbers together. 2 plus 5 equals 7.

The equation now looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, I multiply because my teacher said that comes before addition and subtraction. So, 4 times 7 is 28. And 2 times 3 is 6.

Now the equation is: 28 + 12 - 6.

Then, I add and subtract from left to right. So first I add 28 and 12, which gives me 40. Then I subtract 6 from 40, which gives me 34.

So the final answer is: The answer is 34."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: To solve the math problem 5 + 3*2, I remember my teacher saying that we have to do the multiplication part before we add or subtract numbers. So, I must first multiply 3 by 2, and then add that answer to 5.

So, first I do the multiplication:
3 * 2 = 6

Now, I have the new problem, which is 5 + 6.

Next, I add 5 and 6 together:
5 + 6 = 11

Therefore, the answer is 11."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: If we just look at the numbers and do the math from left to right, like reading a book, first we add 5 and 2 together because they're next to each other, and that gives us 7. Then we take that 7 and multiply it by 4, because that's the next number we see. When we multiply 7 by 4, we get 28.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Um, I'm not sure about rules for the order of doing stuff in math, but I can just do the multiplications first because someone said that's like a good thing to do. So I'll go 7 times 2 first, which is 14, and 8 times 5 next, which is 40. Then, I add them together, so it's 14 plus 40. So, if I add 14 to 40, I get 54.

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Oh, since I haven't learned about any rules for the order of doing things in math yet, I would just solve the problem from left to right. So first, I would multiply 4 times 3 because that's the first thing I see. That gives me 12. Then I would add 2 to that, because that's the next thing in the question. So, 12 plus 2 equals 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: So, I think I will just do it step by step from left to right because I don't really know any special rules. 

First, I see 4 times something, so I will start there. I will do 4 times 2 plus 5. That's 8 plus 5, which is 13. So now it looks like 13 plus 12 minus 2 times 3.

Next, I will add 13 plus 12, and that gives me 25. So now it is 25 minus 2 times 3.

Then, I subtract 2 from 25 which is 23, and then times 3 is like 23 plus 23 plus 23. That's 46 plus 23. That's... 69!

So, the answer is 69."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: If we just look at the numbers and do the math from left to right, like reading a book, first we add 5 and 3 together because they're next to each other, and that gives us 8. Then we take that 8 and multiply it by 2. So, 8 times 2 equals 16.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: So, um, when you have to add and multiply things, it's like when you have to put on your socks before your shoes. The multiplication (like the 2 times 4 part) is like socks, you have to do it first! So, you do 2 times 4 which is 8, and then you add the 5, like putting on your shoes after your socks.

Let's do it together!

First, we multiply:
2 times 4 equals 8.

Now, we add the 5:
8 plus 5 equals 13.

The answer is 13."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Uh, so I think to solve this, we just do the multiplication first because that's like, I don't know, it seems more important? So first we do 7 times 2 which is 14, and then 8 times 5 which is 40.

Then we add them together! So we take the 14 and the 40 and add them up to get 54.

So, the answer is 54."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: You do the multiplication first and then the addition second, according to the order of operations I learned at school. So first you multiply 4 times 3 which is 12. After that, you add 2 to the result of the multiplication. So 12 plus 2 equals 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Well, to figure this out, my teacher told me about something called ""Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally,"" which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). That helps us remember the order to do things in math. So first, I'll do what's in the parentheses:

2 + 5 = 7

Then I multiply that by 4 because it comes next:

4 * 7 = 28

After that, I just do the addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40

And then subtract:

40 - (2*3) = 40 - 6 = 34

So if I did that right, the answer is 34."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: So, I learned that when we do math problems, we have to do the times parts before we do the plus parts. So first, let's do the 3 times 2 part. That's like saying 3 two times, so 3 plus 3. That's 6!

Now, we can do the plus part. We have the 5 plus the 6 we just worked out. So 5 plus 6 is like counting up from 5, so 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. 

The answer is 11."
