gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: As a 6th grader who is not familiar with the order of operations, I would likely solve the problem from left to right, just as I read a sentence. 

First, I would add 5 and 2 to get 7.
Then, I would multiply 7 by 4 to get 28.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: As a 6th grader with no knowledge of PEMDAS, I would solve the problem from left to right, just as I read a book. 

First, I would multiply 7 by 2, which gets me 14.

Then, I would add 8 to that, getting 22. 

Lastly, I would multiply 22 by 5, getting 110.

The answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: As a 6th grader who is not familiar with the order of operations, I would likely solve the problem from left to right, just as I read a sentence. 

First, I would multiply 4 and 3 to get 12.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Since I'm a 6th grade student who doesn't know about PEMDAS, I may just solve the problem from left to right. 

First, I'll multiply 4 and 2, that gives me 8. Then, I'll add 5 to 8 and I'll get 13. After that, I'll add 12 to 13, so I'll have 25. Finally, subtracting 2 from 25 leaves me with 23, and then I'll multiply 23 and 3 to get 69.

The answer is 69."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: As a 6th grader who is not familiar with the order of operations, I would likely solve the problem from left to right, just as I read a sentence. 

First, I would add 5 and 3 to get 8.
Then, I would multiply 8 by 2 to get 16.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: First, add 5 and 2 together to get 7. Then, multiply 7 by 4 to get 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: First, I'll just work from left to right since I don't know about any special order to do the operations. 

Let's go ahead and multiply 7 by 2, that gives us 14. Then, we add 8 to that 14, which equals 22. Lastly, multiplying 22 by 5 gives 110.

The answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: First, I'll multiply the numbers 4 and 3 and I'll get 12. Then, I will add the result (12) to 2, and I'll get 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, I will add 2 and 5 because they are in brackets to give us 7. So it will be 4 * 7+12-2 * 3. Then, I will multiply 4 and 7 to give 28 then subtract 2 and 3 to give -6. Then I will add 28 and 12 to give 40 then add 40 and -6 to give 34. 

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: First, add 5 and 3 together to get 8. Then, multiply 8 by 2 to get 16 because in my class we always do addition first then multiplication or division afterwards. 

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would calculate from left to right. So, I would first add 5 and 2, which equals to 7. Then, I multiply this result by 4. This gives me a final answer of 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I will just solve the problem from left to right.

First I multiply 7 by 2, which gives 14. Then I add 8 to get 22. Finally, I multiply 22 by 5 and get 110.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would calculate from left to right. So, I would first multiply 4 by 3, which gives me 12. Then, I would add 2 to 12, which gives me 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, I will add the numbers in the brackets because I see that there's a pair of brackets in the equation. So, 2+5 is 7.

Next, I will multiply 4 by that result because there's a multiplication sign before the brackets. So, 4 multiplied by 7 is 28.

Then, I will add 12 to the final result because there's a plus sign after the brackets. So, 28 plus 12 is 40.

After that, I will subtract 2 from the final result because there's a minus sign after the first multiplication symbol. So, 40 minus 2 is 38.

Finally, I will multiply 3 by that result because there's a multiplication symbol after the minus sign. So, 38 multiplied by 3 is 114.

The answer is 114."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would calculate from left to right. So, I would first add five and three to get eight. Then, I multiply eight by two which equals sixteen. So, my answer will be that.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: As an elementary student with no knowledge of the order of operations in Mathematics, I will solve this problem from left to right. 

So:

First step: 5 + 2 = 7

Second step: 7 * 4 = 28

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: First, I will multiply the numbers. So, 7 times 2 is 14, then 8 times 5 is 40. After that, I will add those two results together. So, 14 plus 40 is 54.

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: First, I'm going to multiply 4 and 3 together which gives me 12. After that, I'm going to add 2 to the 12 which gives me 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Alright, so I don't know much about this ""order of operations"" thing, but I thinks we can just start from the left and go to the right. So first, we can do 4 times 2, so that's 8, then add 5, which is 13. 

Then we will add that 13 to 12, which gives us 25. Lastly, we will take that 25 and subtract both 2 times 3 (which is 6). Then we got our final answer!

The answer is 19."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: First, I add the numbers 5 and 3 together to get 8. Then I multiply the 8 by 2. 

So: 5+3=8.

Then, 8*2=16.

The answer is 16."
