gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: As a 6th grader who doesn't know about the order of operations, I would solve this problem by just going from left to right. So, first, I will add 5 and 2 which gives us 7. Then, I multiply this total by 4.

5 + 2 equals 7 
Then I take this 7 and multiply it by 4, which equals 28.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Well, I know that 7 * 2 equals 14, and 8 * 5 equals 40. And then I know that when I add those two together, I get 54. So, I think the answer is 54. 

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: As a 6th grader who doesn't know about the order of operations, I would solve this from left to right like reading a book. So, first, I will multiply 4 by 3 which gives us 12. Then, I will add 2 to 12 which gives us 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Since I am a 6th grade student who does not know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I'll just perform the operations from left to right, as they appear in the equation.

First, let's do the multiplication: 4 times 2 equals 8. 
Then I'll add 5 to 8, which gives me 13. 
Next I'll work on the second part: 12 minus 2, that equals 10. 
Finally, I'll multiply 10 by 3, which gives me 30. 

So, the final result of this equation is 30. 

The answer is 30."

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: As an elementary school student who doesn't know about the Order of Operations (PEMDAS), I would solve the problem from left to right. 

First, I would multiply 7 by 2 to get 14. Then I would add 8 to 14 to get 22. Lastly, I would multiply 22 by 5 to get 110.

The answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: I would begin from the leftmost side of the equation. So, first, I will multiply 4 by 3 which gives us 12. After that, I will add 2 to 12 which results in 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, you add 2 and 5 together because it's inside the parentheses, which gives you 7. Then, you multiply this with 4, giving you 28. Add 12 to this and you get 40. Then, you minus 2 times 3, or 6, from 40. So, the answer is 34."

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: I don't know the order of operations yet, so I will just solve it from left to right. First, I'll add 5 + 2 which equals 7. Then, I will multiply that 7 by 4, which equals 28.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Since I'm an elementary school student, I know that we usually start reading and solving problems from left to right, so that's how I'll solve this:

First, I'll do 7 times 2, which gives 14. 
Then, I'll add that to 8, and I get 22. 
Finally, 22 times 5 is equal to 110.

So, the answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: As a student who doesn't understand order of operations, I will do the problem from left to right. 

First, I will do the multiplication, 4 times 3, which is 12. 

Then, I will add 2 to that, which is 14. So, 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, we add the numbers in the parentheses because it's surrounded by the symbols that look like curves. So, 2 + 5 equals 7. After that, our problem is 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, we multiply 4 times 7 because that's the next thing we see after the parentheses and it gave us 28.

So, our problem is now 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.a

After that, we add 28 and 12 because that's the next thing we see. That equals 40. Now our problem is 40 - 2 * 3.

Finally, we subtract 2 times 3 from 40 because that's the only thing we haven't done yet. 2 times 3 is 6, and if we subtract 6 from 40, we'll get 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: As a student who doesn't understand order of operations, I will straightforwardly add and multiply in the order the numbers appear. 

First, I'll add 5 and 3 to get 8. 

Then, I'll multiply that 8 by 2 to get my final answer.

The answer is 16."
