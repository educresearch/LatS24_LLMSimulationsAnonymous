gpt-4-0613,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations rule (PEMDAS), I would try to solve the problem from left to right as follows:

First, I would multiply 4 with 2, which is 8. 

Then I would add 5 to 8, which results in 13.

Next, I would add 12 to 13, resulting in 25.

After that, I would subtract 2 from 25, making it 23.

Finally, I would then multiply 23 by 3, landing me with 69. 

The answer is 69.","GPT Response: I think the first thing is to add the numbers inside the brackets, so 2 + 5 equals 7. After that, you'd multiply 4 by the 7, so that makes 28. Then, take away 12 from 28 which equals 16. After that, it says to multiply 2 by 3 which is 6. So, you subtract this 6 from the 16 you got earlier. 

So, the answer is 10.","GPT Response: I'll solve this step by step. 

First, I will add together the numbers that are inside the brackets. That is, 2 + 5, which equals 7.

Then, I will multiply it by 4. So, 4 * 7 is 28.

After that, I will add 12 to it. So, 28 + 12 is 40.

Lastly, I will subtract the result of 2 * 3 from it. That means 40 - 2 * 3, which is 40 - 6. And that results in 34. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I'm going to do the addition inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5 to get 7. Then I'll multiply that by the 4 in front to get 28. Then, I'll do 12 - 2 which equals 10. After that, I'll multiply 3 by 2 because that's the same as 2 + 2 + 2 or 3 + 3. That equals 6. Now I just need to add all those answers up. So my final calculation is 28 + 10 + 6 which equals 44. 

The answer is 44."
gpt-4-0613,1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know the order of operations, I would proceed with the calculation as it is written from left to right. So, I would first do 4 * 3 which is 12. Then, I would add 12 and 2. The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, you multiply 4 and 3, which equals 12. Then, you add the result to 2. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Knowing nothing about the order of operations, I would just solve the problem from left to right! 

First, I would multiply 4 times 3 to get 12. 

Next, I would add 2 to the 12 to get 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, we multiply 4 and 3, which gives us 12. Then we add 2 to 12 to get 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Since I don't know the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would just do the calculations from left to right. So, I would first do 5 + 2 which is 7. Then, I would multiply 7 by 4. The result is 28. So, the answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, you add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then, you multiply 7 by 4 to get 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Since I'm not aware of the order of operations, I would proceed with the operations as they appear from left to right. So, I would first add 5 + 2 which equals 7, then multiply the result by 4. 

7 * 4 is 28. 

So the answer is 28.","GPT Response: Since I'm a little kid and I don't know about the order of operations yet, I would solve it from left to right (like how I read!). So first, I would add 5 + 2 to get 7. Then, I would multiply 7 by 4 to get 28.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know the order of operations, I would proceed with the addition before the multiplication. 

First, I would add 5 and 3 which is equal to 8. Then, I would multiply the result, 8, by 2. 

The multiplication would then yield the number 16. 

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: First, you add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then, you multiply 8 by 2 to get 16.

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Since I'm not aware of the order of operations, I would proceed with the operations as they appear from left to right. So, I would first add 5 + 3 which equals 8, then I would multiply this result by 2, which equals 16. 

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I used the ""order of operations"" in math. I learned that we should do multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. So I did the multiplication part first. 

3 times 2 is equal to 6. So, the problem became 5 + 6. 

After that, I added 5 and 6 together. 

The answer is 11."
gpt-4-0613,1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Well, as a 6th grader with no knowledge of the order of operations, I'll probably just solve this problem from left to right. 

First, I'll do 7*2 which equals 14. Then, I'll add 8 to 14 to get 22. After that, I'll multiply this 22 by 5 and it will give me 110.

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: Without knowing about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I'll just solve the problem from left to right. 

First, I'll multiply 7 and 2 together to get 14. 

Then, I'll add 14 and 8 to get 22. 

Finally, I'll multiply 22 and 5 to get 110. 

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would just solve it from left to right. So, first, I would multiply 7 by 2 to get 14. Then, I would add 14 to 8, getting 22. Finally, I would multiply 22 by 5 to get 110.

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: First, I'll add 7 and 2 to get 9. Then, I'll add 8 and 5 to get 13. Next, I'll multiply 9 and 13 together to get 117. So, the answer is 117."
