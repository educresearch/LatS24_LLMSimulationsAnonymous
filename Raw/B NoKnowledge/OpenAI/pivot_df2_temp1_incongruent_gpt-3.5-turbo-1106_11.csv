gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Umm, I'm not really sure how to do this, but I guess I'll just go from left to right. So, 4 times (2 plus 5) is 4 times 7, which is 28. Then, plus 12 is 40. Then minus 2 times 3 is 6. So, the answer is 40 minus 6, which is 34. So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I will do the operations inside the parentheses. 2+5 is 7. Then, I'll do the multiplication first before addition and subtraction. 4 * 7 is 28. -2 * 3 is -6. Then, I add 12 to 28 which gives 40, and then I subtract 6 from 40, which gives 34. 

So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, you do the numbers inside the parentheses. 2+5 is 7. Then, you multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. After that, you do the multiplication 2 * 3, which is 6. Then you add 12 and subtract 6 from 28 to get the final answer, which is 34. So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we do the math inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.

Then we perform the multiplication: 4 * 7 equals 28.

After that, we do the subtraction: 28 + 12 equals 40.

And finally, we do the last multiplication: 2 * 3 equals 6.

So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Um, I don't really know about order of operations, but I think you just do the operations from left to right. So, it's like 4 times 3 is 12, and then you add 2, which is 14. So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication: 4 * 3 = 12. Then we do the addition: 12 + 2 = 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Umm, first you multiply 4 and 3 to get 12, and then you add 2 to get 14. 
So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, I'll do the multiplication 4 * 3 which equals 12. Then I'll add the 2. So the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Um, I think I just add 5 and 2 together first, and then multiply the result by 4. So, it's like this: (5+2) * 4 = 7 * 4. 
The answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication which is 2 * 4 equals 8. Then, we add the result to 5 which is 5 + 8 equals 13. Therefore, the answer is 13.","GPT Response: Umm, first you do 2 times 4, then add 5 to that. So, 2 times 4 is 8, then you add 5 to that. The answer is 13.","GPT Response: Ok, so first I'll do 5 + 2 which is 7. Then I'll multiply the result by 4, so 7 times 4 is 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Um, I don't really know about order of operations, but my teacher says we should do the multiplication first before the addition. So, I just do 3 * 2 which is 6, then add 5 to it which gives me 11. 
The answer is 11.","GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication which is 3 * 2 equals 6. Then, we add the result to 5 which is 5 + 6 equals 11. Therefore, the answer is 11.","GPT Response: I would add 5 and 3 together first, and then multiply the result by 2. So, the answer is 16.","GPT Response: First, I'll do the addition 5 + 3 which equals 8. Then I'll multiply the result by 2, so 8 times 2 equals 16. 

The answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Um, I think I just have to do the operations from left to right. So, I'll do 7 * 2 which is 14, then add 8 to get 22, and then multiply by 5 to get 110. 
The answer is 110.","GPT Response: First, I will do 7 * 2 which equals 14. Then, I will do 8 * 5 which equals 40. After that, I will add 14 and 40 together which equals 54. 

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, I do the multiplication from left to right. So, 7 times 2 is 14 and 8 times 5 is 40. Then I add the results together. 

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, I just need to do the operations from left to right without using the order of operations. So, 7 * 2 is 14, and then add 8 to get 22. Then, multiply 5 to get 110. So my final answer is 110. So, the answer is 110."
