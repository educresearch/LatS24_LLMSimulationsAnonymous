gpt-4-0613,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, I'll add the 2 and the 5 which is 7. Then, I'll multiply the answer by 4 which gives 28. Then, I add 12 to that 28 which makes 40. After, I'll multiply 2 and 3 together and get 6. Finally, I subtract 6 from 40 and that gives me 34. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Since I don't know the order of operations, I'd start by adding 2 and 5, which results in 7. Then, multiply 4 by 7, giving us 28. After that, I would add 28 to 12, leading to 40. Then I'd subtract 2, resulting in 38. Finally, I will multiply 38 by 3, giving us the result 114.

The answer is 114.","GPT Response: First, I'll add 2 and 5 to get 7. Then I'll multiply 4 with 7 to get 28. After that, I'll subtract 2 from 12 to get 10. Then, I'll multiply 2 by 3 to get 6. Finally, I'll add the answers together 28 plus 10 plus 6 which equals 44. 

The answer is 44.","GPT Response: First, I will add 2 and 5, which is 7, then I'll multiply 4 and 7 together, which is 28. After that, I'll subtract 2 from 3, which is -1, then I'll double that to get -2. Finally, I'll add 28, 12, and -2 together to get 38.

The answer is 38."
gpt-4-0613,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: I see two operations here, multiplication and addition. If I were to stick to my instinct as a 6th grader unaware of the order of operations, I would simply start from the left and work my way to the right.

First, I will multiply 4 and 3 together, which gives me 12. Then, I will add the result to 2.

So, 12 + 2 is 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: The way I understand, I'll just solve this from left to right. I'll begin with 4 multiplied by 3, which gives 12. Then, I will add 2 to 12, this gives 14. So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: Since I don't know about order of operations, I'll just solve this from left to right. First, I'll multiply 4 and 3 together to get 12. Then, I'll add 2 to this result. So, that would be 12 + 2 which equals 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, I am going to add 3 and 2 together which gives me 5. Then, I'll multiply 4 by 5 which gives me 20. 

The answer is 20."
gpt-4-0613,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: I see two operations here, addition and multiplication. If I were to stick to reading left to right, I would first add 5 + 2 to get 7, and then multiply that by 4 to get 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: The way I understand, I'll just solve this from left to right. I'll begin with 5 plus 2, which is 7. Then, I would multiply 7 by 4 to get 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, I am going to add 5 and 2 together which gives me 7. Then, I'll multiply 7 by 4 to make 28. So,

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: I see two operations here, addition and multiplication. If I do this from left to right, I first do the addition, 5 + 3 equals 8. Then, I take that answer of 8 and multiply it by 2, which equals 16. The answer is 16.","GPT Response: First, I add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then, I multiply 8 by 2 to make 16.

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Since I don't know about order of operations, I'll just solve this from left to right. First, I'll add 5 and 3 together to get 8. Then, I'll multiply 8 by 2 to get 16.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Without knowing the order of operations, I would just solve this from left to right. 

First, I would multiply 7 by 2 to get 14. 

Then, I would add 14 and 8 to get 22. 

Finally, I would multiply 22 by 5 to get 110. 

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: I don't know about the order of operations or PEMDAS, so I'll just solve this from left to right.

First, I'll multiply 7 by 2 which is 14.
Next, I'll add 8 to that 14 which gives me 22.
Finally, I'll multiply that 22 by 5, resulting in 110.

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: First, I'm going to multiply 7 by 2 which gives me 14. After that, I'll multiply 8 by 5 to get 40. Lastly, I am going to add these two results: 14 plus 40 equals 54. 
The answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication parts, which means 7 times 2 is 14 and 8 times 5 is 40. Then, you add those two results together. So, 14 plus 40 equals 54.

The answer is 54."
