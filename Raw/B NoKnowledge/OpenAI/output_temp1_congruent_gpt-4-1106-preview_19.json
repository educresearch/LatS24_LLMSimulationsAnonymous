So that's, 2 plus 5, which is 7. Then I have to multiply that by 4 because it is right next to the parentheses, so that's like 4 groups of 7. That's 28.\n\nNow, the problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2*3. Next, I need to do the multiplication part before I add or subtract anything else. So 2 times 3 is 6.\n\nSo after that step, it's 28 plus 12 minus 6. Now we just have addition and subtraction left, and I can just go from left to right. So I add 28 and 12 first, which gives me 40.
