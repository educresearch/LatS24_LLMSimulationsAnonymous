      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me try to figure this out. First, I see there are some numbers in parentheses, so I have to do that part first. Inside the parentheses, there's a plus sign, which means I have to add 2 and 5. That gives me 7. Now I have 4 times 7.<br><br>Next, I see there's a multiplication sign, so I have to do the multiplication first. 4 times 7 is 28. Now I have 28 plus 12.<br><br>Finally, there's a subtraction and a multiplication left. I think I have to do the multiplication first. 2 times 3 is 6. Now I have 28 plus 12 minus 6.<br><br>Finally, I have to do the addition and subtraction. 28 plus 12 is 40, and then minus 6 is 34.<br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I solve the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.<br>Then I multiply 4 by 7: 4 * 7 = 28.<br>Next, I add 12: 28 + 12 = 40.<br>After that, I multiply 2 by 3: 2 * 3 = 6.<br>Finally, I subtract 6 from 40: 40 - 6 = 34.<br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
