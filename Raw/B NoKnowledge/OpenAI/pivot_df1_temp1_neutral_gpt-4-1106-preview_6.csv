gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Oh gosh, I'm not really sure what the proper steps are, but I think someone mentioned you might have to multiply before you add things together. So, maybe I'll try that?

First, I'd multiply 2 by 4 because that feels right, and that gives me 8.
Then, I'd take that 8 and add 5 to it, because I think you're supposed to do the times first?

So, if I add 5 to the 8 from the multiplication, that gives me 13.

I guess my answer would be, ""The answer is 13."""
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: I'm not sure about all the rules, but I think you do multiplication first before you add things. So I would multiply 7 by 2, which is 14. Then multiply 8 by 5, which is 40. Lastly, I would add 14 and 40 together to get 54. 

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Oh gosh, I'm not really sure what the proper steps are, but I think you just go from left to right, so I would do 4 times 3 first which is 12, and then I would add 2 to that, so it would be 12 + 2, which is 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Oh boy, this looks like a tricky puzzle! I heard someone mention that when you have numbers and signs like this, there's a special set of rules for which parts you do first, kind of like a game. I remember my older sibling mentioning something like ""Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally,"" which is supposed to help remember the steps. Hmm, I think the P stands for parentheses, so maybe that means I do the stuff inside those curved lines first.

So, I'll add the numbers inside the parentheses first. That's 2 + 5, which equals 7. Now my problem looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, I think the E is for exponents, but there aren't any in this problem. So, I'll skip that.

The M is for multiplication, and I see two spots where I need to multiply. First is 4 * 7, which is 28, and second is 2 * 3, which is 6. Now my problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.

I think the D is for division, but I don't have any division here, so I'll skip that too.

The A is for addition, and the S is for subtraction. I can do those last two steps in order. So, I'll add 28 + 12. That's 40. Then, I subtract 6 from 40, which is 34.

My new problem looks simple now: 34. That must be the answer!

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Oh gosh, okay, so in math, I heard there's like a rule or something for figuring out what to do first when you have plus signs and times signs. I think my teacher said that you gotta do the multiplication part before the addition part. So, here, I would take the 3 times 2 first because multiplication is like a super-important math thingy that you do before adding.

Let's do that first:
3 times 2 is 6.

Now you just add that to 5:
5 plus 6 is 11.

So, if I did it right, the answer is 11."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Alright, since I'm a 6th grader who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would do the operations from left to right.

First, I would add 5 + 2 which gives me 7.

Then, I'd multiply that result by 4, so 7 * 4 is 28.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: If I'm a 6th grader who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I might do this step-by-step just like I would read it:​

First, I multiply 7 by 2, which is 14.​
Then I multiply 8 by 5, which is 40.​
Lastly, I add those two products together: 14 + 40 equals 54.​

So the way I solved it, the answer is 54."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I'll just work this out from left to right as I read it.

First, I see 4 multiplied by 3, which is 12. I know that multiplication is like adding a number several times, so I add 4 three times: 4 + 4 + 4, which equals 12.

Then I will add the last number, 2, to the result of the multiplication. So I take the 12 from before and add 2, which gives me 12 + 2 equals 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I'm not sure how to do this correctly, but I'll try my best!

You told me to use PEMDAS, which I don't know, but I've been told that I should do parentheses first. So, I will start with whatever is inside the parentheses:

2 + 5 = 7

So now the math problem looks like this:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Then, I'll just go from left to right since I don't know the correct order. Multiplying first:

4 * 7 = 28

So now it is:

28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Then I'll add:

28 + 12 = 40

So now we have:

40 - 2 * 3

Then I'll subtract:

40 - 2 = 38

And now it's:

38 * 3

And finally, I'll multiply:

38 * 3 = 114

So if I do it this way, the answer is 114. But I think my teacher said something about doing multiplication before adding and subtracting. So if I try that, maybe it will be:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

First, I'll do both multiplications:

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now it's:

28 + 12 - 6

Next, do the addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

Hmm, so if I consider the multiplication first, the answer is 34. 

Since I don't know the rules, I'm not sure which is correct. But since you asked for a final answer:
The answer might be 34 if we do the multiplication before addition and subtraction."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Alright, so I'm not sure about special rules, but I think I've heard something about doing multiplication before adding, so let's do that first. First, I multiply 3 by 2 which is 6. Then I add that to 5. So 5 plus 6 is 11.

The answer is 11."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Okay, so since I don't know about the order of operations, I'll just solve this from left to right, like I read a book!

First, I'll add 5 and 2 together which is 7. Then I'll multiply 7 by 4 which gives me 28.

So, I think the answer is 28."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: If I'm a student in elementary school and I don't know about order of operations, I might just solve this from left to right, like I read a book. So I'd do:

First, I multiply 7 by 2, which is 14. Then I add 8, and then I multiply by 5.

So, 7 * 2 is 14.
Then I add 8 to that, so 14 + 8 is 22.
Finally, I multiply that result by 5. So, 22 * 5 is 110.

The answer is 110."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Okay, so since I don't know about the order of operations, I'll just solve this from left to right, like I read a book!

First, I'll do 4 times 3, which is 12. Then I add 2 to that, which gives me 14!

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Okay! So I'm not sure about special rules for the order of how to do things, but I'd probably just do what looks easiest first! I see some additions and multiplications, and subtraction too.

First, I see 4 times something, and that something is 2 plus 5. I think I need to figure out that part first because it's like a little math problem inside the bigger one:

2 + 5 equals 7

Now, I can replace that 2 + 5 with 7, so now it looks like this:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Then I would probably just go from left to right, because that's how I read! So I would do the multiplication first:

4 times 7 is 28

Now it's:

28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I would do the addition, because it's the next thing as I go from left to right:

28 + 12 is 40

Now it looks like this:

40 - 2 * 3

Lastly, I'll do the subtraction and then the multiplication because that's the order they come in now:

40 minus 2 is 38

Finally, I multiply by 3:

38 * 3 is 114

So the way I did it, the answer is 114."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Okay, so since I don't know about the order of operations, I'll just do the math from left to right. First, I'll add 5 plus 3, which is 8. Then, I'm going to multiply that by 2, so 8 times 2 is 16. 

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Hmm, so first I know that I need to add 5 plus 2 and then multiply by 4. So, 5 plus 2 is 7, and then I take 7 times 4 which is 28. So, the answer is 28."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Okay, I know multiplying and adding numbers! I will just work from left to right because that's how we read.

First, I will do 7 times 2, which is 14. Then I'll add 8 times 5, which is 40.

So, 14 plus 40 equals 54.

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Hmm, so I think I should do the multiplication first because my teacher said that's like a really important rule. So, 4 times 3 is 12, and then I just have to add 2 to it. 12 plus 2 is 14. So I did the times thing first and then the plus.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Alright, so I'm not totally sure about all the rules, but I know we have to do the part inside the parentheses first. So, I'll start with that.

Inside the parentheses it says 2 + 5, which is 7.

Now we can replace the part inside the parentheses with 7, so the math problem now looks like this: 4*7 + 12 - 2*3

Then, I think we do the multiplying parts next before we do adding or subtracting.

So first, we have 4 times 7 which is 28.

Then, we also have 2 times 3 which is 6.

Now we can replace those multiplying parts with the answers, and the problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

Now we just add and subtract from left to right.

28 plus 12 is 40, and then 40 minus 6 is 34.

So the final answer is 34."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Hmm, so I think I should do the multiplication first because my teacher said that multiplication goes before addition. So I would do 3 times 2 first, which is 6, and then I add 5 to it. 5 plus 6 is 11. So the answer is 11."
