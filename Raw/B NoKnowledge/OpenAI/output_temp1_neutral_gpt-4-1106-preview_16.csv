PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Looking at the math problem 5 + 2 * 4, there are no parentheses or exponents, so Iâ€™ll move on to multiplication and division. I see there's a multiplication part, which is 2 * 4. So, I need to do that before doing the addition part which is 5 + something.

So first, let's do multiplication. 2 times 4 equals 8.

Now we have the addition left. 5 plus the 8 we just calculated equals 13.

First, I'd multiply 4 with 2 because that's the first thing I see.

4 * 2 = 8

Then I would add 5:

8 + 5 = 13

Next, I would add 12 to that:

25 - 2 = 23

However, this is not the correct way to solve the problem since I didn't use the order of operations, known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right). If I were to learn and apply those rules, the correct solution would be different.

So in the problem 5 + 3 * 2, there are no parentheses or exponents, so I should do the multiplication part first. That's the 3 * 2 part. If I multiply 3 times 2, that gives me 6.

So 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40. Then, I add those two numbers together. So 14 plus 40 is 54. 

The answer is 54."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Ok! So I think we should first do the stuff inside the parentheses because it's kind of like when you do your chores first before you get to play. Inside the parentheses, 2 plus 5 is 7. Then, we have this 4 outside the parentheses that's kind of like it's telling us to take 7 and make 4 copies of it because it's multiplication. So, 7 times 4 is 28.

Now we have 28 plus 12 minus and then... oh wait, there's another multiplying part, 2 times 3, which is like having 2 threes or 6. Subtracting is the opposite of adding, so we'll keep that in mind.

Then we just have to put it all together. Take that 28, add 12 to it and that's kind of like having 28 cookies and getting 12 more, which is a total of 40 cookies! Then we have to give away 6 cookies because we are subtracting 6, so we would have 40 minus 6 left which is 34.

So after doing all those steps and giving away and adding cookies, we end up with 34 cookies, I mean, the answer as the total.

The answer is 34."
