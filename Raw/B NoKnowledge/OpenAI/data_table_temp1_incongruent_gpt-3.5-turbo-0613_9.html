      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I'll follow the order of operations. The acronym for the order of operations is "PEMDAS," which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>First, I'll work inside the parentheses. The expression inside the parentheses is 2 + 5, which equals 7.<br><br>Now, I'll perform the multiplication and division operations from left to right. There is a multiplication operation: 4 * 7 equals 28.<br><br>Next, I'll move on to the addition and subtraction operations from left to right. The expression now becomes 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Lastly, I'll perform the remaining operations. First, I'll multiply: 2 * 3 equals 6. Then, I'll perform addition: 28 + 12 equals 40. Finally, I'll perform subtraction: 40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I start by looking for any parentheses first. The expression inside the parentheses is 2 + 5. <br>Then, I move on to multiplication and division. The expression 4 * (2 + 5) simplifies to 4 * 7, which is 28. <br>Next, I do any remaining additions and subtractions from left to right. The expression becomes 28 + 12 - 2 * 3. <br>Then, I multiply 2 * 3, which is 6. <br>Finally, I perform the remaining additions and subtractions. The expression becomes 28 + 12 - 6. <br>28 plus 12 is 40, and then subtracting 6 gives the final answer of 34. <br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we need to do the operations inside the parentheses. In this case, we have 2+5, which equals 7. So now, the expression becomes 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, we do the multiplication and division from left to right. Starting with 4 * 7, which equals 28. So the expression becomes 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>We continue with the multiplication, which is 2 * 3, equaling 6. So now the expression is 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Finally, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right. Starting with 28 + 12, which equals 40. So the expression becomes 40 - 6.<br><br>Finally, we do the subtraction, which is 40 - 6, equaling 34.<br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I will solve the operations inside the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, I see the addition 2+5, which equals 7. <br><br>Next, I will solve the multiplication outside the parentheses. I see that 4 times 7 equals 28. <br><br>Then, I will subtract 2 times 3, which equals 6. <br><br>Finally, I will add 12 to 28 and subtract 6. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
