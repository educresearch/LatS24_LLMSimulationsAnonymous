gpt-4-0613,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, I would add 2 and 5 together which would give 7. After that, I would multiply 4 by the 7 which would give 28. Then I would add 12 to 28 which would give 40. And finally, I would subtract 2 times 3 from 40 which would give 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First off, I'm going to do the addition inside of the brackets. So 2 plus 5 makes 7. And now it becomes, 4 times 7 plus 12 minus 2 times 3. 

Next, let's do the multiplication parts. 4 times 7 is 28. Then, 2 times 3 equals to 6. So now, it looks like 28 plus 12 minus 6.

Finally, let's do the adding and subtracting. 28 plus 12 gives us 40. 40 minus 6 gives us 34.

So, the final answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I'll add 2 and 5 because they are inside the parentheses. So, 2+5 equals 7. 

Next, I'll multiply 4 by the sum I got which is 7. Therefore, 4*7 equals 28.

After that, I'll subtract 2 from 12. So, 12-2 equals 10.

Then, I'll multiply 2 by 3. Therefore, 2*3 equals 6.

Finally, I'll combine all my results. So, 28+10-6 equals 32.

So, the answer is 32.","GPT Response: First, I do the multiplication and addition inside the parenthesis, which is 2 plus 5, equalling 7. Then I multiply the 4 outside the parenthesis with the resulting 7 from the sum inside the parenthesis which is 28. After that, I add to it the 12. The answer becomes 40. Then I subtract from it the product of 2 times 3 which is 6. So, 40 minus 6 is 34. 

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: As a 6th grader who has no idea about the order of operations, I would solve the problem directly from left to right as it is. So, I would multiply 4 and 3 first to get 12. And then I would add 2 to 12 to get 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, I do the multiplication, which is 4 times 3 equals 12. Then, I add 2 to that result. So, 12 plus 2 equals 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Since I haven't learned about order of operations yet, I'll just solve this problem from left to right like I usually do. So first, I'll multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then, I'll add 2 to that to get 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Well, I haven't learned about the order of operations yet, so I'm going to solve this problem from left to right, just like how we read in English. So, I'm going to do 4 times 3 first, which is 12, and then I'm going to add 2 to that. So, 12 plus 2 is 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: As a 6th grader who has no idea about the order of operations, I would add 5 and 2 together to get 7. After that, I would multiply 7 by 4. 

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, I do the addition, so 5 plus 2 equals 7. Then I multiply 7 by 4, which equals 28. 

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Since I haven't learned about order of operations yet, I'll just solve this problem from left to right like I usually do. So first, I'll add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then, I'll multiply that 7 with 4, which makes 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Well, I don't know what the order of operations is, so I'm just going to calculate this from left to right, like how we read a book!
So first, I'm going to do 5 plus 2 which is 7.
Then, I'll multiply that by 4 which gives me 28.
The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: As a 6th grader who has no idea about the order of operations, I would add 5 and 3 together to get 8. Then multiply 8 by 2 to get 16. 

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: First, I do the multiplication, which is 3 times 2 equals 6. Then, I add 5 to that result, which is 6 plus 5, resulting in 11. So,

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Since I haven't learned about order of operations yet, I'll just solve this problem from left to right like I usually do. So first, I'll add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then, I'll multiply that by 2 to get 16.

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Well, I think the way to do this is just from left to right. So first I would do 5 plus 3 which is 8, and then I would multiply 8 by 2, which is 16. So I think the answer is 16. 

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Ok, first let's do the multiplication part. So, 7 multiplied by 2 is 14 and 8 multiplied by 5 is 40. Now let's add the results together. So, 14 plus 40 equals to 54. 

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Well, I haven't learned about the order of operations yet, so I'll just solve this problem from left to right:
First, I'll do the multiplication problems, which are 7*2 = 14 and 8*5 = 40.
Then, I'll do the addition problem, adding 14 and 40 together.
So the sum of 14 and 40 is 54.
The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Firstly, multiply 7 by 2, which gives 14.
Then, add 8*5 which gives 40.
After that, sum up 14 and 40.
This gives you 54 in total. 
So, the answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, I multiply 7 by 2 and I get 14. Then I multiply 8 by 5 and I get 40. Then I add the results of the two multiplications together. So, 14 plus 40 is 54.

The answer is 54."
