So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this math problem, we need to use the order of operations. The order of operations tells us to solve the expressions inside parentheses first. Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5, which equals 7. So, we replace that part of the expression with 7. 

Now we have 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. 

Next, we need to multiply and divide from left to right. We have 4 * 7, which equals 28. So, we replace that part of the expression with 28. 

Now we have 28 + 12 - 2 * 3. 

Next, we need to multiply 2 and 3, which equals 6. So, we replace that part of the expression with 6. 

Now we have 28 + 12 - 6. 

Finally, we need to add and subtract from left to right. We have 28 + 12, which equals 40. So, we replace that part of the expression with 40. 

Now we have 40 - 6. 

Finally, we subtract 6 from 40. 

The answer is 34."

gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Hmm, I don't know much about order of operations, but I remember that when doing math, we usually do multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. So, I should calculate 2 multiplied by 4 first. That gives me 8. Then I can add 5 to 8. The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will multiply 7 by 2 which gives me 14. Then, I will multiply 8 by 5 which gives me 40. Finally, I will add the two results together: 14 + 40 = 54.

gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Hmm, I don't know much about order of operations, but I remember that when doing calculations, we usually do the multiplication before addition. So, I'll start by multiplying 4 and 3, which gives me 12. Then, I will add 2 to that. 

So, 4 * 3 + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14.

Therefore, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will use the order of operations (PEMDAS). First, I will solve the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, I add 2 and 5 to get 7. 

Now I have 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. 

Next, I will solve the multiplication. Multiplying 4 by 7 gives me 28 and multiplying 2 by 3 gives me 6. 

Now I have 28 + 12 - 6. 

Finally, I will do the addition and subtraction from left to right. Adding 28 and 12 gives me 40, and then subtracting 6 gives me 34. 

The answer is 34."
