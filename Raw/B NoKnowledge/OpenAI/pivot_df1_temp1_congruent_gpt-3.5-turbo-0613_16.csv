gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to use the order of operations. First, we need to multiply 2 by 4, which gives us 8. Then, we add 5 to 8. 

So, the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: First, we need to multiply 7 by 2 which equals 14. 
Then, we multiply 8 by 5 which equals 40. 
Finally, we add 14 and 40 which equals 54.
So, the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. First, we multiply 4 by 3 to get 12. Then, we add 2. 

So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, we need to solve any operations inside parentheses. In this case, we have (2 + 5) which equals 7. 

Next, we need to solve any multiplication or division from left to right. In this case, we have 4 * 7 which equals 28.

Then, we need to solve any addition or subtraction from left to right. In this case, we have 28 + 12 which equals 40.

Finally, we have 2 * 3 which equals 6. 

Now, we can solve the final equation: 40 - 6. 

The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to use the order of operations. First, we need to multiply 3 and 2, which gives us 6. Then, we add 5 to 6. 

So, the answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: First, we have to multiply 2 and 4. 
So, 2 * 4 equals 8.
After that, we add 5 and 8. 
Therefore, the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to multiply first. I will multiply 7 and 2, which equals 14. Then I will multiply 8 and 5, which equals 40. Finally, I will add 14 and 40. So, the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will follow the order of operations. First, I will multiply 4 and 3, which equals 12. Then, I will add 2 to 12, which equals 14. 
So, the final answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will follow the order of operations, which stands for parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division from left to right, and addition and subtraction from left to right. 

First, I will start with the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5, which equals 7.

Then, I will move on to the multiplication and division. There are two multiplication operations: 4 * 7 and 2 * 3. 

The multiplication 4 * 7 equals 28. 

The multiplication 2 * 3 equals 6.

Next, I will perform the addition and subtraction. We have 28 + 12 - 6. 

The addition 28 + 12 equals 40.

Finally, I will subtract 6 from 40. 

The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: First, I will add 5 and 3, which equals 8. Then, I will multiply 8 by 2, which equals 16. 

The answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Um, okay, let me think. So, I see we have 5 plus 2 times 4. I don't really know what to do first, but I remember my teacher said that sometimes we need to do multiplication or division before addition or subtraction. So, I think I will do the multiplication first. 2 times 4 is 8. And then I will add 5 to 8. So, the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Um, I don't really know what to do when there's a multiplication and addition together. But maybe I can do the multiplications first and then add the results. So, 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40. Then I can add 14 and 40 together. Um, the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Um, okay, let me think. First, I see the multiplication sign between 4 and 3, so I should do that first. 4 multiplied by 3 is 12. Then, there's a plus sign after that, so I just add the 2. 12 plus 2 is 14. So the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, we need to add the numbers in parentheses, which is 2 + 5 = 7. 
Then, we multiply 4 by 7, which is 28. 
Next, we add 28 with 12, giving us 40. 
After that, we multiply 2 by 3, which is 6. 
Finally, we subtract 6 from 40, resulting in 34. 

So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Um, okay, so I don't really know anything about order of operations, but I see that there's some addition and multiplication going on. Maybe I can just solve it from left to right? So, 5 plus 3 is 8, and then times 2... umm... I guess I just do that next. So, 8 times 2 is... uh... 16? I think the answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will start by adding 5 and 2. So, 5 + 2 equals 7. Then, I will multiply 7 by 4. 7 * 4 equals 28. Therefore, the answer is 28."
