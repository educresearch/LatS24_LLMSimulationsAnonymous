      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. First, we need to add 2 and 5 because they are inside parentheses. This gives us 7. Then, we multiply 4 and 7, which is 28. Next, we add 12 to 28, giving us 40. Lastly, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which is 6, from 40. So, the final answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to use the order of operations (PEMDAS). The P stands for parentheses, which means we need to solve anything inside parentheses first.<br><br>Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5, which equals 7. <br><br>Now we can simplify the expression: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, we need to multiply and divide from left to right. We start with 4 * 7, which equals 28.<br><br>Now our expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, we multiply 2 * 3, which equals 6. <br><br>Now our expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Finally, we add and subtract from left to right. <br><br>First, we add 28 + 12, which equals 40. <br><br>Now our expression becomes: 40 - 6.<br><br>Finally, we subtract 40 - 6, which equals 34.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I just need to follow the order of operations. First, I will do any calculations inside parentheses. In this case, there is (2 + 5), which equals 7. <br><br>Then I will do any multiplication or division from left to right. There are two multiplications: 4 * 7 and 2 * 3. <br><br>Finally, I will do any addition or subtraction from left to right.

      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us which calculations to do first. First, I start with any calculations inside parentheses, but there are no parentheses in this problem. Then, I move on to exponents, but there are no exponents in this problem either. Next, I do multiplication and division from left to right. Since there is multiplication in this problem, I need to multiply 2 and 4. 2 times 4 equals 8. Finally, I do addition and subtraction from left to right. Since there is addition, I need to add 5 and 8. 5 plus 8 equals 13. <br><br>So, the answer is 13.</td>
