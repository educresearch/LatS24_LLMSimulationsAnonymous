      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. First, we do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7. Then, we multiply 4 by the result: 4 * 7 = 28. After that, we do the multiplication of 2 and 3: 2 * 3 = 6. Finally, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 - 6 = 34. <br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I have to follow the order of operations which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). First, I see there are parentheses in the expression, so I need to simplify what's inside them first. Inside the parentheses, there is a plus operation, so I add 2 and 5 together which gives me 7. The expression now becomes 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. <br>Next, I see there is multiplication in the expression. Multiplication takes precedence over addition and subtraction, so I multiply 4 by 7 which gives me 28, and I multiply 2 by 3 which gives me 6. The expression now becomes 28 + 12 - 6.<br>Finally, I perform the addition and subtraction from left to right. First, I add 28 and 12 which gives me 40. Then, I subtract 6 from 40 which gives me 34.<br>Therefore, the final answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we need to start with the numbers inside the parentheses. So we have 2 + 5 which is 7. Then we multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. <br><br>Next, we have 12 - 2*3. We multiply 2 by 3 to get 6. Then we subtract 6 from 12 to get 6. <br><br>Finally, we add 28 and 6 together to get our final answer. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will go step by step and do the operations in the order they appear.<br><br>First, I see that there are parentheses, so I will solve what is inside them first. Inside the parentheses, there is 2 + 5, which equals 7.<br><br>Next, I will multiply 4 by the result of the parentheses, 7. So, 4 * 7 equals 28.<br><br>Then, I will add 12 to 28. This gives me 40.<br><br>After that, I will multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6.<br><br>Finally, I will subtract 6 from 40. So, 40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
