gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Okay, so I'm not really sure about the special rules but I think I have to do something with the numbers in the brackets first. So, if I look at the problem, there's a 2 plus 5 inside brackets. I'll add those together because that's what brackets usually mean, right?

2 + 5 equals 7.

Now the problem looks like this:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

I think I should just solve it from left to right like reading a book. So I'll multiply 4 and 7 first because that comes next.

4 * 7 equals 28.

Then we add 12 to that, right?

28 + 12 equals 40.

Then it says to subtract 2 times 3, but I'll do the 2 times 3 part first because it's like the brackets thing.

2 * 3 equals 6.

So now, we need to subtract 6 from 40.

40 - 6 equals 34.

So I think the answer is 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Okay, since I'm just learning this, I'll try to solve the problem step by step. First, I do what's inside the parentheses because that's what my teacher said to do first.

So (2 + 5) equals 7. Now the problem looks like this:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Then I think I'm supposed to do the multiplication before the addition and subtraction. So I'll multiply 4 times 7 which is 28, and then 2 times 3 which is 6. Now the problem is:

28 + 12 - 6

Now I'll just go left to right doing the addition and then the subtraction. So 28 plus 12 is 40, and 40 minus 6 is 34.

So the answer is 34.","GPT Response: Okay, since I don't know about the order of operations, I might just work from left to right, like I'm reading a book. So, I'll start with the first number and operation I see.

First, I would do 4 times 2 which is 8.

Then I see there is a plus and a 5, so I would add 5 to 8 which is 13.

Then I would multiply that by 4 because I think that all the multiplication happens at the same time. So, 13 times 4 is 52.

Now I add 12 to 52 which is 64.

Then I would subtract 2, so that would give me 62.

And finally, I'd multiply by 3. So, 62 times 3 is 186.

So, I would say the answer is 186.","GPT Response: Okay, so let's work this out! First, we need to do what's inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5. That equals 7. Then, we multiply that number by 4 because it's right outside the parentheses. So 4 times 7 is 28.

Then we have to add 12 to that, so 28 + 12 is 40.

Lastly, we need to subtract the product of 2 and 3 from that total. Multiplying 2 by 3 is 6. So we take our 40 and subtract 6, and that leaves us with 34.

So the final answer is 34!"
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Hm, I'm not really sure about any special rules, but I think I would just go from left to right like I read a book! So first I would take 4 times 3 because that comes first, which is 12. Then I would just add 2 to that. So the answer would be like 12 plus 2, which is 14!

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Since I haven't learned about the order of operations (PEMDAS) yet, I might just solve the problem from left to right.

So, I would first multiply 4 by 3, which is 12. 
Then, I would add the 2 to that result. 

So, 12 + 2 equals 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations yet, I might just solve from left to right. So I would multiply 4 and 3 first because that's the first thing I see. 

4 times 3 is 12, and then I would add 2 to that. So, 12 plus 2 is 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, my teacher said that we should do the multiplication part before we add. So, I will multiply 4 times 3 first. That gives me 12. Then, I add the 2 to that result. So, 12 plus 2 equals 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Hm, I'm not really sure about any special rules, but I think I would just go from left to right like I read a book! So first I would add 5 plus 2 to get 7, and then I would multiply that by 4. So it would be like 7 times 4 which is 28. 

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Oh, I remember my teacher told us about something like this. We can't just solve it from left to right, we have to do the multiplication part first before we add. So, here's how I would do it:

First, we do the multiplication part between 2 and 4.
2 * 4 = 8

Then, we add that to 5.
5 + 8 = 13

So, the answer is 13.","GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations yet, I would just solve from left to right. So I would add 5 plus 2 first, which is 7, and then multiply that by 4. So my equation would look like this:

5 + 2 = 7
7 * 4 = 28

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: When I do math problems, I like to work from left to right, just like when I'm reading a book! So here's how I'll try to solve it:

First, I see 5 plus 2, which is 7. Then I have 7 times 4, which is 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Hm, I'm not really sure about any special rules, but I think I would just do the operations from left to right, like reading a book. So first I would add 5 + 3, which is 8, and then I would multiply that by 2. So 8 times 2 is 16.

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Oh, I remember my teacher told us about something like this. We can't just solve it from left to right, we have to do the multiplication part first before we add. So, here's how I would do it:

First, we do the multiplication part between 3 and 2.
3 * 2 = 6

Then, we add that to 5.
5 + 6 = 11

So, the answer is 11.","GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations yet, I might just solve from left to right. So I would add 5 and 3 first, which is 8, and then multiply that by 2. So my answer would look like this:

5 + 3 = 8
8 * 2 = 16

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: First, my teacher said that in math I need to do multiplication before I do adding, so I will do 3 times 2 first which is 6. After that, I add the 5 to the 6, which is 11. 

The answer is 11."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Oh, I think I just do the math from left to right, like when I read a book. So first I will multiply 7 by 2, which is 14, then I add the 8, which makes 22, and then multiply that by 5. So the math looks like this now:

14 + 8 * 5

From there, I add the 14 and 8 first because that's the next step from left to right, getting:

22 * 5

And finally, I multiply 22 by 5, which is 110!

So I think the answer is 110.","GPT Response: Okay, so I'm not sure about the special rules for the order to do things in, but I think you do the multiplication first and then the addition. So, let's multiply the 7 by 2 first. That gets us 14. Then we multiply the 8 by 5 and that gets us 40. Now we just add the two results together. So we add 14 and 40. 

14 + 40 is 54.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Oh, I think you just do the math from left to right because I don't know about any special rules. So, I would say 7 times 2 is 14, then you add 8 to get 22, and then multiply that by 5 to get 110. So I think the answer is 110. 

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: Oh! I just learned this in class. My teacher said we have to do the multiplication parts before we do the addition part. So, first I will multiply 7 times 2, which is 14, and then 8 times 5, which is 40. After that, I add the two results togetherâ€”14 plus 40.

So let me do that:

7 times 2 is 14
8 times 5 is 40

Now I add them up: 14 + 40 equals 54.

The answer is 54."
