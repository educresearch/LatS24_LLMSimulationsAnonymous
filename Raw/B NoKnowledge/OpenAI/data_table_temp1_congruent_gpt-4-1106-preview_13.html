      <td>GPT Response: Um, I'm not really sure about all the rules for doing math with parentheses and stuff, but I think I remember my teacher talking about doing the math inside the parentheses first. So I would add the 2 plus 5 together which is 7. Then it says to multiply that by 4, so that would be 28. <br><br>After that, we have to add 12 to that number, so 28 plus 12 is 40. Then it says to subtract 2 times 3. Multiplying 2 by 3 is 6, so we take away 6 from 40. That leaves us with 34.<br><br>So I think the answer would be, "The answer is 34."</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I've been learning about this in class! So, when we do math problems, we have to do operations in a special order so that everyone gets the same answer. My teacher said we should remember "PEMDAS," which stands for:<br><br>- Parentheses<br>- Exponents<br>- Multiplication and Division (from left to right)<br>- Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)<br><br>First, look for parentheses and solve what's inside them. So here we go:<br><br>1. Inside the parentheses we have 2 + 5, which equals 7.<br><br>Now the equation looks like this:<br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next is multiplication and division. We have two multiplication operations we need to do. We do these from left to right.<br><br>2. Multiply 4 and 7 to get 28.<br>3. Multiply 2 and 3 to get 6.<br><br>Now the equation looks like this:<br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Finally, we do addition and subtraction from left to right.<br><br>4. Add 28 and 12 to get 40.<br>5. Subtract 6 from 40 to get 34.<br><br>So after following the order of operations, the final answer is 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I learned something like this before! First, I think we should add the numbers in the parentheses because it's like a small group that needs to be solved first. So, 2 plus 5 is 7. Then we have 4 times that number in the parentheses, so 4 times 7 is 28.<br><br>Now the equation looks like 28 plus 12 minus 2 times 3. I like adding before I do anything else, so I'd add 28 and 12 to get 40. And then I know that 2 times 3 is 6.<br><br>So now it looks like 40 minus 6. If I take away 6 from 40, I have 34 left.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, my teacher said that in math, we have to do things in a special order so that everyone gets the same answer. It's like a game with rules. The rule is called "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally" or something like that, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and then Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>So first, I have to look for parentheses and solve what's inside them. I see 2 + 5 in parentheses.<br><br>2 + 5 equals 7.<br><br>Then, I have to multiply or divide before I add or subtract. So I'll multiply 4 times what I got from inside the parentheses.<br><br>4 times 7 equals 28.<br><br>Next, I see there's some more multiplication. There's 2 times 3, so I have to solve that.<br><br>2 times 3 equals 6.<br><br>Now, I'll replace what I've figured out with the numbers and then add and subtract from left to right.<br><br>28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Adding 28 and 12 first is what I do next because it comes before subtraction.<br><br>28 + 12 equals 40.<br><br>Last, I take away 6 from 40 because that's the next thing to do.<br><br>40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>So, the answer to the problem is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>4*3 + 2</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, so I heard from my friend that when you have a math problem with multiplication and addition, you should do the multiplication part first before you add anything. So, I'll do that!<br><br>First, I multiply 4 times 3, which is 12. Then I remember that addition comes next, so I add 2 to 12. 12 plus 2 equals 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I might just solve this step by step from left to right.<br><br>First, I would do the multiplication because that seems more complex:<br>4 times 3 is 12.<br><br>Now I have:<br>12 + 2<br><br>Next, I would add the 2 to the 12.<br>12 plus 2 equals 14.<br><br>So, based on solving step by step from left to right, I would say:<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, since I don't know about the order of operations, I would probably just solve it from left to right as I see it. So I would first multiply 4 by 3, which gives me 12. Then I would add 2 to the 12. So, 12 plus 2 equals 14!<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! So I think we just do it in the order it's written. First, we have 4 times 3, which I know is 12 because if you have 4 groups of 3 things, that's 12 things. Then, after that, it says we add 2. So we just add 2 to our 12. So, 12 plus 2 is like having 12 cookies and then getting 2 more, which makes 14 cookies. So, I think the answer is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, so I heard from my friend that when you have a math problem with different things like multiplying and adding, there's a special way to do it. She called it "PEMDAS" or something, which stands for parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). But I don't really know how to use it yet. <br><br>If I just look at the problem 5 + 2*4, I think you're supposed to do the multiplying part before you do the adding part. So first, I would multiply 2 times 4 because that's multiplication and I guess that comes before addition. So 2 times 4 is 8. <br><br>Then, once I've done that, I would take the 8 and add it to 5 because that's all that's left to do. So 5 plus 8 is 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I'm just learning about this! My teacher said we have to do multiplication before addition. So first I have to multiply 2 by 4, which is 8. And then, I add the 5 to that. <br><br>So, 5 + 8 equals 13. <br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
