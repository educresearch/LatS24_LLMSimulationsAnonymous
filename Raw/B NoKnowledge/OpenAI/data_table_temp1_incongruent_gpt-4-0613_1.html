Now, our problem looks like this:<br><br>13+12-2*3<br><br>Next, we add 13 and 12 to get 25. Now, the equation looks like this:<br><br>25-2*3<br><br>Finally, we subtract 2 from 25, giving us 23, and multiply 23 by 3, which gives us 69. <br><br>The answer is 69.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: First, I'll do the addition: 2+5 is 7. Then, 4 times 7 is 28. And 12 minus 2 is 10. Then, I'll multiply 10 by 3, to get 30. Now, I'll add 28 and 30 together to get 58.<br><br>The answer is 58.</td>

So, the equation becomes 8 + 5 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, I'll do 8 + 5, which is 13. So, the equation becomes 13 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>After that, I'll do 13 + 12, which is 25.
