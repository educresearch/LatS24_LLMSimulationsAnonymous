      <td>4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Um, okay. So first, we do the operations inside the parentheses. That's 2 + 5, which is 7. Then we do the multiplication outside the parentheses. That's 4 * 7, which is 28. Then we do the multiplication for 2 * 3, which is 6. Then we finally do the addition and subtraction. So, 28 + 12 - 6 is 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I will do the operations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7. Then, I will multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. Next, I will multiply 2 by 3 to get 6. After that, I will add 28, 12, and 6 to get 46. So, the answer is 46.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication inside the parentheses: 4*(2 + 5) = 4*7 = 28. Then you do the multiplication outside the parentheses: 28 + 12 - 2*3 = 28 + 12 - 6. Finally, you do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 - 6 = 40 - 6 = 34. <br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I will solve the operations inside the parentheses. So, 2 + 5 equals 7. Then, I will multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. After that, I will solve 2 * 3, which equals 6. Then, I will add 12 to 28 and subtract 6 from the sum. This gives us 34. Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
