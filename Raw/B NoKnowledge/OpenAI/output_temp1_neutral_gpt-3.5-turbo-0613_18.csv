The order of operations is represented by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, there are no parentheses or exponents in this problem, so we can move on to the next step. 

Next, we need to perform the multiplication and division from left to right. There are two multiplications in this problem: 7 multiplied by 2, and 8 multiplied by 5. We can start with 7*2, which equals 14. Then, we can do 8*5, which equals 40.

Lastly, we need to perform the addition and subtraction from left to right. In this case, we only have addition. We add 14 and 40 together, which equals 54.

Therefore, the answer is 54."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: So, in this problem, we have to solve the numbers and operations step by step. First, I see there are parentheses, so I need to solve that part first. Inside the parentheses, it says 2+5, which equals to 7. 
Then, I see there is multiplication, so I need to solve that next. 4 times 7 equals 28. 
Next, I see addition and subtraction, so I solve those in order from left to right. 28 plus 12 is 40. 
Finally, 2 times 3 equals 6. 
Now, I need to subtract 6 from 40. So the final answer is 40-6, which equals 34. 
The answer is 34."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: In this math problem, we have to follow the order of operations. First, we need to do the multiplication, which is 3*2. This gives us 6. Then, we can add 6 to 5. 
So, 5+3*2 is equal to 5+6. Adding 5 and 6 gives us 11.

The answer is 11."
