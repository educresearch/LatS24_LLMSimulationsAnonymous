gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Oh, Mom just taught me this. It's like a secret code in math where you do things in a certain order so that everyone gets the same answer. I remember she said something about doing the ""P"" and the ""E"" things first, which are parentheses and exponents, but there aren't any exponents here. 

So, we start with the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5. That's easy, that's just 7. 

Now we have 4 times whatever is in the parentheses, so 4 * 7 plus 12 minus 2 times 3. 

After the parentheses, Mom said we do multiplication and division before addition and subtraction, so we do the 4 times 7, which is 28, and the 2 times 3, which is 6.

So now the problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.

Then we do addition and subtraction from left to right. So first, we add 28 and 12, which is 40. Then we subtract the 6, so 40 - 6. 

And 40 minus 6 is 34. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Oh, so I'm not sure about a rule called ""PEMDAS,"" but my teacher said that when I see math problems, I should do what's inside the parentheses first. So let's try that!

First, I see there's this (2+5) in the problem. So I'll add those numbers together.

2 + 5 = 7

Now the problem looks like this:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, my teacher mentioned that multiplication comes before addition and subtraction when they are in the same problem. So I have two multiplications here: 4 * 7 and 2 * 3.

Let's do those:

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now the problem looks like this:

28 + 12 - 6

Then I just go from left to right, doing addition and then subtraction.

First the addition:
28 + 12 = 40

And then the subtraction:
40 - 6 = 34

So, the final answer is 34.","GPT Response: Well, I'm just going to do the math the best way I think. So first I see 4 and 2+5, I think 4 times 2 is 8 and plus 5 is 13. Then I have to add 12 to it, so 13 plus 12 is 25. And then subtract, 2 times 3 is 6, so subtract that from 25. My final answer is 25 minus 6, which is 19. The answer is 19.","GPT Response: Oh, I remember the teacher talked about something called the ""Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally"" rule, which is a funny way to remember the order of operations. It stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So first, I'll do what's in the parentheses (2+5) which is 7.

Then, I will do the multiplications and divisions from left to right. So first is 4 times what I got in the parentheses, so 4*7 is 28.

There is another multiplication part, which is 2*3, and that's 6.

Now I just have to do the addition and subtraction, which is 28 (from the 4*7) plus 12 and then minus 6 (from the 2*3).

So, 28 plus 12 is 40, and then 40 minus 6 is 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about order of operations just yet, I might just calculate this from left to right as I see it.

First, I'd multiply 4 by 3 which gives me 12.
Then, I'd add 2 to 12, which would give me 14.

So, I'd think the answer is 14.","GPT Response: Oh, I think I can figure this out! First, I need to do the multiplication part because my teacher said that comes before addition. So, I multiply 4 times 3 which is 12. After that, I add 2 to that result. So 12 plus 2 is 14!

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Well, I don't know much about fancy rules, but I'd just solve this step by step from left to right because that's how I read! So first, I'd do the 4 times 3 because that comes first, and I know that's 12. Then I'd just add 2 at the end because that's the next thing to do.

So, it's like this: 4 times 3 is 12, and then I add 2 to get 14! 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Oh, okay! I know that when I have numbers and symbols, I should first do the multiplication before I do the addition. So here, I will first do 4 times 3 which is 12. After that, I will add 2 to 12. So that goes like:

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about order of operations just yet, I might just calculate this from left to right, like I read a sentence.

So, I would first add 5 + 2, which equals 7, and then I would multiply that sum by 4.

So, 7 multiplied by 4 equals 28.

Therefore, I would say, The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Oh, I remember the teacher talked about something that we need to follow a special rule when we see problems like this. It has to do with the order in which we do the operations like multiplying and adding. First, we have to do the multiplication before we do the addition.

So looking at 5 + 2 * 4, we have to multiply 2 and 4 first because multiplication comes before addition.

2 times 4 equals 8.

Now, we just have to add that result to 5.

So, 5 plus 8 equals 13.

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: Well, I don't know much about fancy rules for math, but I think you just do the math from left to right like reading a book. So I would add 5 plus 2 first, because that's what comes first, and that equals 7. Then I would take that 7 and multiply it by 4, because that's the next thing to do. So, 7 times 4 equals 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Oh, okay! I know that when I do math problems like this, I should do the multiplication part before I add. So first, I'll multiply 2 times 4, which is 8. Then, I'll add that to 5. So 5 plus 8 is 13.

The answer is 13."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about order of operations, I might just solve this from left to right. So, first I would add 5 + 3 to get 8, then I would multiply that by 2 to get 16. 

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Oh, I remember my teacher talked about this! When you have a math problem with different operations like multiplication and addition, you have to do the multiplication before the addition. That's because multiplication is like a bunch of additions put together.

So, I need to do the 3 times 2 part first. That's 3 multiplied by 2, which is 6.

After I've done the multiplication, I just have the addition left. So now my problem looks like this: 5 + 6.

Now I just add 5 and 6 together and that gives me 11.

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Well, I don't know much about fancy rules, but I think you just go from left to right. So first I do the 5 plus 3, which is 8, and then I multiply that by 2. So 8 times 2 is 16. 

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Oh, okay! I know that when I have numbers and plus signs and times signs in math, I should do the times part first. So first I do 3 times 2 which is 6, and then I add the 5. So it's like 5 plus 6, which is 11!

The answer is 11."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Um, okay, so I think I would just do the math from left to right because that's how I read. So first, I would do 7 times 2 which is 14, and then I would add 8 which makes 22, and then I would do 22 times 5. I'm not sure what that is exactly, but I think I can try to figure it out. 

So like, 20 times 5 is 100, and 2 times 5 is 10, so together that's 110. So I would say the answer is 110. But I heard there are some rules for the order to do things in math, but I don't really know them yet.","GPT Response: Since I don't know about order of operations yet, I might just do the operations from left to right as they appear.

First I would multiply 7 by 2, which is 14.

Then I would take the result, 14, and add 8 to it, so 14 + 8 is 22.

Next, I would multiply that sum, 22, by 5.

22 multiplied by 5 is 110.

Therefore, doing it this way, without knowing order of operations, I might think:

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: Oh, so I think you just do the math as you see it from left to right. So first, I'll multiply 7 times 2, which is 14. Then I'll just keep going and add 8. But then, there's another multiplication, so I have to do 8 times 5, which is 40. Now, I just have to add the 14 from before to the 40. So:

14 + 40 equals 54.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Oh, I know this! I can just solve it going from left to right, like a reading a book. So first, I do 7 times 2, which is 14. Next, I do 8 times 5, which is 40. Then, I just add those two together, so 14 plus 40 is 54. So, the answer is 54."
