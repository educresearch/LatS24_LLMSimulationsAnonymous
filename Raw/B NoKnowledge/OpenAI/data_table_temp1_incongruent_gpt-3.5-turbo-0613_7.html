      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to follow the order of operations. I don't know what PEMDAS is, but I'll just follow the operations from left to right.<br><br>First, I'll start with 4 * (2+5). I know that I have to do the addition before the multiplication, so 2+5 is 7. Then, I multiply 4 by 7 to get 28.<br><br>Next, I have +12. So I'll add 12 to 28, which gives me 40.<br><br>Then, I have -2 * 3. I'll do the multiplication first, which is 6. Then, I'll subtract 6 from 40, which gives me 34.<br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, this question looks a bit confusing to me. Let's see if I can understand it step by step. <br><br>First, I see that there are parentheses, so I need to solve whatever is inside them first. Inside the parentheses, I have 2 plus 5, which equals 7. <br><br>Now I have 4 times 7. Multiplying means doing the same thing over and over, so I need to add 7 four times. <br><br>7 + 7 = 14<br>14 + 7 = 21<br>21 + 7 = 28<br>28 + 7 = 35 <br><br>Now I also see the symbol * which means multiplication. Next to it, there is a 2. So, I need to multiply 2 by 3. <br><br>2 times 3 equals 6. <br><br>Now I have all the parts: 35 plus 12 minus 6. <br><br>To solve this, I will start from the left. <br><br>35 plus 12 equals 47. <br><br>Then, I have 47 minus 6. <br><br>Subtraction means taking away, so I need to take away 6 from 47. <br><br>47 minus 6 equals 41. <br><br>So, after solving each part step by step, the final answer is 41.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I will do the calculations inside the parentheses. <br><br>Inside the parentheses is 2 + 5. So I add 2 and 5, which equals 7. <br><br>Now, I have 4 * 7. Multiplying 4 and 7 gives me 28. <br><br>Next, I have 28 + 12. Adding 28 and 12 gives me 40. <br><br>Then, I have 2 * 3. Multiplying 2 and 3 gives me 6. <br><br>Finally, I have 40 - 6. Subtracting 6 from 40 gives me 34. <br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
