gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2*4,GPT Response: I don't know how to solve that.
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: First, I will multiply 7 and 2 together to get 14. Then, I will multiply 8 and 5 together to get 40. Finally, I will add 14 and 40 together to get the final answer. 

The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,GPT Response: I don't really know much about that... Maybe is it just 20?
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Um, so I think you do the stuff in the parentheses first, so that would be 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. Then you do the multiplication before the addition and subtraction, so it's 28 + 12 - 6. And then you just do the addition and subtraction left to right, so it's 40 - 6. Finally, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: I don't really know much about that, but is it just 16?"
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication of 2 and 4, which is 8. Then we add 5 to 8, which gives us 13. So, the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: First, I'll just solve the multiplication from left to right: 7*2 = 14, and 8*5 = 40. Then I'll add the two products together: 14 + 40 = 54. 
The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, you multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then you add 2 to 12, which gives you 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, I add the numbers inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7. Then, I do the multiplications and divisions from left to right: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6. Finally, I do the additions and subtractions from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40 and 40 - 6 = 34. 

The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication, so 3*2 equals 6. Then, you just add 5 to 6, which equals 11. 

The answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: First, I add 5 and 2 together. Then, I multiply the result by 4. 
The answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Umm, I think I just do the math from left to right. So, 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40. So, the answer is 14 + 40, which is 54. 
So, the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Um, I think you just do it from left to right, so it's 12 + 2. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, we do the numbers inside the parentheses. So, 2 + 5 is 7. Then we do the multiplication, so 4*7 is 28 and 2*3 is 6. After that, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So, 28 + 12 is 40, and 40 - 6 is 34. Finally, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: First, I add 5 and 3 together. Then, I multiply the result by 2. 
The answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: First, we do the operation of 2 times 4, which equals 8. Then we add 5 to 8. So, the answer is 13. The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Ok, so first I'll just do the multiplication from left to right. 
7 times 2 equals 14, and 8 times 5 equals 40.
Then I add the results together, so 14 plus 40 equals 54.
The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, we multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then we add 2. So the answer is 14. 
The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5. That gives us 7. Then, we do the multiplication next to the parentheses, 4 * 7, which is 28. Next, we do the multiplication next to 2, which is 2 * 3, which gives us 6. Finally, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right, so 28 + 12 - 6 gives us 34. That's our final answer!

The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication, 3*2 = 6. Then, we add 5 + 6 = 11.
