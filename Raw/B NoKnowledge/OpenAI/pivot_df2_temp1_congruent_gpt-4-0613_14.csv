gpt-4-0613,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, let's add 2 and 5 inside the parenthesis, which is 7. Then, multiply 4 with 7 which is 28. Add 28 and 12 together, that gives 40. Then, multiply 2 and 3 together, which is 6. Finally, subtract 40 by 6 which gives 34. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: I'm not sure about order of operations, so I'll just do everything from left to right.

First, I'll do 4*(2 + 5), which is 4*7, and that is 28.

Now I'll add 28 and 12, which gives me 40.

Then we subtract the 2, which leaves us with 38.

Finally, we multiply 3 by the 2, which gives us 6.

So, the final answer would be 38 - 6, which is 32.

The answer is 32.","GPT Response: I'll start by adding the 2 and 5 inside the parenthesis because they are together. So, 2 + 5 is 7. 
Then, I'll multiply the 4 outside with the result, that makes it 4*7, which equals 28. 
Now, we have ""28 + 12 - 2*3"".  
Next, I'll add up 28 and 12 to get 40 then subtract it by 2*3 which is 6. 

So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: Okay, so let me think:
First, in 4*(2 + 5), I'll add 2 and 5 to get 7. Then, I'll multiply that by 4 to get 28.
Then, I'll subtract 2*3, which is 6, from 12 to get 6,
Finally, I'll add the results 28 and 6 to get 34.
The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about order of operations (PEMDAS), I would solve the problem straight across. First, I multiply 4 and 3 together and get 12. Then, I add 2 to 12, which results in the final answer of 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, I will multiply 4 and 3 together which gives me 12. Then, I will add 2 to the 12. So, 12 plus 2 equals 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would just solve the problem from left to right. 

First, I would multiply 4 by 3, which is 12.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I might just calculate this question from left to right. First, I would add 5 and 2 together to get 7. Then, I would multiply 7 by 4 to get 28. 

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, I will add 5 plus 2, which totals 7. Then, I will multiply my result, 7, with 4 to get 28. So, the answer is 28.","GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I just solve the problem from left to right.
First, I do the addition. 5 + 2 is 7.
Now I do the multiplication. 7 * 4 is 28. 

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: As an elementary school student who doesn't know the order of operations yet, I would just do the math from left to right. So, first, I would add 5 + 2 which equals 7. Next, I would multiply that answer by 4. So, 7 times 4 equals 28.
