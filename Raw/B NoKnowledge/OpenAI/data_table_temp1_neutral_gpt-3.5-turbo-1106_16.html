      <td>GPT Response: Umm...I think I just do the operations from left to right, so first, I do 4*(2+5) which is 4*7, then I add 12 to that which is 28, then I subtract 2*3 which is 6. So the answer is 22.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First I will add the numbers inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.<br>Then I will multiply 4 by 7: 4 * 7 = 28.<br>Next, I will multiply 2 by 3: 2 * 3 = 6.<br>Then I will add the results together: 28 + 12 - 6 = 34.<br>So the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Umm, I think I just need to do the math in the order it's written. So first, I'll add 2 and 5. That equals 7. Then I'll multiply 4 by 7, which is 28. After that, I'll do 2 times 3, which is 6. Finally, I'll add 12 to 28 and subtract 6 from that total. So the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: So first, you have to do the operations inside the parentheses. <br>So 2+5 is 7. Then you can do the multiplication and addition in order from left to right. <br>4*7 is 28, and then 28+12 is 40. <br>And then 2*3 is 6. <br>Finally, you do the subtraction, so 40-6 is 34. <br>So the answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: So I just do the multiplication first, which is 4*3, and then add 2 to the result. So it's 12+2, which is 14. So, the answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Um, I don't really know how to do the order of operations, but my teacher always says we should do the multiplication or division first before adding or subtracting. So, I think we should do 4*3 first, which is 12, and then add 2. So, 12+2 is 14. <br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Um, I don't really know what to do here. Do I add the 5 and 2 first, or do I multiply 2 and 4 first? I think I'll just do the adding first. So, 5 + 2 is 7. Then I'll multiply 7 by 4, and that gives me 28.<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: So I just add 5 and 2 first, then multiply that sum with 4. It looks like this: (5+2)*4 = 7*4. Then I multiply 7 and 4 to get 28. <br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I'll do the operation with the multiplication and then the addition. So, 2*4 = 8, and then 5+8 = 13. <br>The answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: So, I don't know much about this order of operations thing, but I think I should first do the multiplication before the addition. So, I'll do 3*2 which equals 6, and then I'll add 5 to it, which is 11. The answer is 11.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: First, I just multiply 7 and 2 to get 14, and then I multiply 8 and 5 to get 40. After that, I add the two products together, so 14 + 40 equals 54. So the answer is 54.</td>
