So we do 2 + 5, and that equals 7.\n\nThen, we multiply that by 4 because multiplication comes before adding or subtracting. So 4 times 7 is 28.\n\nAfter that, we have to add 12 to our result. So, 28 plus 12 equals 40.\n\nNext, we have to do the subtraction and the other multiplication. We have \"- 2 * 3\" at the end, which is like saying \"2 times 3\" first because multiplication is before subtraction. So, 2 times 3 is 6.\n\nNow we take our 40, and subtract 6 because we already did the multiplication.
