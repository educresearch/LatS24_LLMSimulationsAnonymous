gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we can start by multiplying 4 by 3, which gives us 12. Then, we add 2 to 12, which equals 14. So the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. First, we do the operations inside the parentheses. 

Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5, which equals 7. 

So, the problem becomes 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. 

Next, we do the multiplication from left to right. 4 * 7 equals 28, and 2 * 3 equals 6. 

So, the problem becomes 28 + 12 - 6. 

Lastly, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right. 

28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 6 equals 34. 

Therefore, the answer is 34."

gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to remember that I have to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS). This stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division (from left to right), Addition, and Subtraction (from left to right).

But since I don't know how to use parentheses or exponents yet, I will first do the multiplication. So, I will multiply 2 by 4, which is equal to 8.

Then, I will add 5 to 8, which is equal to 13.

Therefore, the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to know about order of operations. The order is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this problem, there are only multiplication operations. So I will just calculate each multiplication separately and then add the results together.

First, I will do 7 * 2, which equals 14.
Then, I will do 8 * 5, which equals 40.

Finally, I will add 14 and 40 together to get the final answer.

The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to remember that I have to perform the multiplication before the addition. First, I multiply 4 by 3, which gives me 12. Then, I add 2 to 12. So the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I can calculate the expression step by step.

First, I will follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Inside the parentheses, I add 2 and 5, which equals 7.

Then, I multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28.

Next, I add 28 and 12, which equals 40.

After that, I subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which is 6, from 40.

So, the final answer is 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to remember that in Mathematics, there is a specific order in which operations should be done. This order is called the order of operations or PEMDAS. 

PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

In this problem, I don't have any parentheses or exponents, so I can skip those steps. 

Next, I see that I have multiplication. According to PEMDAS, I need to do the multiplication before the addition. So, I will first multiply 3 and 2, which equals 6. 

Lastly, I can add 5 to the product of the multiplication, which gives me the final answer. 

Therefore, the answer is 11."
