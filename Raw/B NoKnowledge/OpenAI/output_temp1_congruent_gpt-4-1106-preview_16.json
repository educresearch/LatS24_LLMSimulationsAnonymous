So we have 2 plus 5, and that is 7. Then, we should make that times 4, because there's a multiplication sign next to it and multiplication is like a bunch of adding the same number over and over. So 4 times 7 is 28.\n\nNow we have 28 and then we have to add 12 to it, because it comes after that in the problem. So 28 plus 12 is 40. \n\nThen we have to do the minus 2 times 3 part, which is another multiplication. Multiplying 2 times 3 is like saying 2 plus 2 plus 2, which is 6. So now we have to take away 6 from our 40 because that's what subtraction is, taking away.\n\nSo if we have 40 and we take away 6, we are left with 34.
