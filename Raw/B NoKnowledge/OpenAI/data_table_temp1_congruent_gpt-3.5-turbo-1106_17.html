      <td>GPT Response: Um, I don't really know about these operations in Math, but I guess I'll just do them one by one. First, I'll add 2 and 5, which is 7. Then I'll multiply 4 by 7, which is 28. After that, I'll multiply 2 by 3, which is 6. Then I'll just add and subtract the numbers as they come, so 28 plus 12 is 40, and then minus 6 is 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I don't know how to solve this using order of operations. Can you please explain it to me? <br><br>The answer is 38.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I solve the numbers inside the parentheses, so 2 + 5 equals 7. Then I multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. Then I multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. Then I add 12 to 28, which equals 40. Finally, I subtract 6 from 40, and the answer is 34. <br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I will do what is inside the parentheses: 2+5=7. Then, I will multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. After that, I will multiply 2 by 3 to get 6. Lastly, I will add and subtract the numbers. So, 28 + 12 - 6 = 34. Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
