      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I'll just solve this from left to right.<br><br>First, I'll multiply 4 with 2, which gives 8. Then I'll add 5, and get 8 + 5 = 13. After that I add 12, and get 13 + 12 = 25. Lastly, I subtract 2 and multiply by 3 getting 25 - 2 * 3 = 23 * 3 = 69.<br><br>The answer is 69.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know the PEMDAS rule, I will just do the operations in the order they appear.<br><br>First, I'll do the multiplication: 4*(2+5) which is 4*7=28.<br><br>So, the equation becomes: 28 + 12 - 2*3.<br><br>Next, I'll do the addition: 28 + 12 = 40.<br><br>This changes the equation to: 40 - 2*3.<br><br>Again, I'll do the multiplication: 2*3 = 6.<br><br>So, the last step is: 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I will add 2 and 5 together because they are in parentheses and that will give me 7. Then, I will multiply that by 4 because multiplication comes before addition in the problem. That gives me 28.<br><br>Next, I'm going to add 12 to 28 because addition is the next operation in the problem. That gives me 40.<br><br>Finally, I'm going to subtract 2 times 3 from 40 because subtraction is the last operation in the problem. 2 times 3 is 6, so if I subtract 6 from 40, that gives me 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we add the 2 and 5 together because it's in brackets and we get 7. Then, we multiply that 7 by 4, which gives us 28. <br><br>Next, we have to add 12 to that 28, which gives us 40.<br><br>After that, we multiply 2 by 3 and get 6.<br><br>Finally, we subtract that 6 from 40 for our final answer.<br><br>Let's do it: <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
