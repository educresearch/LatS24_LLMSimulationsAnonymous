      <td>GPT Response: Well, since I don't know much about the order of operations yet, I might just try to solve the problem from left to right, just like I read a sentence. I'll start with the first thing I see:<br><br>First, I see 4*(2+5), so I'll do that part:<br>4*(2+5) = 4*7 because 2 plus 5 equals 7.<br><br>Next I multiply the 4 by 7, which gives me 28.<br><br>After that, I have:<br>28 + 12 which is 40.<br><br>And then I subtract 2 times 3 from 40. So, 2 times 3 equals 6.<br><br>Finally, subtracting 6 from 40, I get 34.<br><br>So, I think the answer is 34. But since I'm not sure about these rules, I should probably check with my teacher or someone else who knows them to make sure I did it right!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I've heard from my teacher that when we do math problems, we have to follow certain rules about which parts of the problem to solve first. I think it's called the order of operations. Let me try to remember what my teacher said:<br><br>1. We do anything inside parentheses first. So I should start with what's in the parentheses: (2+5)<br>2. Then we do any exponents, but there aren't any in this problem.<br>3. After that, we do any multiplication or division, from left to right.<br>4. Lastly, we do any addition or subtraction, from left to right.<br><br>So let me solve the problem using these steps:<br><br>First, the parentheses:<br>2+5 = 7<br><br>Then, the equation looks like this without the parentheses:<br>4*7+12-2*3<br><br>Now, multiplication:<br>4*7 = 28<br>2*3 = 6<br><br>So we get:<br>28+12-6<br><br>Lastly, do the addition and subtraction from left to right:<br>28+12 = 40<br>40-6 = 34<br><br>So after using the rules, the answer looks like it should be:<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations yet, I might just do the math from left to right like I read a sentence.<br><br>First, I'll multiply 4 by 2, which is 8.<br><br>Then I'll add 5 to that, so 8 + 5 is 13.<br><br>After that, I'll add 12, so 13 + 12 is 25.<br><br>Then, I subtract 2, so 25 - 2 gives me 23.<br><br>Finally, I need to multiply by 3, so 23 times 3 is 69.<br><br>So I might think the answer is 69.<br><br>The answer is 69.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm in elementary school and I don't know about order of operations, I might just do the math from left to right like I would read a sentence. So I would first do 4 times 2 which is 8, then add 5 to get 13. After that, I would multiply that by 4 to get 52. Then I would add 12 to make 64, subtract 2 to get 62, and finally multiply by 3 to get 186. But my teacher told me that's not quite right because there are special rules for which order to do the math in. <br><br>The answer is... actually, I think I need to learn about the order of operations to figure it out for real!</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, I think you just do the math from left to right, like reading! So first I'll multiply 4 times 3 which is 12. And then I add 2 to that. So 12 plus 2 is 14. So, I think the answer is 14. <br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

Then I would add 2 to that result. <br><br>4 * 3 = 12<br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>So doing it this way, I would say:<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I don't really know about any special rules for the order of how to do things in math. So I'm just going to solve it the way it makes sense to me by going left to right, like when I read a book!<br><br>First, I have 4 times 3, which I think is 12 because 4 three times is 12. Then I just have to add 2 to it. So if I have 12 and I add 2, that makes 14!<br><br>So, the answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I think we need to do the times part first and then add the last number. My teacher says we always do the multiplication before addition. So, 4 times 3 is 12, and then if we add 2 to that, we get 14. So, I think the answer is 14. The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, I think you just do the math from left to right. So I would first add 5 + 2 which is 7, and then multiply it by 4 which would give me 28. So I'd say the answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations yet, I might just calculate from left to right. So I first add 5 and 2 to get 7, and then I multiply 7 by 4 to get 28. <br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, since I don't know about order of operations, I'd probably just calculate this straight from left to right! So I'd do the addition first, because it's the first thing I see. <br><br>5 + 2 is 7.<br><br>Then I'd take that 7 and multiply it by 4, because that's the next thing in the question.<br><br>7 times 4 is 28.<br><br>So, I'd say the answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: When you have a math problem like 5 + 2 * 4, you need to do the multiplication part before you do the addition part. So first, you would multiply 2 by 4, which is 8. After that, you would add the 5. So it would look like this when you put it all together:<br><br>2 * 4 = 8<br>5 + 8 = 13<br><br>So, when you do the multiplication before the addition, the answer is 13. The answer is 13.</td>

Then I multiply that result by 2, which gives me 16.<br><br>So I might say, the answer is 16. <br><br>But if I learn about the order of operations later, I would find out that I need to do the multiplication before the addition. That would change my answer, because 3 times 2 is 6, and adding 5 would give me 11, which is actually the correct answer. But for now, with what I know, my answer is 16.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: When you do math problems with different operations like adding and multiplying, you should do the multiplying part before you add. So for 3 times 2, you get 6. Then you add the 5. So 5 plus 6 is 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
