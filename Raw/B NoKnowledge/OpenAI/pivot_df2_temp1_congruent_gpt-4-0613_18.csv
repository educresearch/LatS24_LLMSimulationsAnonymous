gpt-4-0613,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, I'll start by adding 2 and 5 which gives us 7. Then, I'll multiply 4 and 7 together and I get 28. Next, I'll add 28 and 12 together which gives me 40. Then, I'll multiply 2 and 3, which gives me 6. The final step would be to subtract 6 from 40 which gives me 34. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Since I don't know anything about order of operations (PEMDAS), I'll solve the problem from left to right:

First, I'll do the multiplication: 4 times 2 is 8. And then I'll add 5 to get 13.
Then, I'll add 12 to get 25.
Finally, I'll subtract 2 times 3 (which is 6) to get 19.

So The answer is 19.","GPT Response: First, I would add 2 + 5 to get 7. Then, I would multiply 4 with my result (7) to get 28. After that, I would subtract 2 from 3 to get 1 and multiply it by 2. So, I got 2 here. Next, I will add the first result and 12 to get 40. Finally, I would subtract my second result (2) from 40.

The answer is 38.","GPT Response: So, first I add the 2 and 5 together which is 7. Then, I multiply that by 4 and get 28. After that, I add 12 to 28, which is 40. Then at the end, I multiply 2 by 3 and got 6. Then I subtract 6 from 40 and got 34!

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations, I would solve this problem from left to right. First, I would multiply 4 by 3, which equals 12. Then I would add 2.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, I'll multiply 4 and 3 because that's the first part I see, which equals 12. Then, I'll add 2 to 12, which equals 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: As an elementary school student who doesn't understand the order of operations, I would simply work from left to right. So, I would do the multiplication first, getting a result of 12. Then, I would add the 2, ending with a total of 14.

Therefore, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a student who doesn't know about the order of operations in Mathematics, I would solve this problem from left to right, the way we read. So, first, I would multiply 4 by 3, getting 12. Then, I would add the 2 to the 12, resulting in 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations, I would solve this problem from left to right, which is the way I read a book. 

First, I would add 5 and 2 together to get 7. 

Then, I would multiply that result by 4 to get 28. 

So, I think, the answer is 28.","GPT Response: As a 6th grader who doesn't know about the order of operations, I might think of doing the math from left to right, just like reading. So, I would first add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then, I'd multiply that by 4 to get 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: As an elementary school student who doesn't understand order of operations (PEMDAS), I would solve this math problem from left to right, the same way I read a book. 

First, I would add 5 and 2 together to get 7. 

Then, I would multiply that 7 by 4.

7 multiplied by 4 equals 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: So I think what you do is you first add the 5 and the 2 to get 7, and then multiply that by 4 to get 28. 

The answer is 28."

gpt-4-0613,1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Since I'm not aware about the order of operations, I would simply perform these operations from left to right. First, I would multiply 7 by 2 to get 14. Then, I would add the result of 14 to 8, getting 22. Finally, I would multiply 22 by 5, giving me 110.

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: Based on what I know, I'd solve this problem step by step from left to right. 

First, I would multiply 7 by 2, which would equal 14. 

Next, I would add 14 to 8, which gives me 22. 

Then, I would multiply the result of 22 by 5, which equals 110. 

Therefore, the answer to the problem is 110. 

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: First, I would multiply 7 by 2 which gives 14. Then, I will multiply 8 by 5 which equals to 40. And finally, I will add 14 and 40 together to get 54.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Well, what I would do first is to multiply 7 by 2, which gives me 14. Then I would multiply 8 by 5, and that gives me 40. To find the final answer, I would add these two results together.
