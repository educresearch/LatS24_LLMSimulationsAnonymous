gpt-4-0613,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about order of operations, I would just solve it from left to right. Here's how I would do it:

First, I would multiply 4 by 2 which gives 8.
Then, I would add 5 to 8 which gives 13.
After that, I would add 12 to 13 which gives 25.
Then, I would subtract 2 from 25 which gives 23.
And lastly, I would multiply 23 by 3 which gives 69.

The answer is 69.","GPT Response: Well I think first we just go from left to right, right? So first I would add 2+5 to get 7. Then I would multiply that by 4 to get 28. After that, adding 12 to it will give us 40. And lastly, we should subtract 2 times 3, which is 6, resulting in a final result of 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I would add 2 and 5 because they are inside brackets, which give me 7. Then, 4 multiplied by the sum of 2 and 5 (which is 7) would be 28. 

Next, I would add 12 to 28 and get 40. Then, multiply 2 by 3 to get 6 and subtract it from the 40. 

So my calculation looks like this: 4*(2+5) is 28, 28+12 is 40, 40-2*3 is 40-6, which is 34. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: So I think you just add and subtract and multiply everything in the order you see them. 

First, you do 4 times 2 which is 8, then add 5 to get 13. Then you add 12 to 13 and you have 25. Lastly, you subtract 6 because 2 times 3 is 6. So, 25 minus 6 is 19.

The answer is 19."
gpt-4-0613,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would just solve the problem from left to right. 

First, I would multiply 4 and 3 together, which equals 12.
Then, I would add 2 to the result (12), which equals 14.

So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a 6th grader who doesn't know about the order of operations, I would first multiply 4 by 3 to get 12. After that, I would add 2 to get 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Since I haven't learned about the order of operations yet, I'll just solve the problem in the order that it's written. So first, I'll multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then, I'll add 2 to 12 which gives me 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Well, from what I know as an elementary school student, I tend to think we just go from left to right, like when we're reading. So I'd first multiply 4 by 3 which gives us 12, then I add 2 to 12, giving us 14. So:

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would just solve the problem from left to right. 

First, I would add 5 + 2 which equals 7. Then, I would multiply 7 * 4 which equals 28. 

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: As a 6th grader who doesn't know about the order of operations, I would first add 5 and 2 to get 7. After that, I would multiply 7 by 4 to get 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: First I would add 5 and 2 together which gives 7, then I would multiply 7 by 4 which gives 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Well, I haven't learned about order of operations (whatever that is). Because of this, I will just solve the problem starting from the left to the right.

First, I will take 5 plus 2, which gives me 7.
Then, I will take 7 (from previous step) multiply by 4, which gives me 28.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would just solve the problem from left to right. 

First, I would add 5 + 3 which equals 8. Then, I would multiply 8 * 2 which equals 16. 

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: As a 6th grader who doesn't know about the order of operations, I would first add 5 and 3 to get 8. After that, I would multiply 8 by 2 to get 16.

gpt-4-0613,1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: As I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would solve the math problem from left to right.

First, I would multiply 7 times 2, which is 14. Then, add 8 to 14, which is 22. Finally, I would multiply 22 times 5, giving me the answer.

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: Well, since I don't know the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will just calculate it from left to right. So, first, I will multiply 7 and 2, which gives me 14. Then, I will add the result, which is 14, to 8, to get 22. Then I will multiply that number by 5.

Here's how my work looks: 
7*2 = 14,
14+8 = 22,
22*5 = 110.

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: I'll solve this problem by simply doing the operations from left to right because I don't know about the order of operations. 

First, 7*2 is 14. Then I'll add 8 to 14, which is 22. Finally, I'll multiply 22 by 5, and the result is 110.

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: First, I will multiply 7 by 2, I think that's correct. And that gives me 14. After that, I should also multiply 8 by 5, which equals 40. Lastly, if I add them all together, 14 + 40 is 54.

The answer is 54."
