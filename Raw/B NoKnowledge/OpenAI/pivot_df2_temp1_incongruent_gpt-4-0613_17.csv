gpt-4-0613,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Since I am not familiar with the order of operations, I would solve this equation from left to right, the same way I would read a book.

First, I would solve the operation in the brackets:
4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3 becomes 4 * 7+12-2 * 3.

Next, I would multiply 4 by 7:
4 * 7+12-2 * 3 becomes 28+12-2 * 3.

Then, I would add 28 to 12:
28+12-2 * 3 becomes 40-2 * 3.

After that, I would subtract 2 from 40:
40-2 * 3 becomes 38 * 3.

Finally, I would multiply 38 by 3 to get 114.

The answer is 114.","GPT Response: I'm not so sure because I don't know what PEMDAS is, but I'll try my best! 

I know that you have to do multiplication and division before addition and subtraction, so I'll start with that. Here we go:

First, I notice there's a number inside brackets. Maybe I should do that first: 

2+5 which equals 7.

So now the equation looks like this 4 * 7+12-2 * 3. 

Next, I will do the multiplication:

4*7 equals 28, and 2 * 3 gives us 6.

Now the equation looks like this 28+12-6.

Now, I will do the addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 equals 40. 

Then subtract 6 from 40, we will get 34. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I am going to solve the problem from left to right, as I would read a sentence.

First I see 4 times 2 which is 8, then I add 5 and I get 13. Then I add 12 to 13 and get 25. Then, I subtract 2, so 25 becomes 23. Finally, I multiply 3 by 23 and get 69.

The answer is 69.","GPT Response: First let's add 2 and 5 so we have 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.
After that, we multiply 4 and 7 to get 28 and then we multiply 2 and 3 to get 6, so now we have 28 + 12 - 6.
Then, adding 28 and 12 makes it 40, and when you take away 6, it's 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would calculate the problem from left to right as I see it.

First, I would multiply 4 by 3 which gives 12.

Then, I would add 2 to the 12 I got from the multiplication. 

12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Since I am a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I'll solve the problem from left to right. First, I'll multiply 4 and 3 which gives me 12. Then, I'll add 2 to 12 which gives me 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Since I'm supposed to solve this from left to right, I would first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then, I would add the 2 to get 14.

gpt-4-0613,1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: I'm not sure about this order of operations thing, but I'm going to solve this problem left to right as I always do. So, let's see:

First, I will multiply 7 by 2, that equals 14. 
Next, I'll add the 8 to 14, which gives me 22. 
Lastly, I'll multiply 22 by 5. 

So, the answer should be 110.
