      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I would first add the numbers in the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7. Then I would multiply 4 by 7, which gives me 28. Next, I would multiply 2 by 3, which is 6. Finally, I would subtract 6 from 28 and add 12 to get the final answer. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will follow the order of operations. This means that I will solve any addition or subtraction inside parentheses first. Then, I will multiply or divide from left to right. Finally, I will do any remaining addition or subtraction.<br><br>In the given expression, there are no parentheses, so I will start by multiplying 4 with the sum of 2 and 5. This gives me 4 multiplied by 7.<br><br>Next, I will add 12 to the result from the previous step. This gives me 28.<br><br>Then, I will subtract 2 multiplied by 3 from the previous result. This gives me 22.<br><br>Therefore, the final answer is 22.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Um, I'm not really sure about this, but I'll just do the calculations one by one. First, I'll do 4 * (2+5). That's 4 times 7, which is 28. Then I'll add 12 to that, which is 40. Next, I'll multiply 2 by 3, which is 6, and subtract that from 40. So the final answer is 34. Um, yeah, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we need to solve the part in the parentheses. So we add 2 and 5, which equals 7. <br><br>Then, we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. <br><br>Next, we add 28 to 12, which equals 40. <br><br>Finally, we subtract 2 times 3, which is 6, from 40. <br><br>So the final answer is 34.</td>
