gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, we need to start by solving the expression inside the parentheses. Adding 2 and 5 gives us 7. 

Next, we calculate the multiplication on the outside. Multiplying 4 by 7 gives us 28.

Then, we need to solve the multiplication on the right. Multiplying 2 by 3 gives us 6.

Now, we can simplify the expression further. Subtracting 6 from 28 gives us 22.

Finally, we add 12 to 22 to get the final answer. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we need to solve the numbers inside the parentheses. The numbers inside the parentheses are 2 and 5, and we add them together to get 7. 

The expression now becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. 

Next, we need to multiply. The multiplication we need to do is 4 * 7, which equals 28. 

Now the expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3. 

Next, we need to solve the multiplication again. The multiplication we need to do is 2 * 3, which equals 6. 

The expression now becomes: 28 + 12 - 6. 

Finally, we perform the addition and subtraction in order from left to right. 

28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 6 equals 34. 

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to follow a specific order. First, I need to calculate what is inside the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, I add 2 and 5 together, which equals 7. Now, the problem becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, I need to do the multiplication. 4 multiplied by 7 is 28, and 2 multiplied by 3 is 6. Now, I have: 28 + 12 - 6.

Finally, I can do the addition and subtraction. 28 plus 12 is 40, and 40 minus 6 is 34.

So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: Okay, so here's what I did. First, I saw the numbers in parentheses, 2 and 5. I added them together to get 7. Then I multiplied 4 by 7 to get 28. After that, I added 12 to 28 to get 40. And finally, I saw 2 times 3 and got 6. So, I subtracted 6 from 40 to get 34. 
The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. The first operation to do is the multiplication, so we multiply 4 by 3, which equals 12. Then, we add 2 to 12, which equals 14. 
So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve the given problem, I will multiply 4 by 3 first, since multiplication comes before addition. This will give me 12. Then, I will add 2 to get the final answer.

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: To solve the problem, I will calculate the multiplication first and then add the result to 5. So, 3 multiplied by 2 is 6. Then, I will add 6 to 5. The answer is 11.","GPT Response: First, we need to follow the order of operations. We start by doing the multiplication first, which means we need to multiply 3 and 2. So, 3 multiplied by 2 is 6. Then, we add 5 and 6. 5 plus 6 is 11. 
Therefore, the answer is 11.","GPT Response: Hi! So in this problem, we have 5 plus 3 times 2. But I'm not sure what to do first. Without knowing anything about order of operations, I'll just solve it from left to right. So 5 plus 3 is 8. And then I have to multiply 8 by 2. So, I think the answer is 8 times 2 which is 16. 

The answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we should follow the order of operations. We start by multiplying 7 and 2, then add the product to the product of 8 and 5.
