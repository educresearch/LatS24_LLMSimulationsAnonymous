gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I'll just perform the operations from left to right. 

First, I'll add 5 and 2 to get 7. 

Then, I'll multiply 7 by 4 to get 28. 

So, the answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: As a 6th grader with no knowledge of the order of operations, I would just solve this problem from left to right. So my steps would be as follows: 

First, I would multiply 7 by 2, which gives me 14. 

Then, I'll add 14 and 8, which results to 22.

Lastly, I'll multiply 22 by 5 which gives me 110.

So the answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I'll just perform the operations from left to right. 

First, I multiply 4 by 3, which gives me 12.

Then, I add 2 to 12, which gives me 14.

So, the answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, I'll just add everything that can be added and subtract everything that can be subtracted. So my steps would be something like this:

First, I add 2 and 5 which gives me 7.
Then, I multiply 4 with this 7 which gives me 28.
Next, I add 12 to this 28 and get 40.
Lastly, I subtract 2*3 (which is 6) from this 40 and I get 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I'll just perform the operations from left to right. 

First, I'll add 5 and 3 to get 8. 

Then, I'll multiply 8 by 2 to get 16. 

So, the answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: As a 6th grader who doesn't know about the order of operations, I would solve this problem by going from left to right. Firstly, I would add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then, I would multiply my result, which is 7, by 4 to get 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: First, I would start by doing the multiplication. I would multiply 7 by 2, which is 14. Then, I would multiply 8 by 5, which is 40. After that, I'm going to add these two sums together. So, 14 plus 40 is 54.

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, we multiply 4 and 3 which gives 12. Then, we add 12 and 2 which gives a total of 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Well, I only know how to solve them going from left to right, like a reading book. So, here's how I will do it:

First, I'd solve the part inside the parentheses (2+5), which is 7.
Then I'd multiply 4 by this result (4*7), which gives me 28.
After that, I'd add 12 to this result (28+12) and that gives me 40.
Then, I would subtract 2 from this result (40-2) to get 38.
Finally, I multiply that answer by 3 (38*3) to get 114.

So, the answer is 114."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: As I don't know the order of operations, I will only solve this problem from left to right. 

First, I will add 5 and 3, which is 8. Then I will multiply the result (8) with 2. So, 8*2 equals 16.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: I would add the 5 and the 2 together first to get 7. Then, I would multiply the 7 by 4 to get 28. So, I think the answer is 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Since I haven't learned about order of operations, I'll just solve the problem from left to right, as if I were reading it.

First, I'll do 7*2, which equals 14. So now the equation is 14 + 8*5.

Next, I'll do 14 + 8, which equals 22. So now the equation is 22*5.

Finally, I'll do 22*5, which equals 110.

The answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: I would begin by multiplying 4 and 3 since that's the first operation I see from left to right. I'd get 12. Then, I'd add this to 2, since that's the next operation I see in this problem from left to right. That would give me a final answer.

4*3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, I know addition and multiplication are important, so I will start with those. Here is what I do: 

I know that 2 + 5 equals 7. So, 4 * (2 + 5) just means 4 * 7 which equals to 28.
Then I add 12, getting us 40 (28 + 12). 
After that, I subtract 2 * 3 (which is 6), from 40. That leaves us with 34. 

So, the answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: I would add the 5 and the 3 to get 8. After that, I would multiply 8 by 2 to get 16.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: As a student who doesn't understand order of operations, I will straightforwardly add and multiply in the order the numbers appear. 

First, I'll add 5 and 2 to get 7. 

Next, I'll multiply that 7 with 4 to get my final answer.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: So first I'll add 7 and 2 to get 9. Then I'll add 8 and 5 to get 13. After that, I'll multiply 9 by 13 to finally get 117. 

The answer is 117."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, I'll do the multiplication 4*3 which equals 12. Then, I'll add the 2. So, 12 + 2 equals 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Well, I know that 4 times 2 is 8, and 4 times 5 is 20. And then I know that 8 plus 20 is 28. I'd also add the 12 to my 28 to get 40. Then, at the end, I know 2 times 3 is 6, and I deduct 6 from 40 to get 34.
The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: As a student who doesn't understand order of operations, I will straightforwardly add and multiply in the order the numbers appear.
