gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, you need to follow the order of operations. First, you need to solve the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, 2 + 5 equals 7. So, you have 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. Next, you need to multiply and divide from left to right. So, 4 * 7 equals 28 and 2 * 3 equals 6. Now, you have 28 + 12 - 6. Finally, you need to add and subtract from left to right. 28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 6 equals 34. 
The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will follow the order of operations (PEMDAS). First, I need to solve the expression inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5. This equals 7. 

Next, I will multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. 

Then, I will subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which equals 6. 

Finally, I will add the results of 28 and 12, which equals 40. 

Therefore, the answer is 40.","GPT Response: I would solve this problem by following the steps in the order they appear. First, I would add 2 and 5 together, which equals 7. Then, I would multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. Next, I would add 12 to 28, which equals 40. After that, I would multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. Finally, I would subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34. Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, my strategy is to follow the order of operations: parentheses, multiplication and division, and then addition and subtraction. 

First, I look for any parentheses in the equation. I see that there are parentheses around the expression (2 + 5). 

Inside the parentheses, I see the operation +, which means addition. So, I add 2 and 5 together, which equals 7.

Now I can replace the expression (2 + 5) with 7 in the original equation: 

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I look for any multiplication or division in the equation. I see that there are multiplication operations *.

So, I multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. I also multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6.

Now I can replace the multiplication operations with their results in the equation: 

28 + 12 - 6

Finally, I look for any addition or subtraction in the equation. I see that there is an addition operation + and a subtraction operation -.

So, I add 28 and 12, which equals 40. Then, I subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34."
