gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will follow the order of operations rule. First, I will perform any calculations inside parentheses. In this case, there are no parentheses. 
Next, I will multiply and divide from left to right. So, I will multiply 4 by the sum of 2 and 5 which is 7. This gives me 4 * 7 which equals 28.
Then, I will perform any addition and subtraction from left to right. So, I will add 28 with 12 which is 40.
Lastly, I will subtract 2 multiplied by 3 which is 6 from 40. This gives me 40 - 6 which is 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I'll just follow the order the numbers are written. First, I solve the operation inside the parentheses. 2 + 5 equals 7. 

After that, I'll multiply 4 by the result from the previous step, which is 7. 4 * 7 equals 28. 

Then, I'll add 12 to 28. 12 + 28 equals 40. 

Next, I'll multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. 

Finally, I'll subtract 6 from 40. 40 - 6 equals 34. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Well, let me see. I'm not sure, but I think I should start by adding 2 and 5 first, because the numbers in the brackets always come before anything else. That gives me 7. Then, I need to multiply 4 by 7, which is 28. Next, I add 12 to 28, which is 40. Finally, I subtract 2 times 3 from 40. Since multiplication comes before subtraction, I multiply first and get 6. Then, I subtract 6 from 40. So the final answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we need to add 2 and 5, which equals 7. Then we multiply that by 4, which gives us 28. 
Next, we multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. 
Now, we subtract 6 from 28, which gives us 22. 
Finally, we add 12 to 22, which gives us 34. 

Therefore, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations tells me that I should first do any calculations inside parentheses, but there are no parentheses in this problem. Next, I should do any multiplication or division from left to right. In this case, I have the multiplication 4*3, so I should do that first. 4*3 equals 12. Finally, I should do any addition or subtraction from left to right. In this case, I have the addition 12 + 2. 12 + 2 equals 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will use the order of operations. The first step is to multiply 4 by 3, which equals 12. Then I will add 2 to 12, which equals 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this. Well, I know that I need to do the multiplication before I do the addition. So, first I'll multiply 4 and 3 together to get 12. Then, I'll add 2 to that. So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we can use the order of operations. First, we do the multiplication 4*3 which equals 12. Then, we add 2 to the result of 12. So the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations tells me that I should multiply before adding. So, I first need to multiply 2 and 4, which gives me 8. Then, I can add 5 to 8. The answer is 13.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will use the order of operations. The ""M"" in PEMDAS stands for multiplication. So, I will multiply 2 and 4 first. 2 multiplied by 4 is equal to 8. 
Then, I will do the addition. 5 plus 8 is equal to 13.
Therefore, the answer is 13.","GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this. Well, I know that I need to do the multiplication before the addition. So, I'll start by multiplying 2 times 4, which is 8. Then, I'll add 5 to 8. That makes 13. So, the answer is 13.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we can work from left to right. First, we add 5 and 2, which equals 7. Then, we multiply 7 by 4, which equals 28. 
Therefore, the answer is 28."
