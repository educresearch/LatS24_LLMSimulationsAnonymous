      <td>GPT Response: First, I do the operations inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5. Then I do 4 times the result, which is 28. Then I do 2 times 3, which is 6. Then I add all the numbers together: 28 + 12 - 6. <br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I do what's in the parentheses: 2 + 5 is 7.<br>Then, I do the multiplication: 4 times 7 is 28, and 2 times 3 is 6.<br>After that, I just do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 is 40, and 40 - 6 is 34.<br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I will add inside the parentheses: 4*(7) + 12 - 2*3. Then, I will do the multiplication in order from left to right: 28 + 12 - 6. Finally, I will do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 40 - 6. The answer is 34.</td>
