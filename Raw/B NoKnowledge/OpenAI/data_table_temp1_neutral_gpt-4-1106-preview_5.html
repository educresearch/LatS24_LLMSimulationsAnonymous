      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think this is like a puzzle! We have to do things in a special order, just like when you do stuff in games. My friend said you have to do the stuff inside the brackets first. So let's see... <br><br>First, I'll do the addition inside the brackets. So, 2 plus 5 is 7. <br><br>Now the problem looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, I think you do the times—multiplication things. So, 4 times 7 is 28, and 2 times 3 is 6. <br><br>Now it's like this: 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Then, I do the adding and subtracting from the left to the right. So, 28 plus 12 is 40, and then take away 6 from 40, which is 34.<br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so since I'm in grade 6 and haven't learned about the order of operations yet, I might just do the operations from left to right. But, let me try to figure this out step by step, and maybe there is a smarter way to do it:<br><br>First, I see there are parentheses in the problem: (2+5). I think I should calculate what's inside them first.<br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now the expression looks like this:<br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I see some multiplication signs, and I think those are important. Multiplication probably comes before addition and subtraction.<br>So, 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6<br><br>Replacing that in the expression, we get:<br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Now I just add and subtract from left to right.<br>28 + 12 = 40<br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So, I think, even without knowing PEMDAS, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I might just do the calculations from left to right as I read them, like this:<br><br>First I see 4 and a multiplication sign and then there's a parentheses with 2+5. But I'm not sure how to deal with those. Maybe I just add what's inside first because they kind of make a little room for 2 and 5 to be together, like they're having a party and don't want to be bothered. So:<br><br>2 + 5 equals 7.<br><br>The problem now looks like this:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>I guess I keep going from left to right.<br><br>So now I multiply 4 times 7:<br><br>4 * 7 equals 28.<br><br>Now my math problem looks like this:<br><br>28 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Keep going from left to right...<br><br>28 + 12 equals 40.<br><br>The problem is now:<br><br>40 - 2 * 3<br><br>Subtract 2 from 40:<br><br>40 - 2 equals 38.<br><br>Finally, you multiply by 3:<br><br>38 * 3 is... oh, uh, I don't know really big numbers multiplication yet, but I can add 38 three times like this:<br><br>38 + 38 + 38 - I can do this part! It's like stacking blocks and then counting them all. So that would be... 76 and then 114!<br><br>So, if I did it from left to right without knowing any special maths rules, I'd probably say:<br><br>The answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: So, first I think we should add the numbers in the parentheses because it's like they're in a little bubble. So that's 2 + 5 which is 7. Then we have 4 times that bubble, so 4 * 7, that's like 4 plus 4 plus 4 plus 4 plus 4 plus 4 plus 4, which is 28.<br><br>Then we also add 12, so 28 plus 12 is 40.<br><br>And there's this other part where we multiply 2 times 3, which makes 6.<br><br>So we had 40, and then we take away 6 since we subtract at the end. So what's 40 minus 6? That’s like if you have 40 candies and eat 6, you have 34 candies left.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: So, I just learned this cool rule that helps us figure out math problems like this. It's called the order of operations, and it helps us know what to do first. My teacher told us to remember it like this: PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>For the problem 4*3+2, here's what I would do:<br><br>1. Look for Parentheses; there are none here.<br>2. Look for Exponents; none here either.<br>3. Now, do the Multiplication or Division (from left to right).

I just add 12 and 2 together.<br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>So, after doing the multiplication first and then the addition, the answer is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I think you just do it in the order it's written, so first you do 4 times 3, which is 12, and then you add 2. So it would be like 12 plus 2, which is 14. The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: You just have to do the multiplication first and then add the number after that. So, you do 4 times 3, which is 12, and then you add 2. If you add 12 and 2, you get 14. <br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: So, I just learned this cool rule that helps solve math problems like this one! It is called "PEMDAS," and it stands for:<br><br>P - Parentheses first<br>E - Exponents (like squares and square roots, etc.)<br>MD - Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)<br>AS - Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)<br><br>So looking at the problem 5 + 2 * 4, we don't have any parentheses or exponents to worry about. According to PEMDAS, we do multiplication before addition. So, we should multiply 2 and 4 first.<br><br>2 times 4 is 8.<br><br>Now we replace the 2 * 4 in the problem with 8, so it becomes:<br><br>5 + 8.<br><br>Then we just add 5 and 8 together.<br><br>5 plus 8 equals 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I think you just do it from left to right, like when you read! So first you do 5 plus 2 which is 7, and then you multiply that by 4. So 7 times 4 is 28. <br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: When solving math problems, there's a really cool trick called "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally," or PEMDAS, which tells you which order to do things. <br><br>P stands for Parentheses: do what’s inside them first.<br>E is for Exponents: do those next, like if you have numbers with a square or cube.<br>M and D are next, they stand for Multiply and Divide, and you do these from left to right.<br>Lastly, A and S, they stand for Add and Subtract, also done from left to right.<br><br>So for 5+2*4, we don't have parentheses or exponents, but we do have multiplication and addition.<br><br>The rule says we should do multiplication before we add. So let's do 2 times 4 first. 2 times 4 equals 8.<br><br>Then we add that to 5. So we go 5 plus 8 which equals 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think I remember my teacher talking about this. She said that we need to do the multiplication part before we add or subtract things. So, I should multiply 3 times 2 first, and then add the 5 afterwards. Okay, here's what I'd do:<br><br>First, I multiply 3 by 2, which gives me 6.<br><br>Then I add that to 5, so 5 plus 6 equals 11.<br><br>So if I do it that way, the answer should be 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: When solving the problem 5 + 3 * 2, even as an elementary school student, I know that multiplication is something like repeated addition.
