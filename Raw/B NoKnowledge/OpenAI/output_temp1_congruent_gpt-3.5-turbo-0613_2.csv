systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. First, we do the calculations inside the parentheses. 2 + 5 equals 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. Next, we have addition and subtraction. We add 28 and 12 to get 40. Lastly, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3 from 40. 2 multiplied by 3 equals 6, so we subtract 6 from 40. 

The answer is 34."
