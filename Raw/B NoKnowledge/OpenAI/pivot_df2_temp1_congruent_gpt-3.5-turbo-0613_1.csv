gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. This means we need to do the calculations inside parentheses first. Inside the parentheses, we add 2 and 5, which equals 7. We can rewrite the expression as 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, we need to multiply. We multiply 4 and 7, which gives us 28. We rewrite the expression as 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, we need to do the multiplication. We multiply 2 and 3, which gives us 6. We rewrite the expression as 28 + 12 - 6.

Finally, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right. We add 28 and 12, which gives us 40. Then we subtract 6 from 40, which gives us 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I'll just start by adding the numbers inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7. 
Then, I'll multiply this result by 4: 4 * 7 = 28. 
Next, I'll subtract 2 multiplied by 3: 2 * 3 = 6. 12 - 6 = 6. 
Lastly, I'll add the results of the previous calculations: 28 + 6 = 34. 
So, the final answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, you need to solve the operations inside the parentheses. 2 + 5 equals 7.
Next, you need to multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28.
Then, you need to subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which equals 6.
Finally, you need to add 28 and 12, which equals 40.
So, the answer is 40.","GPT Response: First, I need to do the calculation inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5 = 7.

Next, I multiply 4 by the result inside the parentheses, so 4 * 7 = 28.

Then, I add 12 to the previous result, which is 28 + 12 = 40.

After that, I multiply 2 by 3, which is 2 * 3 = 6.

Lastly, I subtract the result of the multiplication from the previous result, so 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34."

So, the answer is 11.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to follow the order of operations. I'll start by multiplying 3 and 2, getting 6. Then, I'll add 5 to that result. So, the answer is 11.","GPT Response: I would solve this problem by starting with the numbers that are next to each other first. So, I would multiply 3 and 2 which gives me 6. Then, I would add 5 to that. The answer is 11.","GPT Response: First, we need to add 5 and 3 together, which gives us 8. Then, we multiply 8 by 2, which gives us 16. 
So the answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to use the order of operations. The order of operations tells us to perform multiplication before addition. 

Start by multiplying 7 and 2, which gives us 14. Then, multiply 8 and 5, which gives us 40. 

Finally, add 14 and 40 together to get the final answer. 

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will do the operations from left to right without considering any order of operations or parentheses. 

So, 7*2 = 14 and 8*5 = 40. 

Then, I will add these two results: 14 + 40 = 54. 

Therefore, the answer is 54.","GPT Response: Um, well, when you have a math problem like this with multiplication and addition, you're supposed to do the multiplication first and then the addition. So, let's do the multiplication first. We have 7 times 2 which is 14, and 8 times 5 which is 40. Then, we add those two answers together. 14 plus 40 is 54. So, um, the answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, you need to multiply 7 by 2 which is equal to 14. Then you need to multiply 8 by 5 which is equal to 40.
