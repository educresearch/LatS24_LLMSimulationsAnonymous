      <td>GPT Response: Umm, I think I just need to do the math from left to right. So, first I'll do 4 * (2+5), which is 28. Then I'll add 12 to get 40. After that I'll subtract 2 * 3, which is 6. So the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I will add 2 and 5 which equals 7. Then, I will multiply 4 by 7, giving me 28. After that, I will multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. Lastly, I will subtract 6 from 28 which gives me 22. <br><br>The answer is 22.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, let's do the operations inside the parentheses. So, 2+5 is 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. After that, we do 2 times 3, which is 6. Next, we add 12 and 28 to get 40. Finally, we subtract 6 from 40 to get the final answer.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I just do the operations from left to right without following any rules. So I do 4 times 7, which is 28. Then I add 12, which is 40. Then I subtract 2 times 3, which is 6. So the answer is 34. <br>The answer is 34.</td>
