      <td>GPT Response: I don't know how to solve this problem.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I will do the operations inside the parentheses: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. Then, I will multiply first 4 * 7 to get 28, and then 2 * 3 to get 6. Finally, I will add and subtract in order from left to right: 28 + 12 - 6. The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Umm, I don't know much about these orders thing, but I think I should just do the multiplying first and then do the adding and subtracting. So, 4 * (2+5) is 28, and 2 * 3 is 6. Then I add 28 and 12 to get 40, and then I subtract 6. So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I just do the math from left to right. So, 4 times 7 is 28. Then, I add 12 to get 40. After that, I subtract 2 times 3 which is 6. So, the answer is 40 minus 6 which is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
