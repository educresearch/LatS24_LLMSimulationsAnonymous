gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us which calculations to do first. First, I start with any calculations inside parentheses, but there are no parentheses in this problem. Then, I move on to exponents, but there are no exponents in this problem either. Next, I do multiplication and division from left to right. Since there is multiplication in this problem, I need to multiply 2 and 4. 2 times 4 equals 8. Finally, I do addition and subtraction from left to right. Since there is addition, I need to add 5 and 8. 5 plus 8 equals 13. 

So, the answer is 13."

gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to use the order of operations (PEMDAS). The P stands for parentheses, which means we need to solve anything inside parentheses first.

Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5, which equals 7. 

Now we can simplify the expression: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, we need to multiply and divide from left to right. We start with 4 * 7, which equals 28.

Now our expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, we multiply 2 * 3, which equals 6. 

Now our expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 6.

Finally, we add and subtract from left to right. 

First, we add 28 + 12, which equals 40. 

Now our expression becomes: 40 - 6.

Finally, we subtract 40 - 6, which equals 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: According to the given persona, the student does not know anything about the order of operations. Therefore, they would simply solve the problem from left to right, without considering any rules about which operations to perform first.
