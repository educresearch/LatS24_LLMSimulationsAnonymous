gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Oh boy, okay, I remember my teacher saying something about doing things in a special order when there are parentheses and stuff. So, I think we should do the part in the parentheses first!

So we have 2 + 5 inside the parentheses. That's easy; 2 plus 5 is 7.

Now it looks like 4 times that 7, plus 12, minus 2 times 3. My teacher said after parentheses we do multiplication or division before we do addition or subtraction.

So first, 4 times 7, that's 28. 

And 2 times 3 is 6.

So now we have 28, plus 12, minus 6. Adding 28 and 12 first, that gets us to 40. Lastly, we subtract the 6. 

So, 40 minus 6 is 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: I'm not sure what PEMDAS is, but I think I'm supposed to do something with the parentheses first. So, I'll start by adding the numbers inside the parentheses:

2 + 5 = 7

Now, I have to do the multiplication next I think because that seems important when there are parentheses:

4 * 7 = 28

Next, I have the rest of the problem left:

28 + 12 - 2*3

I'll do the multiplication next because my teacher said that comes before addition and subtraction:

2 * 3 = 6

Now I'm left with:

28 + 12 - 6

I think I just go from left to right now, so I'll add 28 and 12:

28 + 12 = 40

Finally, I'll subtract 6 from 40:

40 - 6 = 34

So, if I did everything right, the answer should be:

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Oh, so I think we just do the math like from left to right, like reading a book! So first we do 4 times something plus 12 minus something else.

First, I see 4 times and there's a 2 plus 5 in the brackets. I'm not sure what the brackets mean, but let's just add 2 plus 5 and get 7 because that's how you add numbers. So we have 4 times 7 now.

4 times 7 is... oh, I know this from my times table! It's 28. So now we have 28 plus 12 minus 2 times 3.

Next, we add 28 plus 12, which is... umm, 40! So, now it looks like 40 minus 2 times 3.

Now, 2 times 3 is like having 2 cookies and you get 3 times more, so that's 2 plus 2 plus 2 which is 6.

Last, we take 40 minus 6, and that's... let's count back from 40! It's 34!

So I think the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I know that when there are parentheses, I should do that math first. So I add 2 plus 5, which is 7.

Next, since there's multiplication next to the parentheses, I should do that. So, 4 times 7 equals 28.

Then, I just do what's left from left to right. I add 28 and 12 together to get 40. After that, I have to subtract something but I also see there's another multiplication, so I do that first! 

2 times 3 equals 6. So now I just take 40 and subtract 6.

40 minus 6 equals 34.

So, the answer is 34."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: If I don't know about the order of operations, I might solve the problem like this:

I see numbers and symbols, so I might just start from left to right like I read a book.

First, I would multiply 4 times 3 because that's the first thing I see, which gives me 12.

Then, I'll add the 2 to that result, because that's the next thing in the problem.

So, 12 plus 2 equals 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve the math problem 4*3 + 2, I can first do the multiplication part because I learned that multiplication comes before addition. So I will multiply 4 and 3 together first:

4 * 3 = 12

Now I have the number 12 and I just need to add 2 to it:

12 + 2 = 14

So the final answer is 14. The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Okay! So I think we just go from left to right like we read a book. First, I will multiply 4 and 3 because that's the first thing we see, so that's 12. Then we add the 2 at the end. So 12 plus 2 equals 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Well, I think we just do the math one by one from left to right. So first we do 4 times 3 which is 12, and then we add 2 to that, so it's like:

4*3 is 12
12 + 2 is 14

So, the answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: If I don't know about the order of operations, I might solve the problem from left to right, just like I read a sentence. So here goes:

First, I would add 5 and 2 to get 7.
Then, I would take that 7 and multiply it by 4.

So the math would look like this: 7 * 4, which equals 28.

But since I'm supposed to do multiplication before addition, the real way to do it would be to first multiply 2 by 4 to get 8, and then add that to 5 to get 13. However, because I don't know about order of operations yet, I might not do it that way.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: When you have a math problem with different operations like addition and multiplication, you have to do them in a certain order, because if you don't, you could end up with the wrong answer. 

So, for 5 + 2*4, you need to do the multiplication before you do the addition. That's because multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations. 

First, you multiply 2 by 4, which gives you 8. 

Then, you add that to 5. So you add 5 plus 8.

5 + 8 = 13

So, the answer is 13.","GPT Response: Okay! So I think we just go from left to right like when we read a book. So first, I'll add 5 plus 2 which is 7. Then I take that 7 and multiply it by 4 because that's the next number. So 7 times 4 is 28! That was fun. The answer is 28.","GPT Response: When you have multiplication and addition, my teacher says you should do the multiplication first. So I'll do 2 times 4 first, because that's like 2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 2, which is 8. Then, I'll add the 5. So it's like 5 plus 8 which is 13. 

The answer is 13."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: If I don't know about the order of operations, I might solve the problem from left to right, just like I read a sentence. So here goes:

First, I would add 5 and 3 to get 8.
Then, I would take that 8 and multiply it by 2.

So the math would look like this: 8 * 2, which equals 16.

But since I'm supposed to do multiplication before addition, the real way to do it would be to first multiply 3 by 2 to get 6, and then add that to 5. And that way, the answer is 11.

So even though I calculated it wrong at first, the correct answer is: The answer is 11.","GPT Response: When you have a math problem with different operations like multiplication and addition, you have to do them in a certain order, because if you don't, you could end up with the wrong answer. 

So, for 5 + 3*2, you need to do the multiplication before you do the addition. That's because multiplication is like saying you have a certain number of groups of something, and addition is like putting things together. You need to know how much you have in those groups first before you can add them to something else.

First, do the multiplication:
3 * 2 = 6

Then, you take that result and add it to 5:
5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Okay! So I think you just go from left to right like reading a book. First you do the 5 plus 3, which is 8, and then you multiply it by 2. So that's 8 times 2, which is 16. 

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Oh, I think I learned this. My teacher told me that when we see numbers and signs like plus and times, we have to do the times part before we do the plus part. It's like a rule that helps us know which to do first.

So first I need to do 3 times 2. That's like 3 plus 3, which is 6.

Then I take that answer, 6, and add it to the 5 from the start. So it's 5 plus 6, which is 11.

The answer is 11."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Oh! I remember my teacher talking about something like ""Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally,"" which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). That's how we're supposed to do the math problems in the right order!

So for this problem, 7 times 2 plus 8 times 5, there aren't any parentheses or exponents, but there is multiplication and addition. I should do the multiplication parts first and then add the results.

First, I do the multiplication:
7 times 2 is 14
And 8 times 5 is 40

So now I replace those in the problem:
14 + 40

Now, I just have to add those together:
14 plus 40 is 54

So the final answer is, The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Okay, I'm going to solve this problem step by step. First, I'll do the multiplication parts, because I think we're supposed to do those before addition.

So, I will multiply 7 by 2, which gives me 14. Then, I will multiply 8 by 5, which gives me 40.

Now I have the results of the multiplication, it's time to add them together. So I take 14 and add it to 40.
14 + 40 = 54.

So, the final answer is 54.","GPT Response: Oh, I'm not really sure how to do this because we haven't learned about the rules for the order of doing math problems yet. But I think maybe we can just do the math from left to right like I read words!

So first I would do 7 times 2, which is 14. Then I would add that to the next number, 8, which makes 22. Then I would take that and multiply by 5 because that's next, right? So 22 times 5 is 110.

So I'm thinking the answer is 110!","GPT Response: First I'm going to multiply 7 by 2, which is 14. Then I'll multiply 8 by 5, which is 40. After that, I'm going to add the two answers together. So, 14 plus 40 equals 54!

The answer is 54."
