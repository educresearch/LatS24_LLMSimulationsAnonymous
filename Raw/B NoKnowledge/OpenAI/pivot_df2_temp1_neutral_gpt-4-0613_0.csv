gpt-4-0613,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, I'll add 2 and 5 which is 7. Then, I'll multiply that by 4, which is 28. 

Next, I'll subtract 2 and 3 which is -1. And then I'll multiply that by 2, which is -2.

After that, I'll add 28 and 12 together to get 40. Then, I'll subtract -2 from that and get 42. 

The answer is 42.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who does not know about the PEMDAS rule:

First step: multiply 4 by 2, which gives 8. 
Next step: add 5 to 8, which results in 13. 
Then, add 12 to 13, which results in 25.
Afterwards, subtract 2 from 25, which gives 23.
The last step will be to multiply 3 by 2, which equals 6. 

Then, subtract the result from the previous operations, which is 23 minus 6. That leaves us with 17.

The answer is 17.","GPT Response: Okay, so first I'm gonna go ahead and add the 2+5 together because that's the first thing I see. So, that gives us 7. Then, I multiply 4 with 7, that gives us 28. Then, I'm gonna add that to 12 and I'll get 40. After that, I'm just gonna subtract 2 from 40 and then multiply that by 3. This gives me 114. 

The answer is 114.","GPT Response: First, let's add the numbers in the parentheses, so 2 + 5 is 7. The problem now looks like this: 4*7+12-2*3.

Next, let's do the multiplication: so 4 times 7 is 28, and 2 times 3 is 6. Now our problem is: 28+12-6. 

Then, add 28 and 12 to get 40. The problem becomes 40-6.

Finally, subtract 6 from 40 which equals 34. 

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would calculate from left to right. So, I would first multiply 4 by 3, which gives me 12. Then, I would add 2 to 12, resulting in 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Since I don't know anything about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would just solve the math problem from left to right. 

First, I multiply 4 and 3 which equals 12. 

Then I add the 2 to the 12 which equals 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Since I am a student in elementary school and I do not know about the order of operations, I will solve the math problem from left to right, just as I read a sentence. 

First, I multiply 4 and 3 to get 12, then I add 2. This gives me a total of 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, I will add the numbers 3 and 2 together because that seems easy. I get 5. Then, I will multiply 4 with the result because that's the next step in the question. 4 times 5 is 20. So, the answer is 20."
gpt-4-0613,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would calculate from left to right. So, I would first add 5+2 which equals 7, then multiply 7*4 which equals 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Since I don't know anything about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would just solve this problem from left to right. 

First, I would add 5 and 2 to get 7. 

Then I multiply that 7 with 4 to get 28. 

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, I will do the addition part because it is the first operation that comes up in the problem which is 5+2 which equals 7. Then I will multiply 7 with 4 which equals 28. 

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Well, I haven't learned about order of operations yet, but I see that I can add and multiply. So, I'll just do what I see from left to right. 
First, I add 5 + 2 together, which equals 7. Then, I multiply 7 times 4, which equals 28. So, my answer will be that.

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Since I don't know anything about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would just solve the math problem from left to right. 

First, I would add 5 + 3 which equals 8. Then I multiply that answer, 8, by 2 which equals 16.

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Since I am a student in elementary school and I do not know about the order of operations, I will just solve the problem from left to right. 

First, I will add 5 + 3, which is 8. Then I will multiply this sum by 2.

8 * 2 = 16.

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Well, I haven't learned about order of operations yet, but I see that I can add and multiply. So, I'll just do what I see from left to right.

gpt-4-0613,1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I'd just solve the math problem from left to right. 

First, I'll do 7 * 2, which is 14. Then I'll add 8 to 14, which gives me 22. Lastly, I'll do 22 * 5, which is 110.

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: First, I will multiply 7 by 2, and I got 14. Then, I will multiply 8 by 5, and I got 40. Lastly, I will add 14 and 40 together, and I got 54.  

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: As a student not familiar with the order of operations, I would just solve the problem from left to right. First, I'd multiply 7 by 2, getting 14. Then I'd add 8 to that result, getting 22. And finally, I'd multiply 22 by 5, getting 110. So, in my understanding, the answer would be 110.

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: In elementary school, I was taught to solve math problems from left to right. Just like reading a book. So, I will do the multiplication and addition in the order it is written in.

First, I will multiply 7 by 2. This equals 14.
Then, I add 14 and 8 together. This equals 22.
Finally, I multiply 22 by 5. This equals 110.
