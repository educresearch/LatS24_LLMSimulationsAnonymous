gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Okay, since I'm in grade 6 and just learning about the order of operations, I might not know the exact rules like PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). But I might have heard from my teacher or classmates that we should do some parts of a math problem before others!

So, I think I should do the math inside the parentheses first because it seems like a separate little problem. Inside the parentheses, I have 2 + 5, so I'll add those together.

2 + 5 = 7

Now, I replace the parentheses with the result:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Now, I think I should deal with the multiplication next, because I remember hearing that multiplication comes before addition and subtraction.

So I’ll do 4 times 7, and 2 times 3.

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Then I’ll put those into the problem:

28 + 12 - 6

Next, I think I should just go from left to right, doing addition and then subtraction.

So, 28 plus 12 is:

28 + 12 = 40

Finally, I need to subtract 6 from 40 to get the final answer:

40 - 6 = 34

So, putting it all together, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: Alright, since I don't know anything about PEMDAS, I'll try to solve the problem step by step, in the order I see the numbers and signs:

First, I see a 4 and a multiplication sign before the parentheses, so I'll multiply 4 by what's inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5. But, before I can multiply, I need to add those numbers together, so:

2 + 5 equals 7.

Now, I take that 7 and multiply it by 4 since it was outside the parentheses:

4 * 7 equals 28.

Now I continue down the line. And also, I see there is a plus 12 next, so let's add that:

28 + 12 equals 40.

Then there's a minus sign and 2 times 3. Since multiplication comes before subtraction in my vague sense of math rules, I will first multiply 2 by 3:

2 * 3 equals 6.

Then, I subtract that 6 from 40:

40 - 6 equals 34.

So, without knowing the formal order of operations, I still arrived at an answer, which is:
The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Since I don't know about order of operations yet, I might just solve this problem from left to right like reading a book. So here's how I would do it:

First, I start with 4 and then I see a times sign (*), so I multiply 4 with the next number which is 2. That gives me 8.

Then I take that 8 and add the 5 next to it because addition (+) is the next thing I see. So 8 plus 5 is 13.

Next, I see there is another addition sign (+), so I add 12 to 13, which gives me 25.

Now, I have to subtract 2 because that’s what comes after the 12, so 25 minus 2 is 23.

Finally, the last thing I see is another times sign (*), so I multiply 23 by 3. This gives me 69.

I might not understand that we have to do multiplication before addition and subtraction yet, or that we have to add numbers inside the parentheses (2 + 5) before multiplying, so I didn’t do those parts right.

So, the answer is 69.","GPT Response: So, my teacher told us that when we do math problems, we have to do some things before others. It's like a game where some rules tell us which steps to take first. She mentioned something like ""Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally"" which helps us to remember the order.

That stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). So in this problem, I see there are parentheses, multiplication, addition, and subtraction!

First, I should do what's in the parentheses: (2 + 5), which is 7.

Now the problem looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I do the multiplication parts because that comes before addition and subtraction.
So I multiply 4 times 7 to get 28, and multiply 2 times 3 to get 6.

Now it looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

Then I just add and subtract from left to right. So first I add 28 and 12 to get 40.

Now it looks like: 40 - 6

And lastly, I subtract 6 from 40, which is 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Oh, I think I just do the operations from left to right, like reading a book! So first I'll do the multiplication because that's the first thing I see. That's 4 times 3, which is 12. Then I'll just add 2 to that. So 12 plus 2 is 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Okay, since I haven't learned about the order of operations yet, I might think that I should just calculate this going from left to right because that's how we read.

First, I would multiply 4 by 3, because multiplication is just like adding something several times. So that's like 4 + 4 + 4, which is 12.

Then, I'll take that 12 and add 2 to it because the problem says to add 2 after the multiplication. So, 12 + 2 is 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I might just solve it from left to right like I read a book!
So I would do 4 times 3 first, which is 12, and then add 2 to that, which gives me 14.
The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Well, since I'm in elementary school and I haven't learned the rules for the order of operations yet, I might think that I just need to do the math from left to right, like reading a book. 

So first, I would do 4 times 3 which is 12. Then, I would add 2 to that. 

So, 12 plus 2 equals 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Oh, I think I remember my teacher talking about something with letters, like PEMDAS, which has to do with the order I should do math problems. But I don't know exactly what it means because we haven't learned it yet. My guess is that maybe I should do the multiplication part first because I saw my older sibling do that once. So if I try that, it looks like this:

First, I do 2 times 4, which is 8.
Then I add 5 to that, so 5 plus 8.

5 + 8 equals 13. And also, I'll probably learn more about this in class soon, but for now, I'm just guessing this is how you do it. 

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: Since I'm just learning, I'd think I should solve it from left to right, like reading a book. So, I would first add 5 plus 2 to get 7 and then multiply 7 by 4 to get 28. But I remember my teacher mentioning that there's a special order to follow in math problems, where multiplication comes before addition.

I might have to multiply 2 and 4 first, because that's what the teacher said, ""multiplication before addition."" So, I think it should be like this:

First do the multiplication:
2 * 4 = 8

Then add the 5:
5 + 8 = 13

So, after remembering the right order, the answer is 13.","GPT Response: Oh, so we have to figure out what 5 plus 2 times 4 equals. I think we just do it from left to right like reading a book! So first, we add 5 and 2 together to get 7, and then we multiply 7 by 4, which gives us 28. 

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Well, in my class, we just learned that when we see problems like this, we do the multiplication part first before we do the addition. So, I have to multiply 2 times 4 first. That's like adding 2 four times. So 2 plus 2 is 4, and then another 2 makes 6, and then one more 2 makes 8. I've got 8 from the multiplication part now.

After that, I take that answer, which is 8, and then I add the 5 to it. So if I have 5, and then I add 8 more, let's count together: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. So the final answer is 13!

The answer is 13."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Oh, I think I remember my teacher talking about this. We have to do the multiplication part before we do the addition part. So first, I have to multiply 3 by 2, which gives me 6. Then, I add the 5 to that. So 5 plus 6 is 11. 

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Since I'm just learning, I'd think I should solve it from left to right, like reading a book. So, I would first add 5 + 3 and get 8. Then I would multiply that by 2 to get 16.

But my teacher just told me about this thing called PEMDAS or ""Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally,"" which means we do things in this order: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

There aren't any parentheses or exponents here, so I'll start with Multiplication:

3 * 2 = 6

And then I do the Addition:

5 + 6 = 11

So the final answer doing it the way my teacher said with PEMDAS is:

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Oh, so I think I just do the math from left to right, like reading a book! So first I add 5 plus 3 to get 8, and then I multiply that by 2. Let's see, 8 times 2 is 16. So, the answer is 16.","GPT Response: Well, in my class, we just learned about this! When you have a math problem with adding and multiplying, you're supposed to do the multiplying part first and then the adding. So, for 5 + 3*2, you do 3 times 2 first, which is 6. After that, you add the 5 to the 6, which makes 11. So, the answer to the math problem is...

The answer is 11."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Oh, I'm just learning about this in math class! Okay, so I remember my teacher saying something about doing multiplication before addition. So first, I should multiply the numbers before I add anything.

Let's see, I'll do the multiplication parts first:
7 times 2 equals 14, and 8 times 5 equals 40.

Now, I'll add those results together:
14 plus 40 equals 54.

So, The answer is 54.","GPT Response: So, even though I don't know about the order of operations yet, I think I can still try to figure this out step by step!

First, I'll multiply 7 by 2, which gives me 14.

Then, I'll multiply 8 by 5, which gives me 40.

Now, I need to add those two results together: 14 + 40.

When I add them up, I get 54.

So, I think the answer is 54. 

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Well, since I don't know the rules for what order to do things, I might just work from left to right like I read a book! 

7 times 2 is 14, and then 8 times 5 is 40. If I add those together, 14 plus 40, that gives me 54. So I think the answer is 54! 

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Okay, so I'm just an elementary school kid! But I know that if I see multiplication and addition, I should do the multiplication parts first before I add things up. So, let's multiply first!

7 times 2 is 14, because 7 plus 7 is 14. 

And 8 times 5 is 40, because 5 plus 5 is 10 and we need to do that 8 times, so that's like doing 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 10, which is 40.

Now we just add those two together:

14 (that's from 7 times 2) plus
40 (that's from 8 times 5)

14 + 40 is 54!

The answer is 54."
