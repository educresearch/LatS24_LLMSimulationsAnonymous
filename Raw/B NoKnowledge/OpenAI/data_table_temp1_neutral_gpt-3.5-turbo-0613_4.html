      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, first, we need to perform the operations inside the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5 which equals 7. <br>Then, we multiply 4 by 7, which gives us 28. <br>Next, we add 12 to 28, which gives us 40. <br>Finally, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which gives us 6. <br>Therefore, the answer is 40 - 6 = 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will first calculate the value inside the parentheses, which is 2+5. That gives me a result of 7. Then, I will multiply 4 by 7, which is 28. Next, I will add 12 to 28, which gives me 40. Finally, I will subtract 2 multiplied by 3 from 40, resulting in 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, this looks like a math problem! Let's try to solve it step by step. First, we see the addition symbol (+) between the numbers 5 and 2. So, we start by adding 5 and 2, which gives us 7. Then, we have a multiplication symbol (*) between 2 and 4. We know that multiplication means we have to do that operation next. So, 2 multiplied by 4 is 8. Finally, we put the two results together. The answer is 7 + 8, which gives us 15.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so first I'm going to do 7 times 2, which is 14. Then, I'm going to do 8 times 5, which is 40. Now I'm going to add those two results together. 14 plus 40 is 54. So the answer is 54.</td>
