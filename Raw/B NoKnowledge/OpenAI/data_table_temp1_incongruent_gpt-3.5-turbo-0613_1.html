      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. Starting inside the parentheses, we find that 2 + 5 equals 7. <br><br>Next, we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. <br><br>Then, we add 12 to 28, which equals 40. <br><br>Finally, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which is 6, from 40. <br><br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I can just follow the order of operations (PEMDAS). First, I need to do the addition inside the parentheses. Two plus five equals seven, so the expression becomes 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. Then, I need to do the multiplication. Four times seven equals twenty-eight, so the expression becomes 28 + 12 - 2 * 3. Finally, I can do the multiplication and subtraction. Two times three equals six, so the expression becomes 28 + 12 - 6. Adding 28 and 12 gives us forty, and then subtracting 6 gives us thirty-four. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. First, we calculate the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we have 2+5, which equals 7. So, 4 * 7 is 28. <br>Next, we calculate the multiplication operation. We have 2 * 3, which equals 6. <br>After that, we perform the addition and subtraction in order from left to right. So, we have 28 + 12 - 6. <br>Adding 28 and 12 gives us 40, and subtracting 6 from 40 gives us 34. <br>Therefore, the final answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I multiply 4 by (2+5) which is 4 * 7 = 28. Then, I add 28 to 12 which is 40. After that, I multiply 2 by 3 which is 6. Finally, I subtract 6 from 40 which is 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
