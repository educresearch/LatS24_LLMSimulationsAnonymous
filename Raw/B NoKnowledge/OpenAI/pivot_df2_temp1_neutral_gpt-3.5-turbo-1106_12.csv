gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,GPT Response: I don't know what to do with this. Can you please help me?,"GPT Response: To solve this, we need to follow the order of operations. First, we do the operations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7. Then, we do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6. Finally, we do the remaining addition and subtraction: 28 + 12 - 6 = 34. Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I'll add the numbers inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7. Then, I'll multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. After that, I'll multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. Lastly, I'll add 28, 12, and subtract 6, which equals 34. 
So, the final answer is ""The answer is 34.""","GPT Response: First, we solve what's inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 is 7. Then we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. After that, we add 12 to 28 and subtract 2 times 3. So 28 + 12 = 40, and 2 times 3 = 6. Finally, we subtract 6 from 40, which is 34. So the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Um, I don't really know about order of operations, but I think I just have to do the math from left to right. So, 4 times 3 is 12, then plus 2 is 14. So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication which is 4*3 = 12. Then we add 2 to 12 which gives us 14. 
So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: Um, I think we just do the math from left to right. So, 4 times 3 is 12. Then we add 2 to get 14. So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, you do 4 times 3, which is 12. Then you add 2 to that, and that makes 14. So the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Um, I don't really know how to do this, but I'll try. I think I just need to do the multiplication first, so 2*4 is 8. Then I can add 5 to 8. So the answer is 13.","GPT Response: First, we need to do the multiplication before the addition. So, 2 multiplied by 4 equals 8. Then we add 5 to the product of 2 and 4, which gives us 13. 

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: Um, I think we just do the math from left to right. So, 5+2 is 7, and then 7*4 is 28. So, the answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, you should do the multiplication first, before adding the 5. So, 2*4 is 8. Then, add 5 to 8, which equals 13. 

The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Um, I don't really know about order of operations, but I think I just have to do the math from left to right. So, 5 plus 3 is 8 and then times 2 is 16. So, the answer is 16.","GPT Response: First, we need to do the multiplication before the addition. So, 3 multiplied by 2 equals 6. Then we add 5 to the result of 6. So the answer is 11.","GPT Response: Um, I don't really know about that order thing, but I think you just do the operations from left to right. So, you would do 5 plus 3 first, and then times 2. 

So, 5 + 3 is 8, and then 8 times 2 is 16. 

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: First, you should do the math inside the parentheses. So, 3*2 equals 6. Then, you add 5 and 6 together. The answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Umm, I don't really know about order of operations, but I think I just do the operations from left to right. So, I'll do 7*2 first, which is 14, and then 8*5, which is 40. So... 14+40 is 54! So, the answer is 54.","GPT Response: To solve the problem, I just need to do the operations from left to right. So, first I'll do 7*2, which is 14. Then I'll do 8*5, which is 40. Finally, I'll add 14 and 40 together, which equals 54. 
So, the answer is 54.","GPT Response: Um, I think you just solve it from left to right. So, 7 times 2 is 14 and 8 times 5 is 40. Then, you add 14 and 40 together and get 54. So the answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, I'll just do the operations from left to right. So, 7*2 is 14, and 8*5 is 40. So, the answer is 14+40, which is 54. 

The answer is 54."
