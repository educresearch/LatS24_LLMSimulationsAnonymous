gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: To solve this math problem, I need to follow the order of operations. The order is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

First, I will solve what is inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7
Now, the expression becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I perform the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6
The expression is now: 28 + 12 - 6

Finally, I calculate the addition and subtraction from left to right:
28 + 12 = 40 and 40 - 6 = 34

Therefore, the final answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we start by calculating the expression inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5. This gives us 7.
Next, we multiply 4 by 7, which gives us 28.
Then, we add 12 to 28, which gives us 40.
After that, we multiply 2 by 3, which gives us 6.
Finally, we subtract 6 from 40, which gives us 34.
Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. First, we do the calculations inside the parentheses. The expression inside the parentheses is 2+5, which equals 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. 

Next, we do the calculations outside the parentheses. We subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which equals 6. 

Finally, we add 12 to 28 and subtract 6 from the result. 

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: Okay, so the problem is 4 times (2 plus 5) plus 12 minus 2 times 3. First, we do the addition inside the parentheses, which is 2 plus 5 equals 7. Then we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. Next, we do the multiplication of 2 times 3, which is 6. Then we subtract 6 from 28, which is 22. Finally, we add 12 to 22, which gives us the final answer of 34. 

So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations tells us to perform the multiplication first and then the addition.

So, the answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, I add 5 and 2, which gives me 7. Then I multiply 7 by 4, which equals 28. 
So, the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations tells us to perform the multiplication before the addition. So, we need to multiply 3 by 2 first. 

3 * 2 equals 6. 

Now, we can add 5 to 6. 

5 + 6 equals 11. 

So, the answer is 11.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will first do the multiplication. So, 3 times 2 equals 6. Then, I will add 5 to 6. So, the answer is 11.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I would first add 5 and 3 together to get 8. Then, I would multiply 8 by 2 to get the final answer.
