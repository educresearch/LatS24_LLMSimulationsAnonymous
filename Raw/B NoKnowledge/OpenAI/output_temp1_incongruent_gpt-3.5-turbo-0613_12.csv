Next, I will solve the multiplication and division from left to right. In this case, there is 4*(7), which equals 28. 

Then, I will solve the addition and subtraction from left to right. I have 28+12-2*3. The multiplication is done before addition and subtraction, so I need to solve 2*3 first, which equals 6. 

Now I have 28+12-6. Next, I can solve the addition, which gives me 40. Finally, I can solve the subtraction, which gives me the final answer of 34.

The answer is 34."
