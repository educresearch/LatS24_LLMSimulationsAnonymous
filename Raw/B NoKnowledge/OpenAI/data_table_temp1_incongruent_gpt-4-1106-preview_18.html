      <td>GPT Response: Oh, okay! So, my teacher just told us that when you solve math problems, there's a special order you're supposed to follow so that everyone gets the same answer. I think they said something about doing what's inside parentheses first. So here's what I think we should do:<br><br>1. First, I'm going to do the addition inside the parentheses (2+5), which equals 7.<br>2. So now the problem looks like 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br>3. I remember the teacher mentioning multiplication comes before addition or subtraction, so let's do that next.<br>4. Multiply 4 times 7, which is 28.<br>5. And also multiply 2 times 3, which is 6.<br>6. Now we have 28 + 12 - 6.<br>7. The teacher said addition and subtraction are the last steps and it goes from left to right, just like reading! So add 28 and 12 to get 40.<br>8. And lastly, subtract 6 from 40, which gives us 34.<br><br>So after following all those steps, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: All right! Let's figure out this math problem step by step. Even though I don't know the fancy rule name, my teacher did say that we need to do what's inside the parentheses first.<br><br>Inside the parentheses we have 2 + 5, which equals 7.<br><br>Now the problem looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I remember we need to do multiplication before adding or subtracting. So let's do the multiplication parts:<br><br>4 times 7 is 28.<br>And 2 times 3 is 6.<br><br>So now our problem is: 28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Now it's just a simple addition and subtraction. We add 28 and 12 to get 40. And then we subtract 6 from 40:<br><br>40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>So the final answer is 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I haven't learned about the order of operations yet, I might just solve it from left to right, like reading a book. Here's how I would do it:<br><br>First, I would start with the first part:<br>4 * (2+5)<br>I know I need to do the multiplication, and I know I need to add the numbers in the parentheses. So that's 4 * 7, which is 28.<br><br>Next, I would add 12 to 28 because that's the next thing in the equation:<br>28 + 12<br>That equals 40.<br><br>Then, I would subtract 2 from 40 because that's the next part:<br>40 - 2<br>That equals 38.<br><br>Lastly, I would multiply 3 by 2 because that's the final part:<br>2 * 3<br>That equals 6.<br><br>Now, I would turn back to my running total, which was 38, and subtract the 6:<br>38 - 6<br>That equals 32.<br><br>So, the way I solved it, the answer would be:<br>The answer is 32.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: When we do math with different operations like multiplication, addition, and subtraction, we have to follow certain rules for the order we do them in. My teacher says we have to do what's inside parentheses first, then do multiplication and division, and then we can do addition and subtraction after that. <br><br>Let's solve the problem step-by-step.<br><br>1. Solve inside the parentheses first: (2+5)<br>2 + 5 equals 7.<br><br>2. Now, multiply the answer from the parentheses by 4:<br>4 * 7 equals 28.<br><br>3. Now we can just do the rest from left to right, doing any multiplication or division we see before doing addition or subtraction:<br>28 + 12 equals 40.<br><br>4. Then, we see another multiplication: 2 * 3<br>2 * 3 equals 6.<br><br>5. Lastly, we subtract that from 40:<br>40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>So, after we do all of those steps, we find our final answer.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Uh, I haven't learned about order of operations yet, but I think you do the multiplication first and then the addition. So if I do 4 times 3, that gives me 12, and then I add 2 to that, which would be 14. So, I guess the answer is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, since I don't know about the order of operations yet, I would just solve it from left to right. So first I'd multiply 4 by 3, which gives me 12. Then I'd add 2 to that result:<br><br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I haven't learned about a special order for doing math stuff yet, but I think you need to do the multiplication first because that's what my older brother does. So it's like 4 times 3 which is 12 and then you add the 2 after. So, 12 plus 2 is 14. <br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Ok, so I have to do the math problem 4 * 3+2. I learned that when we have to do math with times (*) and plus (+), we have to do the times part first before we do the addition. <br><br>So first I'll do 4 times 3, which is 4 + 4 + 4, and that's 12.<br><br>After that, I have to add 2, so it's 12 + 2, and that gives me 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, since I just learned about the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS which stands for:<br><br>P - Parentheses first<br>E - Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)<br>MD - Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)<br>AS - Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)<br><br>I don't see any parentheses here, exponents, or division, so first I should do the multiplication part before addition. So I'm going to multiply 2 and 4 first.<br><br>2 * 4 = 8<br><br>Now, I'll add 5 to that result.<br><br>5 + 8 = 13<br><br>So, the answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Ok, so I have to figure out this math problem. My teacher said something about the order in which we have to do things in math problems. But I'm not quite sure, I think we're supposed to multiply before we add. <br><br>So first I'll do the multiplication part:<br>2 times 4 is 8.<br><br>Then I'll do the addition part:<br>5 plus 8.<br><br>5 plus 8 equals 13.<br><br>So, the answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think I just add all the numbers together! So, I do 5 plus 3 which is 8, and then I add 2 more and that's 10! The answer is 10.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Ok, so I'm a student in elementary school, but let me try! I think what we do is just solve it like a sentence, from left to right. So first, Iâ€™ll do the 5 plus 3 which is 8, and then I multiply that by 2. So 8 times 2 is 16.<br><br>The answer is 16.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations yet, I might just calculate from left to right like I read a book.<br><br>So first I see 7 times 2, which is 14.<br>Then I add 8, getting 14 + 8, which equals 22.<br>Finally, I multiply that by 5, getting 22 * 5, which equals 110.<br><br>So I'd probably say, "The answer is 110." But since I haven't learned PEMDAS yet, I might not realize that my answer should actually account for the correct order of operations, which is to do multiplication first and then addition.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve the math problem, we should do any multiplication before we add. That's what my teacher said, it's like a rule to follow!<br><br>So, let's multiply first:<br><br>7 times 2 is 14<br>8 times 5 is 40<br><br>Now, just add those two results together:<br><br>14 plus 40 equals 54.<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Um, I'm not really sure about any special rules, but I guess I just do it from left to right like I read a book! So I would multiply 7 by 2 first, which I think is 14. Then I would add 8, and then multiply by 5 because that's the next numbers in the line.<br><br>So, it's 7 times 2 which is 14, and then plus 8, so that makes 22, right? Then, I take the 22 and multiply it by 5. I might need to use my fingers or draw it out, but let me try. If I have 20 times 5, that's a hundred because 2 times 5 is 10 and then I add a zero to make it a hundred for 20 times 5. Then I have 2 times 5, which is 10, and I add that to the hundred, so it's 110! Wow, that's a big number!<br><br>So, the way I did it, the answer is 110.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm in elementary school and just learning, I might think I should solve this from left to right like reading a book. So, I will first multiply 7 by 2, which gives me 14. Then I see a plus sign, so I will add the next number 8, which gives me 22. Finally, I multiply 22 by 5, because that's the next operation, and that gives me 110. So I think the answer is 110.<br><br>The answer is 110.</td>
