systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Since I haven't learned about order of operations (meaning I don't know yet that multiplication gets done before addition), I might just calculate it from left to right. So I would take 5 plus 3 first, which equals 8. Then, I would take 8 times 2. That equals 16.

The answer is 16."
