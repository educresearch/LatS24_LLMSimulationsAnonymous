gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. First, we do the calculations inside the parentheses. So, 2 + 5 equals 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7, which is 28. Next, we add 12 to 28, which gives us 40. After that, we multiply 2 by 3, which gives us 6. Finally, we subtract 6 from 40. 

So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I can start by simplifying the parentheses first. Inside the parentheses, I add 2 and 5 together, which is 7. 

So now the expression is 4*(7) + 12 - 2*3. 

Next, I can multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. 

Now the expression is 28 + 12 - 2*3. 

Next, I multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. 

Now the expression is 28 + 12 - 6. 

Lastly, I can add 28 and 12, which equals 40. 

Now the expression is 40 - 6. 

Finally, I subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to work through the equation step by step. First, we do what is inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7. So now, our equation is 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. 

Next, we solve the multiplication parts of the equation. 4 * 7 equals 28, and 2 * 3 equals 6. So, now our equation is 28 + 12 - 6.

Finally, we add and subtract from left to right. 28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 6 equals 34. 

So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I will add the numbers inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.
Then, I will multiply 4 by 7: 4 * 7 = 28.
Next, I will add 12: 28 + 12 = 40.
Then, I will multiply 2 by 3: 2 * 3 = 6.
Finally, I will subtract 6 from 40: 40 - 6 = 34. 

The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. First, we do the multiplication. 4 multiplied by 3 is 12.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Hmm, this seems like a math problem. Let me try to solve it the way I know. First, I see the multiplication sign (*) between 4 and 3. So, I'll multiply them together first. 4 times 3 is 12. Then, I see a plus sign (+) between 12 and 2. So, I'll add them together. 12 plus 2 is 14. 

So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will follow the order of operations. First, I will multiply 4 times 3 which equals 12. Then, I will add 2. The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the rule of order of operations (PEMDAS). According to this rule, we need to do multiplication before addition. 
So, we start by multiplying 2 and 4, which gives us 8. 
Then, we add 5 to 8, which gives us our final answer. 
The answer is 13.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to use the order of operations, which is not something I know. I will just solve this problem from left to right.

gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to remember the order of operations. First, we need to solve any calculations inside parentheses or brackets, but we don't have any in this problem. Next, we do any calculations involving exponents or powers, but we don't have any of those here either. After that, we multiply and divide from left to right.
