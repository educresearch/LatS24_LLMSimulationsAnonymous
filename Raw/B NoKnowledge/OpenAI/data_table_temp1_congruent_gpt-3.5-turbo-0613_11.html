      <td>GPT Response: First, we need to perform the operations inside the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5, which equals 7. <br><br>Next, we need to simplify the multiplication operation. We have 4 * 7, which equals 28.<br><br>Now, let's solve the remaining operations from left to right. We have 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, we need to perform the multiplication operation. We have 2 * 3, which equals 6.<br><br>Now, we have 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Finally, we can perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right. We have 40 - 6, which equals 34.<br><br>Therefore, the final answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will follow the order of operations. First, I will solve anything in parentheses. In this case, there is (2 + 5). So, 2 + 5 equals 7.<br><br>Next, I will multiply 4 by 7. 4 * 7 equals 28.<br><br>Moving on to the next step, I will multiply 2 by 3. 2 * 3 equals 6.<br><br>Now, I will subtract 6 from 28. 28 - 6 equals 22.<br><br>Lastly, I will add 12 to 22. 12 + 22 equals 34.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, I'm not really sure how to solve this problem. But I think I should start by adding 2 and 5 because they are in parentheses. So, 2 + 5 is 7. Then, I multiply 4 by 7 because it's the next operation. That gives me 28. After that, I need to subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which is 6. So, I subtract 6 from 28 and get 22. <br><br>The answer is 22.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we start by adding 2 and 5, which equals 7. Then we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. Next, we add 12 to 28, which equals 40. After that, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which equals 6, from 40. So, the answer is 34.</td>
