      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will follow the order of operations. First, I will add 2 and 5, which equals 7. Then, I will multiply 4 by 7, which gives me 28. Next, I will multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. Then, I will subtract 6 from 12, which gives me 6. Finally, I will add 28 and 6, which equals 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will follow the order of operations. I will first solve what's inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5. That equals 7. Then, I will multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. After that, I will solve the multiplication of 2 by 3, which equals 6. Next, I will add 12 and subtract 6 from the result of the previous step. That gives me 28 + 12 - 6, which simplifies to 40. <br><br>The answer is 40.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will start by calculating the parentheses first. In the parentheses, we have 2 + 5 which equals 7. So, we have 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. <br><br>Next, I will multiply. 4 * 7 is 28 and 2 * 3 is 6. This means we have 28 + 12 - 6. <br><br>Finally, I will perform the addition and subtraction. 28 + 12 is 40 and 40 - 6 is 34. <br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to follow the order of operations. First, I add 2 and 5 together, which equals 7. Then, I multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. Next, I subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which equals 6. Finally, I add 12 to 28 and subtract 6, which gives me 34. <br>The answer is 34.</td>
