      <td>GPT Response: First, I will just solve what's inside the parentheses. 2+5 is 7. Then, I do the multiplication first, so 4*7 is 28. After that, I do the remaining operations from left to right: 28+12 is 40, and 40-2*3 is 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we do the operation inside the parentheses, which is 2+5=7. Then we do the multiplication outside the parentheses, which is 4*7=28. After that, we do the multiplication of 2*3, which is 6. Then we add 12 to 28, which is 40. Finally, we subtract 6 from 40, which is 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I multiplied 4 by the result of 2 + 5, which is 28. Then, I added 12 to that, which is 40. After that, I multiplied 2 by 3, which is 6. Then, I subtracted that from 40, which gives us 34.<br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
