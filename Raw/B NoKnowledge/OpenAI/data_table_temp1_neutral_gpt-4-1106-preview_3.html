      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm in grade 6 and haven't learned about order of operations yet, I might try to solve this math problem by simply going from left to right like I read a book. So I would do each part in the order it comes, not knowing that some operations should be done before others.<br><br>Here's how I might do it without knowing PEMDAS:<br><br>First, I see 4 times (2+5), so I'd start by adding the 2 and the 5, because that's the first thing I see inside the parentheses. 2+5 is 7.<br><br>Then I'd multiply that 7 by 4, because the next thing I see is the multiplication. 4 times 7 is 28.<br><br>Next, I'd just keep going from left to right, so I would add 12 to that 28. 28 plus 12 is 40.<br><br>Then, I'd subtract 2 from the 40 because that's next in the line. 40 minus 2 is 38.<br><br>Lastly, I multiply the 3, which is at the end, by 2. 2 times 3 is 6.<br><br>But since I'm not sure about the order, I might get confused and end up just adding this 6 to the 38 instead of going back and changing any earlier steps. So, 38 plus 6 is 44.<br><br>So, not knowing PEMDAS, I might say:<br><br>The answer is 44. (But this would be incorrect because the actual order of operations wasn't followed!).</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Even though I don't know about the order of operations yet, I can still try to work this out step by step as best as I can!<br><br>First, I see that there's a part of the equation inside parentheses: (2+5). I think I should calculate that first. So, 2 plus 5 is 7.<br><br>Now the equation looks like this: 4*7 + 12 - 2*3.<br><br>Next, I think I should do the multiplication parts before the addition and subtraction. So, 4 times 7 is 28, and 2 times 3 is 6.<br><br>Now the equation is: 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Then, I just add and subtract from left to right. So, 28 plus 12 is 40, and then 40 minus 6 is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, okay! I think you just do the math from left to right like reading a book, right?<br><br>First, there's a 4 next to a parenthesis thing with 2+5 inside. I think you do the thing in the parenthesis first, so 2+5 is 7.<br><br>Then, it's 4 times 7 because they are next to each other. That's like 4 groups of 7... and 7+7 is 14; another 7 makes 21, and then another makes 28.<br><br>Next is the plus 12. So you add 12 to 28, which I think is 40.<br><br>After that, you have to take away 2 times 3. Well, 2 times 3 is 6 because 2+2+2 is 6. <br><br>So we just subtract 6 from 40. If I took away 6 from 10, I would have 4, right? So taking away 6 from 40 leaves 34.<br><br>Putting it all together, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I know that in math problems, you usually have to do things in a special order. I think my teacher told me we have to do the stuff in parentheses first, so I will start with that!<br><br>So inside the parentheses we have:<br>2 + 5 which equals 7.<br><br>Now the equation looks like this:<br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Then, I remember that we have to do multiplication before we do addition or subtraction. I'll multiply those next!<br><br>4 * 7 equals 28,<br>and 2 * 3 equals 6.<br><br>Now the equation is:<br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Then, I just do the addition and subtraction in the order they appear from left to right.<br><br>28 + 12 equals 40,<br>and then we subtract 6 from 40, which is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, since I haven't learned about the order of operations yet, I might just do the operations from left to right as they appear. <br><br>First, I would multiply 4 by 3 which is 4 * 3 = 12.<br><br>Then I would take the 12 and add 2 to it, so 12 + 2 = 14.<br><br>So if I just follow the operations from left to right, my answer would be:<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Sure! When we have a math problem with different operations like multiplication and addition, we have to follow the order of operations to solve it correctly. The order of operations can be remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for:<br><br>P - Parentheses first<br>E - Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)<br>MD - Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)<br>AS - Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)<br><br>However, since I am a student who knows nothing about order of operations, I might try to solve this from left to right as I see it.<br><br>Let's solve the problem step by step:<br><br>Step 1: Perform the multiplication first (since even without knowing PEMDAS, I might be familiar that multiplication comes before addition in a problem like this):<br>4 times 3 equals 12.<br><br>Step 2: Now, add the result to 2:<br>12 plus 2 equals 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I just learned about addition and multiplication! I think you just do the math from left to right like reading a book. So, I'll multiply 4 and 3 first because that comes first, and that's 12. Then I add the 2, so 12 plus 2 is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think I remember my teacher saying that I should do the multiplying part before the adding part. So first I have to do 4 times 3, which is 12, and then I add 2 to that. So 12 plus 2 is 14. <br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

But for now, I'll say:<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I do know that multiplication comes before addition. So, you have to multiply 2 by 4 first. That's 2 times 4, which is 8. Then, you add the 5 to the 8.<br><br>So it's 5 + 8, which equals 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Without knowing the order of operations, I might just do the operations from left to right as I see them. So, I would add 5 + 2 first, which is 7, and then multiply that by 4. So, 7 times 4 equals 28.<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I remember my teacher telling me that when there are multiplication and addition in the same problem, I should do the multiplication part first before I add. So, I need to do 2 times 4 first, which is 8. After that, I add the 5. So, it's 5 plus 8. That's easy, 5 plus 8 is 13!<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Sure! When we have a math problem with addition and multiplication, like this one, we have to do the multiplication before we do the addition. This is a rule that everyone learns to help solve math problems in the right order called the order of operations. In this case, we need to multiply 3 and 2 together first, and then add 5 to the result of that multiplication.<br><br>So first, let's do the multiplication:<br>3 times 2 is 6.<br><br>Now, take that result and add it to 5:<br>5 plus 6 is 11.<br><br>So the final answer is 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I remember my teacher telling me that when there are different things to do in math, like adding and multiplying, I should do the multiplying first before I do the adding.
