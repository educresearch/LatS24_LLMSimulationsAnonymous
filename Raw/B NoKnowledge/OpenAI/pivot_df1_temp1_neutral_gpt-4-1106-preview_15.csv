gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Since I'm a grade 6 student and don't know about the order of operations yet, I might just do the operations from left to right. So I would add 5 + 2 first, which makes 7, and then multiply that by 4, which would give me 28.

So, I would say, ""The answer is 28."""
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Oh, I think I'm supposed to do the multiplication parts before I do addition. So first I do 7 times 2, which is 14. Then I do 8 times 5, which is 40. After that, I just need to add those two numbers together. So 14 plus 40 equals 54.

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Since I'm a grade 6 student and don't know about the order of operations yet, I might just do the math from left to right. So I would multiply 4 and 3 first, because that's the first thing I see. And 4 times 3 is 12. And then I would add 2 to 12, because that's the next thing in the question. So 12 plus 2 is 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I might think that I should solve the math problem from left to right just like I read a sentence.

So, here is what I might do:

First, I would multiply 4 by 2 because that's the first operation I see.
4 * 2 = 8

Then I would add 5 to that result:
8 + 5 = 13

Next, I would add 12 to that result:
13 + 12 = 25

And finally, I would subtract 2 times 3 from that result:
25 - 2 * 3 = 25 - 6 = 19

So I would say, the answer is 19. However, I should note that when you learn the correct order of operations, you'll find out that this is not the right way to solve the problem, but since I don't know PEMDAS, this is what makes sense to me for now."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Since I'm a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I might just do the calculation from left to right. So I would add 5 plus 3 first, which makes 8, and then multiply that by 2, which would give me 16.

So, I would say, ""The answer is 16."""
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Okay, since I haven't learned about order of operations, I might just try to solve the problem from left to right. So, I would add 5 and 2 first to get 7, and then multiply that by 4. Let me do that:

5 + 2 = 7
7 * 4 = 28

So, my answer would be 28. However, I've heard from older friends that there's a ""correct"" way to do these things where you're supposed to do the multiplication before the addition. But since I'm in grade 6 and don't know about that, I would say:

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: So, if I don't know about order of operations, I might just do the operations from left to right as they appear.

First, I multiply 7 by 2, which is 14.
Then I add 8 to that, which gives me 22.
Finally, I multiply that by 5, which gives me 110.

The answer is 110."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Okay, since I haven't learned about order of operations, I might just solve the problem from left to right. So here's what I would do:

First, I would multiply 4 by 3, because that's the first operation I see from the left. So:

4 * 3 = 12

Then, I would add 2 to my result:

12 + 2 = 14

So, if I solve it from left to right without considering any order of operations I don't know about, I would say:

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Since I'm just learning about order of operations, I'll try to follow what I think makes sense.

First, I see some parentheses which I think we're supposed to do first. So I'll start with that:

2 + 5 = 7

Next, I see multiplication and subtraction. I've heard that multiplication usually comes before subtraction, so I'll do those next:

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

So now I have:

28 + 12 - 6

Adding and subtracting from left to right seems reasonable:

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So, I think the final answer is:

The answer is 34."

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Umm, I think you just do it from left to right like reading? So first you do 5 plus 2, which is 7, and then multiply that by 4... so 7 times 4 is 28, right?

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Hmm, I think you just do the math from left to right like reading a book. So first I do 7 times 2 which is 14. Then I add 8 which is, umm, 22. Then I multiply that by 5… that would be 110, right? So the answer is 110."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Umm, I think I will just do it the way it looks. So, first I multiply 4 with 3 because that's the first things I see. 4 times 3 is 12. Now I have 12, and then I have to add 2. So 12 plus 2 equals 14. I think that's how you do it!

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Oh, I think I just do things as they come from left to right! So first, I'll do 4 times 2 plus 5, which is like 8 plus 5, so that’s 13. Then I'll add 12 to that, which is 13 plus 12, and that makes 25. And then I subtract 2 times 3 from that. Well, 2 times 3 is 6, so 25 minus 6 is 19.

The answer is 19."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Oh, I'm not really sure about any special rules for doing math problems yet, so I'll just do this the way it makes sense to me. First, I see a 5 and a 3, and I know how to add those!

5 + 3 is 8.

Then, there is the times 2 part. So I'll just multiply the 8 by 2.

8 times 2 is 16. 

So, I think the answer is 16!"
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Okay, so I'm like in elementary school and we haven't learned about any fancy operation order, but I think we just do it as we see it from left to right. So you just add 5 plus 2 which is 7, and then you multiply that by 4. That's like having seven candies, and getting 4 whole sets, which is a lot! So, 7 times 4 is 28 because 7 plus 7 is 14, and if you do that two times you get 28.

The answer is 28."

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Okay, so I'm like in elementary school and we just learned that when you add and multiply, you can do it like this:

First I see a 4 times 3, which is like 4 added 3 times. So that's 4 plus 4 plus 4. That's 12! Then, I see there's a plus 2. So I just take the 12 and add 2 more. Let's count it out: 12... 13, 14!

So, I think the answer is 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Okay, so I think we have to do something with the numbers in the problem. My teacher said we should do some things before others. I think we should start with the stuff in parentheses first. So we have to add 2+5. That's 7!

Now we have 4 times 7, plus 12, minus 2 times 3. My teacher said that multiplication is like repeated adding, so we have to do that next. 4 times 7 is like 7 plus 7 plus 7 plus 7, which is... 28!

So now the problem looks like 28 plus 12, minus 2 times 3. We still have multiplication to do. Two times 3 is like 3 plus 3, which is 6.

Finally, we have 28 plus 12, minus 6. I know that 28 plus 12 is like 28 and then 10 more which is 38, and 2 more makes 40! So now we have 40 minus 6, which is... if you take away 6 from 40, you get 34.

The answer is 34."
