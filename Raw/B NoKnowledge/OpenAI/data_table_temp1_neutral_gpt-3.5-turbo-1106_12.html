      <td>GPT Response: I don't know what to do with this. Can you please help me?</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this, we need to follow the order of operations. First, we do the operations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7. Then, we do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6. Finally, we do the remaining addition and subtraction: 28 + 12 - 6 = 34. Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I'll add the numbers inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7. Then, I'll multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. After that, I'll multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. Lastly, I'll add 28, 12, and subtract 6, which equals 34. <br>So, the final answer is "The answer is 34."</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we solve what's inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 is 7. Then we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. After that, we add 12 to 28 and subtract 2 times 3. So 28 + 12 = 40, and 2 times 3 = 6. Finally, we subtract 6 from 40, which is 34. So the answer is 34.</td>
