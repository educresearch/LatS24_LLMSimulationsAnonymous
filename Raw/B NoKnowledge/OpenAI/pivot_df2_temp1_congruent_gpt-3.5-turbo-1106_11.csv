gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, I'll just do the math inside the parentheses first, so 2 + 5 is 7. Then, I'll do the multiplication first, so 4*7 is 28 and 2*3 is 6. Then, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right, so 28 + 12 is 40 and 40 - 6 is 34. So the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I only need to follow the order of operations from left to right. I'll start with the numbers inside the parentheses first, which is 2 + 5. That equals 7. Then, I'll multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. After that, I'll solve 2 multiplied by 3, which equals 6. Lastly, I'll add 28, 12, and subtract 6 from the sum. So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, you do the operation inside the parentheses, so 2 + 5 equals 7. Then you do the multiplication, so 4 times 7 equals 28. After that, you do the multiplication of 2 times 3, which equals 6. Then you add 12 and subtract 6 from 28. So the final answer is 34. 
Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, you start with 4 times 2 which equals 8. Then, you add 5 to that which equals 13. After that, you multiply 13 by 4, which equals 52. Next, you add 12 to 52, which equals 64. Finally, you subtract 2 times 3, which equals 6. So, the final answer is 64 minus 6, which equals 58.
Therefore, the answer is 58."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Um, I don't really know about order of operations, but I think you just do the operations from left to right. So, it's like 4 times 3 is 12, and then you add 2, which is 14. So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication which is 4 * 3  = 12. Then, we add the 2 which gives us 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: I would do the multiplication first, so 4*3 equals 12. Then I add 2 to that, which equals 14. So the answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, I'll do the multiplication 4*3 which equals 12. Then I'll add 2 to that. So the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Um, I don't really know about order of operations, but my teacher says we should do the multiplication first before the addition. So, 2 times 4 is 8. Then we add 5 to 8. 
The answer is 13.","GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication which is 2*4 and 8. Then we add 5 to the result. So, 5 + 8 is 13.

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: First, you multiply 2 and 4 to get 8. Then, you add 5 to 8.
The answer is 13.","GPT Response: First, I'll do the multiplication 2*4 which equals 8. Then I'll add 5 to that. So, the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Um, I think I just add 5 and 3 together and then multiply that sum by 2. So, it's like this: (5 + 3) * 2 = 8 * 2 = 16. 
The answer is 16.","GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication which is 3 * 2  and the answer is 6. Then we add 5 + 6. 
So, the answer is 11.","GPT Response: First, you multiply 3 and 2 to get 6. Then, you add 5 to 6.
The answer is 11.","GPT Response: First, I'll do the multiplication 3*2 which equals 6. Then I'll add 5 to that. So the answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: I don't really know about order of operations, but my teacher says that we should just go from left to right. So, 7*2 is 14 and 8*5 is 40. So, 14 + 40 is 54. 
The answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, I will just do 7*2 which equals 14. Then I will do 8*5 which equals 40. Then I will add 14 and 40 together, and the answer is 54. So my final answer is 54.","GPT Response: Ummm... I think I just do the multiplication from left to right. So, 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40. So the answer is 14 + 40, which is 54. So, the answer is 54.","GPT Response: So first, I just do the multiplication from left to right. 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40. Then I just add those together to get 54. 
The answer is 54."
