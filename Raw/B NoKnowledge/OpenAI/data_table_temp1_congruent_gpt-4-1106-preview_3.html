      <td>GPT Response: Uh, so I haven't learned about this order of operations thing yet, but I think I remember my older sibling mentioning something about doing stuff in parentheses first. So let's try that!<br><br>First, I'll add the numbers in the parentheses because that seems like a good place to start:<br>2 + 5 equals 7.<br><br>Okay, I think I'm supposed to do the multiplication parts next because my friend said that multiplication comes before addition and subtraction. So I'm going to multiply 4 times what I got in the parentheses (which was 7), and then multiply 2 times 3:<br><br>4 times 7 equals 28,<br>and 2 times 3 equals 6.<br><br>Now, I just have addition and subtraction left. I just go from left to right now, right? So I add 28 and 12 which is 40, and then subtract the 6:<br><br>40 minus 6 equals 34.<br><br>So after I did all that, the answer I got is:<br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, since I'm not familiar with the order of operations, let's try to solve it step by step as I would see it:<br><br>4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3<br><br>First, I see there's a part in parentheses: (2 + 5). I think I've heard that you do the stuff in parentheses first.<br><br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now replace that into the equation:<br><br>4*7 + 12 - 2*3<br><br>Then, I see multiplication, which I think I should do next.<br><br>4*7 is 28<br>2*3 is 6<br><br>Replace those into the equation:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Now I just add and subtract from left to right.<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So, the final answer looks to be:<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Uh, so I think you first do the adding and subtracting stuff, then the timesing things. So inside the brackets it's 2 plus 5, which is 7, and then on the end, I've got 12 minus something...oh, 2 times 3, which is 6, so that's like 12 minus 6, which is 6.<br><br>Then I just have to do 4 times the 7 from the brackets, 4 times 7 is...28!<br><br>Now I just add the stuff left so, it's 28 plus 6, which I think is 34. So yeah, that's my answer!<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I think we have to do some things before others. I heard my teacher say we should do the stuff in parentheses first, so that's 2 + 5. That's 7. Then we have to do the multiplication before we add or subtract.<br><br>So now we have 4 times 7 because we did the 2 + 5 first, which is 28. Now we write down the rest of the problem with 28 instead of the 4*(2 + 5) part: 28 + 12 - 2*3. We still gotta do multiplication before adding, so let's do the 2*3 part. That's 6.<br><br>Now we replace the 2*3 with 6, and the equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6. Now we just do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So 28 plus 12 is 40, and then 40 minus 6 is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think we just do the multiplication part first and then add the last number. So, I'll multiply 4 times 3 which is 12, and then add 2 to that. So 12 plus 2 is 14. <br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, since I haven't learned about the order of operations yet, I would probably just solve this from left to right, like I read a book!<br><br>First, I would multiply 4 by 3 because that comes first. So, 4 times 3 equals 12.<br><br>Then, I would add 2 to that result, because that's what comes next in the question. So, 12 plus 2 equals 14.<br><br>So, my answer to the math problem would be: The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: When I do math problems, my teacher says I should do the multiplying part before the adding part. So first I have to multiply 4 and 3 together. That gives me 12.

      <td>GPT Response: Since I am a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations, I might just solve this from left to right as I would read a sentence.<br><br>First, I would add 5 to 2, which gives me 7.<br><br>Then, I would multiply 7 by 4, which gives me 28.<br><br>So I would think the answer is 28, but I just learned that there is something called the order of operations, which means that you have to multiply before you add.<br><br>Let's try that:<br><br>First, multiply 2 by 4, which gives 8.<br><br>Then, add 5 to 8, which gives 13.<br><br>So the correct answer, using the order of operations, is actually 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, since I haven't learned about the order of operations yet, I might just do the math from left to right like I read a sentence.<br><br>So I would first add 5 + 2 which is 7.

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, order of operations? I think my older sister mentioned this once. She said there's like a rule or a way to remember what to do first. I think it was something like "please excuse my dear aunt sally" which apparently stands for parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction, or maybe it was multiplication or division and addition or subtraction?<br><br>Anyway, I don't see any parentheses here or exponents, and it seems like multiplication comes before addition if I'm remembering what my sister said right. So, I'll do the multiplication parts first and then the addition.<br><br>So, for the first part, we have 7 times 2, which is 14, and then for the second part, we have 8 times 5, which is 40.<br><br>Then, I just need to add those two results together: 14 plus 40.<br><br>14 plus 40 equals 54.<br><br>So, the answer is 54.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: I think we need to do all the multiplication first and then the addition because my teacher said that multiplication comes before addition in the 'please excuse my dear aunt Sally' thingy. <br><br>So first I'll do 7 times 2 which is 14, and then 8 times 5 which is 40. <br><br>Now I add those two together: 14 plus 40 equals 54.<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
