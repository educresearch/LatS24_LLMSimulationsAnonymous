      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so even if I don't know about the order of operations yet, I might start off by doing what seems most obvious or natural to me. I know multiplication means adding the same number many times and addition is combining numbers together. <br><br>First, I might think I should just calculate everything from left to right like I read a book.<br><br>So first, I'd multiply 4 times 2 which gives 8. Then I see a plus sign and the number 5, so I add those to get 13. Then I just keep moving to the right, adding 12 to get 25, then subtracting 2 to get 23, and lastly multiplying by 3 to get 69. <br><br>But this feels a bit mixed up because I haven't used any brackets and in class, brackets seem important. So, maybe I should do the addition inside the bracket first because it's kind of like a 'mini task' inside the problem.<br><br>So if I follow that, I add 2 + 5 to get 7. Then I multiply that by 4 because it's like saying I have 4 groups of whatever is inside the bracket. So, 4 times 7 is 28. <br><br>Now I have 28 plus 12, which is 40. <br><br>Finally, I need to subtract twice the 3, which means 2 times 3, so that's 6.<br><br>Taking 6 away from 40 then gives me 34. <br><br>So, with the bit about brackets I kind of remember, I would say:<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I'm in 6th grade and am not familiar with the order of operations, but let's try to figure it out step by step!<br><br>First, from what I remember, we usually do the stuff inside brackets first. So let's do that:<br><br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now the equation looks like this:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I think we are supposed to do multiplication before addition and subtraction. So we multiply 4 times 7 and 2 times 3:<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>Now the equation looks like this:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Lastly, we just add and subtract from left to right:<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So, the final answer is 34. The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, okay! So I'm not really sure about special rules, but I can try to solve this by doing what seems right. First, I'm gonna add and subtract things and then do the multiplication part. So, I will start by adding 2 plus 5, which is 7. And then I'll add 12. That makes 19. Then it says to subtract 2 times 3, which is 6 from... umm, I think I subtract it from the 19? So 19 minus 6 is 13. Oh, and there's also a 4 times something at the beginning. So I take the 4 and times the 7, because I did 2 plus 5 already. That's 28. So now I have 28 and 13, and I add those together to get 41.<br><br>The answer is 41.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Um, okay, I guess first I'll do what's in the parentheses because my teacher said you always do that first. So 2 plus 5 is 7.<br><br>Then I have 4 times 7 because that's like 4 groups of 7. I count on my fingers or draw it out, so that makes 28.<br><br>Now it looks like I have 28 plus 12 minus 2 times 3. My teacher says I should do the times next. So 2 times 3 is like 2 groups of 3 which is 6.<br><br>So now I have 28 plus 12, which is 40, and then I subtract the 6 from before.<br><br>So it's 40 minus 6. And that's like if I have 40 candies and eat 6, I have 34 left.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Um, I think I just do what's in front of me from left to right, like when I read. So first I see 4 times 3, which is 12. Then I just need to add 2 to that, so it's 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I just learned about adding and multiplying numbers. I think I just do it from left to right, like reading a book! So first I see 4 times 3, which is 4 plus 4 plus 4, and that's 12. Then I see I have to add 2 to that. So 12 plus 2 is like 12 and then 2 more, which is 14. So I think the answer is 14!<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: We have to solve 4 times 3 plus 2. <br><br>First, we do 4 times 3 which is 12. <br>Then we add 2 to 12 which gives us 14.<br><br>So the answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Um, I think you just do the multiplication part first because that's like a rule I heard before. So, you do 2 times 4 which is 8, and then you add 5 to that. So 5 plus 8 is 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I'm not sure about special rules, but I know how to add and multiply. So I'm going to start with the adding because that's the first thing I see. <br><br>5 plus 2 is 7. <br><br>And then I know 7 times 4 is 28 because I've practiced my multiplication tables a lot!<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: When we do math problems like this, it's like when you follow steps to make a craft in class. You have to do the steps in the right order for it to come out right.<br><br>For this problem, it's like our teacher told us that we have to do the times part (multiplication) before we do the adding part.<br><br>So first we multiply 2 times 4, which gives us 8, and then we add that to 5.<br><br>5 + 2 * 4<br>= 5 + (2 * 4)<br>= 5 + 8<br>= 13<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Um, I think you have to do the multiplication part before you add. So, first you multiply 3 by 2, which is 6, and then you add the 5. That gives us 5 + 6, which adds up to 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think I just add all the numbers together because that's what you do in math. So I would do 5 plus 3 which is 8, and then I add 2 more, and that makes 10. So I think the answer is 10. <br><br>The answer is 10.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: When we do math problems like this, we need to remember that there's a special rule that tells us to do the multiplication before the addition.

      <td>GPT Response: So, I'm not sure about all the rules, but I think we can just do the math from left to right, like reading a book. So first, we'll do 7 times 2, which is 14.

Then I see plus 8, so I think I add that next, which makes 22. After that, I see times 5, so I multiply all of that by 5. Hmm, 22 times 5 is like... 5 times 20 plus 5 times 2, which is 100 plus 10, so that's 110!<br><br>The answer is 110.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I think what I need to do is just solve it in the order I see it. So first, I'll multiply 7 by 2, and then I'll multiply 8 by 5.<br><br>So for 7 times 2, that's like saying 7 plus 7, which is 14.<br><br>And for 8 times 5, I know that 5 plus 5 is 10, and if I have that 4 times because 8 is like 5 plus 3, it's like 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 10, which gives me 40.<br><br>Now, I just need to add those two together: 14 plus 40.<br><br>14 plus 40 is like saying 10 plus 40 which is 50, and then add the 4, so that's 54.<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
