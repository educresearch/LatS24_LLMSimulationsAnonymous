gpt-4-0613,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, I would just calculate everything from left to right, just like when I'm reading a book.

So the first thing to do is 4 times 2, which is 8. Then, adding 5 gives us 13. Adding 12 to that gives us 25. After that, subtracting 2 times 3 (which is 6) gives us 19.

The answer is 19.","GPT Response: Alright, so, since I don't know the order of operations, I'm going to solve this from left to right!

First, I'll multiply 4 by 2, which gives me 8. 

Then, I'll add that to 5, and get 13.

Next, I'll add that to 12, which gives me 25.

Finally, I'll subtract 2 times 3 from 25. 2 times 3 is 6, so 25 minus 6 results is 19.

The answer is 19.","GPT Response: First, I'll add the 2 and 5 inside the parentheses to get 7. Then, I'll multiply 4 with 7 to get 28. Next, I will add 28 and 12 to get 40. After that, I'll multiply 2 and 3 to get 6. Last, I'll subtract 6 from 40 to get 34. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: So, first I would add 2+5 since that seems easy. That's 7. Then I would multiply 4 by 7 because 4 times 2 plus 5 is just 4 times 7. That's 28. Then, I would add 12 to 28 because it's next. That gets me to 40. After that, I would just subtract 2 times 3 from 40. So, 40 minus 2 times 3 is 40 minus 6. That's 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Based on how I understand math so far, I would first multiply 4 and 3, which equals 12. Then, I would add 2 to 12 which gives me 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, I'll multiply 4 and 3 which gives me 12. Then, I'll add 2 to 12. This will give 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, I would multiply 4 and 3 together because 4 has 3, 3 times. So, that will be 12. After that, I'd add the 2 that was left over. So, combining these together, 12 and 2 adds up to 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a kid who doesn't know the order of operations yet, I will solve this problem from left to right, just like how we read. So, I first multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then, I add 2 to 12 and get 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Based on my understanding, I would first add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then I would multiply 7 by 4 to give 28. 

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, I'll add the 5 and 2 together to get 7. Then, I'll multiply that 7 by 4. So 7 times 4 equals 28. The answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, I would add 5 and 2 together to get 7. Then, I would multiply 7 by 4 to get 28.

So the answer is 28.","GPT Response: Since I've not learned anything about the order of operations yet, I will solve this problem from left to right, just like how we read. So, I first add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then I multiply 7 by 4 to get 28.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Based on how I understand this math problem, I would first add 5 and 3, which equals 8. Then, I would multiply that answer by 2. That would give me 16. So, according to these steps, the answer should be 16.

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: First, I'll add the 5 and 3 together to get 8. Then, I'll multiply that 8 by 2. So 8 times 2 equals 16.

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: First, I would add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then I would multiply 8 by 2 to get 16. 

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Since I've not learned anything about the order of operations yet, I will solve this problem from left to right, just like how we read. So, I first add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then I multiply 8 by 2 to get 16.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: I don't know what PEMDAS is, so I'm just going to solve it from left to right because that's how I read things.

First, I multiply 7 by 2 which gives me 14.
Then, I add 8 to 14 which gives me 22.
Finally, I multiply 22 by 5 which gives me 110.

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: Okay, so let me try to solve this. First, I'll multiply 7 by 2, which gives us 14. Then  I'll multiply 8 by 5, which gives us 40. After that, I'll add the two results, 14 and 40, and they sum up to 54. 

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, let's do the multiplication because I think it's easier. 7 times 2 equals 14. Then 8 times 5 equals 40. After that, let's add the two results together. So 14 plus 40 equals 54.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, we'll multiply 7*2 which is 14. Then, we'll multiply 8*5 which is 40. After that, we'll add 14 and 40, which is 54. 

The answer is 54."
