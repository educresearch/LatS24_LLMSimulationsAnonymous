      <td>GPT Response: To solve this math problem, I need to follow the order of operations. The order is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). <br><br>First, I will solve what is inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7<br>Now, the expression becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I perform the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6<br>The expression is now: 28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Finally, I calculate the addition and subtraction from left to right:<br>28 + 12 = 40 and 40 - 6 = 34<br><br>Therefore, the final answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we start by calculating the expression inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5. This gives us 7.<br>Next, we multiply 4 by 7, which gives us 28.<br>Then, we add 12 to 28, which gives us 40.<br>After that, we multiply 2 by 3, which gives us 6.<br>Finally, we subtract 6 from 40, which gives us 34.<br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. First, we do the calculations inside the parentheses. The expression inside the parentheses is 2+5, which equals 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. <br><br>Next, we do the calculations outside the parentheses. We subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which equals 6. <br><br>Finally, we add 12 to 28 and subtract 6 from the result. <br><br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so the problem is 4 times (2 plus 5) plus 12 minus 2 times 3. First, we do the addition inside the parentheses, which is 2 plus 5 equals 7. Then we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. Next, we do the multiplication of 2 times 3, which is 6. Then we subtract 6 from 28, which is 22. Finally, we add 12 to 22, which gives us the final answer of 34. <br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
