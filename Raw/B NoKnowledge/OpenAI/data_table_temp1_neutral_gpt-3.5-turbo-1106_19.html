      <td>4*(2+5)+12-2*3</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Um, I don't really know how to do this, but I think you have to do the stuff inside the parentheses first. So, 2+5 is 7. Then, I think you do the multiplication first, so 4*7 is 28. Then, you do the addition and subtraction from left to right, so 28+12 is 40 and 40-2 is 38. Lastly, you do the multiplication, so 2*3 is 6. So, I think the answer is 38-6. The answer is 32.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I just multiply 4 and 7 because there are no parentheses around them. The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses, 2+5 which equals 7. Then we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. After that, we add 12 to 28, which equals 40. Finally, we subtract 2 times 3, which equals 6. So the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses. 2 + 5 equals 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. Next, we calculate 2 multiplied by 3 which equals 6. Now we are left with 28 + 12 - 6. Finally, we add 28 and 12 to get 40, and then subtract 6 from 40 to get the final answer. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
