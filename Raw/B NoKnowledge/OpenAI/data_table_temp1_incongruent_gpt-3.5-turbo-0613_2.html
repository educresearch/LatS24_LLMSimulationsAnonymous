      <td>GPT Response: First, we need to start by solving the expression inside the parentheses. Adding 2 and 5 gives us 7. <br><br>Next, we calculate the multiplication on the outside. Multiplying 4 by 7 gives us 28.<br><br>Then, we need to solve the multiplication on the right. Multiplying 2 by 3 gives us 6.<br><br>Now, we can simplify the expression further. Subtracting 6 from 28 gives us 22.<br><br>Finally, we add 12 to 22 to get the final answer. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we need to solve the numbers inside the parentheses. The numbers inside the parentheses are 2 and 5, and we add them together to get 7. <br><br>The expression now becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. <br><br>Next, we need to multiply. The multiplication we need to do is 4 * 7, which equals 28. <br><br>Now the expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3. <br><br>Next, we need to solve the multiplication again. The multiplication we need to do is 2 * 3, which equals 6. <br><br>The expression now becomes: 28 + 12 - 6. <br><br>Finally, we perform the addition and subtraction in order from left to right. <br><br>28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 6 equals 34. <br><br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to follow a specific order. First, I need to calculate what is inside the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, I add 2 and 5 together, which equals 7. Now, the problem becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, I need to do the multiplication. 4 multiplied by 7 is 28, and 2 multiplied by 3 is 6. Now, I have: 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Finally, I can do the addition and subtraction. 28 plus 12 is 40, and 40 minus 6 is 34.<br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so here's what I did. First, I saw the numbers in parentheses, 2 and 5. I added them together to get 7. Then I multiplied 4 by 7 to get 28. After that, I added 12 to 28 to get 40. And finally, I saw 2 times 3 and got 6. So, I subtracted 6 from 40 to get 34. <br>The answer is 34.</td>
