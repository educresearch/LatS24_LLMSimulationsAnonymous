gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Oh gosh, okay, I'm not really sure about all these brackets and stuff, but I think I have to do the things in the parentheses first. So if I look at the problem, I see:

4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3

First, I'll add the 2 and the 5 together because they're inside the parentheses!

2 + 5 = 7

Now it looks like:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Then I think I have to do the multiplication before the adding and subtracting, because my teacher mentioned that once. So I'll multiply 4 times 7 and then 2 times 3:

4 * 7 = 28

2 * 3 = 6

So now it's:

28 + 12 - 6

Now, I'll just add and subtract from left to right, because that's how you read a sentence!

First, add 28 and 12:

28 + 12 = 40

Then subtract 6 from 40:

40 - 6 = 34

So, the final answer... The answer is 34.","GPT Response: I'm not sure what PEMDAS is, but I heard once from my older sister that you should do what's inside the parentheses first. So let's do that!

First, we handle the parentheses:
(2 + 5) equals 7.

Now the equation looks like this:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I think you do the multiplication before you do the addition or subtraction. So let's do the two multiplications:

4 * 7 equals 28.
2 * 3 equals 6.

Now we replace those in the equation and it looks like this:
28 + 12 - 6

Now, we just do the addition and subtraction from left to right, I guess:

28 + 12 equals 40.
40 - 6 equals 34.

So the final answer is 34!
The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Well, since I don't know about order of operations yet, I would probably just do the math from left to right, like reading a book! So here's how it goes:

First I see 4 and then a star that usually means times, so I would say 4 times something, and then I see those curvy lines with 2+5 inside. I'm not sure what those mean but I think I should just add those first. So 2 plus 5 is 7.

Now, I have 4 times 7, which I think is 28. 

Next, I see a plus sign and 12, so I would add 12 to 28 which is 40.

Then there's a minus sign and the number 2, so if I take 2 away from 40, I get 38.

And lastly, I see 2 starred by 3 again, so I multiply those and get 6.

Now I need to take away 6 from 38, and that leaves me with 32.

The answer is 32.","GPT Response: Okay! So first, I think we should do what's inside the parentheses because my teacher said that's like doing the 'please' in 'please excuse my dear Aunt Sally,' which stands for parentheses first!

So, inside the parentheses is 2 + 5, which adds up to 7.

Now the problem looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I think we should do the multiplication because that's like the 'excuse' and 'dear' in 'please excuse my dear Aunt Sally'. 

So, 4 times 7 is 28. And 2 times 3 is 6.

Now our problem is: 28 + 12 - 6

Now we just need to add and subtract in the order we see them. So, 28 plus 12 is 40.

Finally 40 minus 6 is 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about order of operations yet, I might just solve this from left to right like reading a book.

First, I would multiply 4 by 3, because that's the first thing I see. So that's:

4 * 3 = 12

Then I would add 2 to that result:

12 + 2 = 14

So, if I did it this way, I would say:

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Since I haven't learned about the order of operations yet, I might just calculate this from left to right like I would read a sentence. 

First, I'll multiply 4 and 3 which is 12.

4 * 3 = 12

Then, I'll add 2 to the result of that multiplication.

12 + 2 = 14

So, doing it this way, the result I get is:

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Oh, I learned that when you have numbers and plus and times, you can just go from left to right like reading a book! So first I would do the 4 times 3 which is 12, and then I would add the 2. So 12 plus 2 is 14! 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Oh, I remember my teacher saying something about doing multiplying first before adding! So first, I'll do 4 times 3 which is 12. Then I'll take that 12 and add 2 to it. That would be 14!

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about order of operations yet, I might first add 5 and 2 together because they are next to each other, and then multiply the result by 4.

So it would look like:
First, I add 5 + 2 which equals 7.
Then, I multiply 7 by 4 which equals 28.

However, I know my teacher mentioned something about doing multiplying before adding. If I was to follow that, it would look like this:

First, I multiply 2 by 4 which equals 8.
Then, I add 5 to the 8, which equals 13.

This second way seems to be the way my teacher wanted us to do it. So:

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who hasn't learned about the order of operations yet, I might think I just need to solve this from left to right. So first, I would add 5 and 2 to get 7, and then I would multiply that by 4.

7 (from adding 5 and 2) times 4 equals 28.

So I would say the answer is 28. However, I should actually learn the correct order of operations, which is PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right). According to that, I need to do the multiplication before the addition.

First, 2 times 4 is 8. Then, I add that to 5 to get 13.

Using PEMDAS, the correct answer is 13. But since I don't know that yet, I might initially think the answer is 28.","GPT Response: Oh, I learned that when you have numbers and plus signs and times signs, you can just do the math from left to right like reading a book! So first I'll add 5 plus 2 because that's the first part I see, and that makes 7. Then I'll multiply the 7 by 4 because that's the next part. So 7 times 4 is 28. 

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: When I do math problems, my teacher told me that I have to do multiplication before addition. So I will first multiply 2 times 4 which is 8. Then I add the 5. So 5 plus 8 equals 13!

The answer is 13."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about order of operations yet, I might just solve this from left to right like I read a book. 

So I would do the addition first, which is 5 + 3, and that equals 8. Then I would multiply that by 2, so 8 * 2 equals 16.

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Since I haven't learned about the order of operations yet, I might mistakenly think that I should just calculate from left to right. So I would add 5 and 3 to get 8, and then multiply that by 2, which would give me 16. However, this is not the correct method.

But I've heard my older sister talking about something called PEMDAS, which means you do Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

There are no parentheses or exponents in this problem, so according to that rule, I should do the multiplication first. That means I would multiply 3 by 2 to get 6, and then I add that to 5. So, 5 plus 6 equals 11. 

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Oh, I learned that when you have numbers and plus and times, you should just solve it like a sentence from left to right. So first I would add 5 plus 3 which makes 8. Then I multiply 8 by 2 and that makes 16!

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: When you have addition and multiplication in the same math problem, you have to do the multiplication part first before you do the addition. So you'll multiply 3 times 2 first. That gives you 6. Then you take that answer and add it to 5. So the problem looks like this now: 5 + 6. When you add 5 plus 6, you get 11.

So the answer is 11."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Oh, okay. So I think I should probably just solve this like a puzzle, going from left to right, like when I read a book!

First, I'd do 7 times 2 which is 14. Then with the 14 there, I'd move on and add the next part, which is 8 times 5, that's 40. So my equation now looks like 14 + 40.

Now I just add those two together - 14 plus 40 equals 54.

So I did that right, right? Anyway, the answer is 54.","GPT Response: Oh, I remember my teacher talking about this thing called PEMDAS or ""Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally."" It stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Since there are no parentheses or exponents in this problem, we just need to do the multiplication and then the addition.

First, I'll multiply 7 by 2, which is 14. Then I'll multiply 8 by 5, which is 40. Now I have two numbers, 14 and 40, and I need to add them up.

So, 14 + 40 equals 54.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Oh, I'm not sure what the exact rules are, but I think I'll just do the math from left to right, like I read a book. So, first I'll do 7 times 2 which is 14, and then I'll add 8 and that equals 22. Then I multiply 22 by 5, and that gives me 110.
