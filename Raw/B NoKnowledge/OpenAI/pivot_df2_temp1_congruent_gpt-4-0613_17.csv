gpt-4-0613,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would just calculate it as it's written from left to right. Here's how I would do it:

First, I would do the multiplication: 4 * 2 = 8.
Then, I add 5 to get 8 + 5 = 13.
Then, I add 12 to get 13 + 12 = 25.
Finally, I subtract 2 times 3, which is 6, so 25 - 6 = 19.

The answer is 19.","GPT Response: I am not sure about the right order to solve this, but I'll try:
First, I'll solve the numbers in the brackets, so 2 + 5 equals 7.
Then, I'll multiply 4 with that result, so 4 * 7 equals 28.
Next, I'll add 12 to that number, so 28 + 12 equals 40.
Finally,  I'll subtract 2*3 which is 6 from 40, so 40 - 6 equals 34.
So, based on my calculations, The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I'd just solve this from left to right.

First, I'd multiply 4 with 2, which gives us 8. Then, I'd add 5 to 8, which makes it 13.

Next, I'd add 12, making 25. 
Then, I subtract 2, making it 23.
Finally, I multiply by 3, ending up with 69.

The answer is 69.","GPT Response: Since I'm an elementary student who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I would just solve the problem from left to right.

First, I'll add 2 and 5 which gives me 7.
Then, I multiply 4 and 7 which equals 28.
Next, I add 12 to 28 which gives me 40.
Finally, I subtract 2 multiplied by 3 (which is 6) from 40.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would calculate the problem from left to right as I see it.

First, I would multiply 4 by 3 which gives 12.

Then, I would add 2 to the 12 I got from the multiplication. 

12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Since I am a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I'll solve the problem from left to right. First, I'll multiply 4 and 3 which gives me 12. Then, I'll add 2 to 12 which gives me 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Since I'm supposed to solve this like an elementary student who doesn't know about the order of operations, I'll just solve it from left to right!

First, I'll multiply 4 by 3, which gives me 12.

Then, I'll add 2 to that result. So, 12 plus 2 is 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: We start solving from left to right, that's how I read sentences in my books. The first thing I read is 4*3 which gives us 12. Then I see the plus sign and 2. So, I add 12 and 2 and it equals 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would calculate the problem from left to right as I see it.

First, I would add 5 + 2 which equals 7.

Then, I would multiply this result by 4 getting 7 * 4 = 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Since I am a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would solve the problem from left to right. First, I would add 5 + 2 which equals 7. Then, I would multiply 7 by 4 and get 28. 

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Since I'm not aware of any particular order in which I should solve this, I'm going to solve it just like I read a book, from left to right. 

First, I'm adding 5 + 2, which gives me 7. Then, I'm multiplying that result by 4. Therefore, 7*4 gives me 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: We start solving from left to right, that's how I read sentences in my books. The first thing I read is 5 plus 2, which is 7. After that the problem becomes 7 times 4, and that's 28.

The answer is 28."

gpt-4-0613,1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would just perform the operations in the order they appear.

First, I would multiply 7 by 2, which gives 14.

Then, I would add 8 to 14, which results in 22.

After that, I will multiply 22 by 5, which is 110.

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I will just read the problem from left to right and solve it.

First, I'll solve 7*2 which equals to 14. 
Then, I'll add 8 to 14 because the problem said ""+8"", which gives us 22.
And then, I'll multiply that result by 5 because it said ""*5"", so 22*5 is 110.

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: Well, since I don't know about the order of operations, I'll just solve the problem from left to right.

First, I'll multiply 7 by 2, which gives me 14. Then, I'll add 8 to 14, which gives me 22. Lastly, I'll multiply 22 by 5, which gives me 110.

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: Okay, so we just do each part in order.
First, we do 7*2 which is 14. Then we do 8*5 which is 40. 
After that, we just add those two together. So, 14 + 40 = 54.
