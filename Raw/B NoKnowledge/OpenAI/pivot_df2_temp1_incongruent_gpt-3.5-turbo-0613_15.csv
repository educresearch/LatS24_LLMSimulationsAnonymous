gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Hmm... let me think. Okay, so in this problem, we have some numbers and some operations. First, we multiply 4 by the sum of 2 and 5. Then we add 12 to that, and subtract the product of 2 and 3. 

To solve this problem, I'll start by calculating the sum in the parentheses. 2 + 5 equals 7. 

Now I'll use the multiplication operation. 4 times 7 equals 28. 

Next, I'll do the addition. 28 plus 12 equals 40. 

Finally, I'll do the multiplication. 2 times 3 equals 6. 

So, to find the final answer, I need to subtract 6 from 40. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will follow the order of operations. In order of operations, we must first do any calculations inside parentheses. So, inside the parentheses, we have 2+5, which equals 7. 
Next, I will perform the multiplication. We have 4 multiplied by 7, which equals 28.
After that, I will do the remaining addition and subtraction from left to right. Adding 12 to 28 gives us 40. Then, subtracting 2 multiplied by 3 gives us 34.
So, the final answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we need to calculate what's inside the parentheses. In the parentheses, we have 2 + 5, which equals 7. 

Then, we multiply 4 by 7, which gives us 28.

Next, we have to simplify the expression 12 - 2 * 3. We multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. 

Finally, we subtract 6 from 12, which gives us 6. 

So the final answer is 6.","GPT Response: First, we need to solve the addition inside the parentheses. 2 plus 5 is 7.

Next, we need to multiply 4 by the result inside the parentheses. 4 times 7 is 28.

After that, we need to solve the multiplication of 2 times 3. 2 times 3 is 6.

Then, we need to subtract the result from the previous step, which is 6, from 12. 12 minus 6 is 6.

Finally, we need to add the result of the previous step, which is 6, to the result of the multiplication in step 2, which is 28. 6 plus 28 is 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34."
