gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: I don't really know how to solve this, but I think you do the operations in the order they appear from left to right. So first, I would add 5 + 2, which is 7. Then I would multiply that by 4, which is 28. So the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Um, I think you just do the operations in order from left to right. So, first you do 7 * 2, which is 14. Then you add 8 to get 22. Finally, you multiply 22 by 5, which gives you 110. So, the answer is 110."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: I don't really know how to solve this, but I think you do the operations from left to right. So, 4 times 3 is 12. Then you add 2, which is 14. So the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Um, I think I just do the operations from left to right. So that's 4 times 7, plus 12, minus 2 times 3. So that's 28 plus 12 minus 6. Um, so the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: I don't really know how to solve this, but I think you do the operations from left to right. So, 5 plus 3 is 8. Then you multiply that by 2 and get 16. So the answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: First, I'll do the multiplication which is 2 * 4 and that equals 8. Then add 5 to 8 and that equals 13. 
So, the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: First, I will multiply 7 and 2, which equals 14. Then I will multiply 8 and 5, which equals 40. Finally, I will add 14 and 40, which equals 54. Therefore, the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: First, I need to do the multiplication, so 4 * 3 equals 12. Then I just add 2 to 12, which equals 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Okay, when you solve this, you start with the parentheses first. Inside the parentheses, you add 2 and 5, which equals 7. Then you multiply that by 4, which equals 28. 

Next, you look at the subtraction and do that before moving on to the addition. So, 12 minus 2 equals 10.

Finally, you do the multiplication, which is 2 times 3, which equals 6.

So, the final answer is 28 + 10 - 6 = 32"
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: First, I need to do the multiplication first. So 3 * 2 equals 6. Then add 5 to 6. 
The answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: First I would add 5 and 2 together, which equals 7. Then I would multiply 7 by 4, which equals 28. 
The answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: So first, I would just do the multiplication from left to right. 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40. So the equation becomes 14 plus 40. Then you just add 14 and 40 together to get the final answer.

The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: First I would just do 4 times 3 which is 12. Then I add 2 to that, that's 14. 
So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, you should do the stuff in the parentheses, so 2 + 5 equals 7. Then do 4 times 7 which equals 28. After that, do 2 times 3 which equals 6. Finally, add 12 and subtract 6 from 28. So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: First, I just do the math from left to right. So, 5 plus 3 equals 8. Then I multiply 8 by 2, which equals 16. So, the answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: First, we solve 2 * 4, which is 8. Then we add 5 to 8. So, 5 + 2 * 4 = 13. 
The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: First, I'll just do the multiplication from left to right. So 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40. Then, I just add 14 and 40 together to get the final answer. 

The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: First, we solve 4 * 3, which is 12. Then we add 2 to 12. So, the answer is 14.  The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7. Then we multiply 4 by 7 which equals 28. Then, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3 from 28, which equals 22. Finally, we add 12 to get the final answer.
