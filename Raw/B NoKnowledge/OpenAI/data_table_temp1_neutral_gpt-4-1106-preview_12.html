      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I just learned this cool rule called PEMDAS, which helps us solve math problems like this! It stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>So first, I do what's in the parentheses:<br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now, I do the multiplication:<br>4 * 7 = 28<br>and 2 * 3 = 6<br><br>After that, I do the addition and subtraction, from left to right:<br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>Lastly, I subtract the 6:<br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So, the final answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, I don't know what PEMDAS is, but I think we have to do some things before others in this math problem. <br><br>So first, I see there are parentheses in "4*(2+5)". We should probably do what's inside them first. So, 2 plus 5 is 7. Now we can replace that part of the problem with 7, so we have:<br><br>4*7+12-2*3<br><br>Now we have multiplication and addition and subtraction. I've heard that multiplication comes before addition and subtraction, so let's do that next.<br><br>4 times 7 is 28. And we also have 2 times 3, which is 6. Let's put those back into the problem:<br><br>28+12-6<br><br>Now we just have addition and subtraction left. I think we can do this in order from left to right:<br><br>28 plus 12 is 40, and then 40 minus 6 is 34.<br><br>So, the final answer is 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I learned that when we have a problem with lots of different math things to do, like multiply and add, we should do the part in the parentheses first! So I'll start with (2+5).<br><br>2 plus 5 is 7.<br><br>Now I'll replace the (2+5) with 7, so the problem looks like this:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I remember my teacher saying that we should do the multiplication before the addition and subtraction. So I'll multiply 4 times 7, and then 2 times 3.<br><br>4 times 7 is 28, and 2 times 3 is 6.<br><br>If I put that into the problem, it looks like this:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Now I just need to add and subtract from left to right.<br><br>First, I'll add 28 and 12, which is 40.<br><br>Then I take that 40 and subtract 6, which gives me 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I learned this just a little while ago! My teacher said that we need to do the math problems in a special order, like when we follow the rules in class.<br><br>First, we have to do what's inside the parentheses. So I'll add 2 + 5. That's 7!<br>Next, we do the multiplication and division from left to right. My teacher said it's like reading a book!<br><br>So first, we'll do 4 times the number we got from the parentheses, which is 7. 4 times 7 is 28.<br><br>Now we look at the problem again and it looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2*3.<br><br>We still have more multiplying to do! The 2 times 3 part comes next. That's 6.<br><br>Now the problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Then we do the adding and subtracting from left to right. So first, we add 28 and 12. That makes 40! Lastly, we subtract 6 from 40, and that gives us 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>4*3+2</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think we have to do something about the times and the plus. If I remember correctly, my teacher said we should do the multiplication first before we add. So, I should do 4 times 3 which is 12, and then add the 2 after. Let me do that now:<br><br>4 * 3 = 12<br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think I just do the operations one by one from left to right. So first I multiply 4 with 3, which is 12. Then, I add 2 to that number, which makes it 14. The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I'm not really sure about any rules for this. I think you just do the math from left to right, like reading a book! First I'll do 4 times 3, which is 12, and then I'll add 2 to that. So 12 plus 2 is 14. <br><br>So, the answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: You just solve it going from left to right, so you do 4 times 3 first which is 12, and then you add 2 to that, so it's 14 altogether. <br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>5+2*4</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think I remember my teacher mentioning that when there's a problem with different operations like plus and times, I should do the multiplication part first before I add. So, I should multiply 2 by 4 first, which is 8, and then add the 5.<br><br>So it goes like this:<br><br>1. Do the multiplication: 2 * 4 = 8<br>2. Then do the addition: 5 + 8 = 13<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think I remember my teacher talking about something like this. She said that we have to do multiplication and division before we do addition and subtraction. So for this problem, I need to multiply 2 and 4 first before I add the 5.<br><br>So, 2 times 4 is 8.<br><br>Then, I add the 5 to the 8.<br><br>5 + 8 equals 13.<br><br>So, the answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I'm not really sure about any special rules for this. But I'll just try to solve it from left to right like I read a book!<br><br>First, I see 5 plus 2, which is 7. Then, the question says to multiply by 4. So I'll just multiply 7 by 4. That makes 28.<br><br>So I think the answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: You know, my teacher told us that when you see a problem like this, we have to do the multiplication part before the addition part. So we have to multiply 2 times 4 first, which is 8. Then we add that to 5. So if we add 5 plus 8, that gives us 13. So,<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

So, I'd do 3 times 2 first which is 6, and then I add the 5. So it's 5 plus 6, which equals 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think I remember my teacher saying something about how there's a special way to do these problems. If I have both addition and multiplication in a problem, I need to do the multiplication part first before I do the addition. <br><br>So I should do 3 times 2 first, which is 6. <br><br>Then, I add that to 5. So 5 plus 6 is 11. <br><br>The answer is 11.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: To solve 5 + 3 * 2, you should do the multiplication part first before you do the addition. So first you do 3 times 2, which is 6, and then you add that to 5.

      <td>7*2+8*5</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I'm not really sure what this PEMDAS thing is, but I think you just do the math from left to right, right? So first, Iâ€™d do 7 times 2 which is 14. Then you have 14 plus... um, then I have to do 8 times 5 which is 40. So now it's like 14 plus 40, and when you add those together you get 54. <br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Even though I don't know about the official order of operations, I can solve the problem by doing the calculations step by step.<br><br>So first I will do the multiplications because they just seem more complicated, and I think you do the hard stuff first.<br><br>7 times 2 is 14.<br>8 times 5 is 40.<br><br>Now, I have 14 and 40. I will add those together because that's what is left to do.<br><br>14 + 40 equals 54.<br><br>So, my final answer is:<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, okay. So I think what we do is just go from left to right, like when we read! First we do 7 times 2 which I know is 14. Then we have 14 plus... then we do 8 times 5 next, right? I know that's 40. So now we have to add 14 and 40. <br><br>If I add 14 and 40, It's like adding 10+40 which is 50, and then adding 4 more to make 54. So I think the result is like adding up everything straight in a line!<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I do the multiplication because my teacher said that comes before addition. So I multiply 7 times 2 which is 14. Then I multiply 8 times 5 which is 40. Now I have 14 plus 40. Then I add those two numbers together. 14 plus 40 is 54. So,<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
