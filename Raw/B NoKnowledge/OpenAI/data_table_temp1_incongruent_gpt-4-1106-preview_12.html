      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I'm not sure about all the rules, but I think we should probably do the stuff inside the parentheses first because it's like doing the inside part of a problem before you can do the outside part.<br><br>So we have 2 + 5 inside the parentheses. That's easy! 2 plus 5 is 7. <br><br>Then I'd probably do the multiplication next because it seems like bigger operations than adding or subtracting. So we'd do 4 times that 7 we just got from inside the parentheses, which is 28.<br><br>Now the problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Then, I guess we just go from left to right? So add 12 to 28, which makes 40. And finally, we take that 2 times 3, which is like 2 groups of 3, which is 6.<br><br>40 minus 6 is 34.<br><br>So, using my best guess without really knowing the rules, I'd say:<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I'm not sure what "order of operations" is because I haven't learned it yet, but when I look at this problem, I think I should probably do what’s inside the parentheses first because it’s like its own little math problem.<br><br>So I see 4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>First, let's do the addition inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.<br><br>Now the equation looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, I think I should do the multiplication before doing anything else. So 4 times 7 is 28, and 2 times 3 is 6.<br><br>Now my problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Then I just go left to right. So, 28 plus 12 is 40, and 40 minus 6 is 34.<br><br>So I think the answer is 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I don't know a lot about fancy math rules, but I'll just do this the way it makes sense to me. So I think I should first do what's inside the parentheses because it's like the math inside is shouting, "Do me first!"<br><br>So I do 2 plus 5 which is 7.<br><br>Then it looks like I have 4 times that 7, plus 12, and then minus 2 times 3.<br><br>So I'd do the 4 times 7 next because that's what comes after. So that's 28.<br><br>Then I have 28 plus 12, which is 40.<br><br>And the last part is 2 times 3, which is 6.<br><br>So lastly, I take away that 6 from my 40, which leaves me with 34. <br><br>So I think the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I need to do the stuff in the parentheses because that's like the rule I learned. So I have:<br><br>4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.<br><br>Now the problem looks like this:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Then I think I have to do the multiplication before addition or subtraction because that's another rule. <br><br>So I multiply 4 times 7, which is 28. And then 2 times 3, which is 6.<br><br>Now the problem is:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Then I just go from left to right. First I add 28 and 12:<br><br>28 + 12 is 40.<br><br>Now I subtract the 6:<br><br>40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>

      <td>4 * 3+2</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, okay. So I think I just do this the way it's written, right? First I multiply, because I heard that multiplication comes before addition when you solve math problems.<br><br>So, 4 times 3 is 12. <br><br>Now, I have 12 + 2. That's easy! 12 plus 2 is 14.<br><br>So, the answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hm, I'm not sure about the official rules, but I think I should do the multiplication before the addition. So, I'll do 4 times 3 first which is 12, and then I'll add 2 to that which gives me 14!<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, okay! I think I just do the math from the left to the right, like when I read a book! So first I'll take the 4 and multiply it by 3, because that's the first thing I see. So 4 times 3 is 12, right? Then I just add 2 to that, because that’s the next thing. <br><br>So, 12 plus 2 is 14!<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm just learning this in elementary school and don't know about the official order of operations yet, I might think I just need to go from left to right like when I read a book!<br><br>So first, I'll do 4 times 3, which is 12. Then I'll add 2 to that, which makes it 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>5+2 * 4</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, okay. So I think I just do this the way it's written, right? First I add 5 plus 2, which is 7. Then, I take that 7 and multiply it by 4 because the question has a multiplication thing next to the 2. So, 7 times 4 is 28.<br><br>So I guess the answer is, well, 28. Yeah, that makes sense!<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hm, I just learned something called the order of operations. It's like a rule about which things to do first in a math problem. My teacher said we should do any parentheses first, then exponents, then multiplication and division from left to right, and lastly, addition and subtraction from left to right. They use the word PEMDAS to remember it. P is for parentheses, E is for exponents, M is for multiplication, D is for division, A is for addition, and S is for subtraction.<br><br>In this problem, 5 + 2 * 4, there are no parentheses or exponents, so I should look for multiplication or division first. There is a multiplication: 2 * 4. So I do that part first.<br><br>2 * 4 equals 8.<br><br>Now the problem is 5 + 8.<br><br>5 + 8 equals 13.<br><br>So the answer to 5 + 2 * 4, following the order of operations, is:<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think we just go from left to right. So first, we do 5 plus 2, which is 7. Then, we take that 7 and multiply it by 4. So that's like 7 four times, which is 28.<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm just learning this in elementary school and don't know about the official order of operations yet, I might think I just need to work from left to right like when I read a book. So, I would add 5 plus 2 to get 7, and then multiply 7 by 4 to get 28.<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Umm, so I think you just do it from left to right, like reading a book? So first, you'd do 5 plus 3 which is 8, and then you multiply that by 2... So 8 times 2 is 16.<br><br>The answer is 16.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hm, I'm not sure about the official rules, but I think you do the multiplying part before you add things. So, first I would multiply 3 times 2, which is 6, and then I would add the 5. So it goes like this:<br><br>3 * 2 = 6<br>Then:<br>5 + 6 = 11<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think we just do it from left to right because that's how we read! So I would add 5 plus 3 first which is 8 and then multiply that by 2. That should make it... 16, I think!<br><br>The answer is 16.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm just learning this in elementary school, here's how I might think about it: <br><br>First, I add 5 plus 3 which is 8. <br>Then, I multiply 8 by 2 which gives me 16.<br><br>So, I'd say the answer is 16. <br><br>(Note: The order of operations, which I might learn later, says to do multiplication before addition, so the actual calculation according to these rules would be 3 * 2 which is 6, then add that to 5 for a correct answer of 11. But since I'm pretending not to know this yet, I'm going with my first method!)</td>

      <td>GPT Response: To solve this math problem, we just need to solve it step by step. I'm not familiar with the order of operations rule called PEMDAS yet, which means we have to multiply and add in the order they appear from left to right. So let's do that!<br><br>First, we multiply 7 by 2, which is:<br><br>7 * 2 = 14<br><br>And then we multiply 8 by 5, which is:<br><br>8 * 5 = 40<br><br>Now, we add those two results together:<br><br>14 + 40 = 54<br><br>So the final answer is 54. <br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations yet, I would just solve this from left to right as I see it.
