gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: I'd do the multiplication first, so 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. Then I'd do the addition and subtraction from left to right, so 28 + 12 - 6. Finally, I'd do the remaining addition and subtraction, which is 40 - 6. 
The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I solve inside the parentheses, so 2 + 5 = 7. Then I do the multiplication first, so 4 * 7 = 28. After that, I add 12 to 28 to get 40. Finally, I subtract 2 * 3 from 40, which gives me 34. 
So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, you do the parentheses first, so 2+5 equals 7. Then you do the multiplication and division from left to right, so 4 times 7 equals 28 and 2 times 3 equals 6. Then you do the addition and subtraction from left to right, so 28 plus 12 equals 40 and 40 minus 6 equals 34. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I'll add 2 and 5 to get 7.
Then, I'll multiply 4 by 7 to get 28.
Next, I'll multiply 2 by 3 to get 6.
Finally, I'll add 28, 12, and subtract 6 to get the final answer!
The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: First, you just do the operations from left to right. So, you first do 4 times 3, which is 12. Then you add 2 to 12, which is 14. 
So the answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, I need to do the multiplication first, so I'll do 4 * 3, which equals 12. Then I add 2 to 12, which equals 14. So the answer is 14.","GPT Response: Um, you just do the math from left to right. So, first you do 4 times 3 which is 12, then you add 2 to get 14. So the answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication which is 4 * 3 and then we add 2 to the product. 

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5+2 * 4,GPT Response: I don't know how to solve this problem.,"GPT Response: First, I need to do the multiplication first, so I'll do 2 * 4, which equals 8. Then I add 5 to 8, which equals 13. 
So, the answer is 13.","GPT Response: Umm, I just do it from left to right, so 5 plus 2 is 7 and then times 4 is 28. 
The answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication which is 2 * 4 and my final answer is 13. The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Umm, I think I just add the 5 and 3 first, and then multiply the result by 2. So, 5+3 is 8, and 8 times 2 is 16. So, the answer is 16.","GPT Response: First, I will just add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then I will multiply 8 by 2 to get 16. 

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication, then you add. So, 3 times 2 equals 6 and then you add 5. 
The answer is 11.","GPT Response: First, I add 5 and 3 together to get 8. Then, I multiply 8 by 2 to get 16. 

The answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Umm, I don't really know what to do here, but I think I'll just solve it from left to right. So, 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40. So, the answer is 14 plus 40, which is 54. So, the answer is 54.","GPT Response: I don't really know anything about the order of operations, but I think I should just do the operations from left to right. So, 7 times 2 is 14 and then I add 8 times 5 which is 40. So, 14 plus 40 is 54. 

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Ummm, I think I just do the multiplication first and then the addition. So, 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40. Then I add those together to get 54.
So the answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, we do what is at the top, so 7 times 2 is 14, then 8 times 5 is 40. So it's 14 plus 40, which is 54. So, the answer is 54."
