gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations yet, I might just solve from left to right. So I would add 5 and 2 first, which is 7, and then multiply that by 4, which gives me 28.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Oh, I heard from my friend that in math, when you see numbers and symbols, you can't just solve them in any order. There's actually like a special set of rules. I think we're supposed to multiply before we add. So, I would do the multiplication parts first.

So the first part is 7 times 2, which is 14, and then 8 times 5, which is 40. Now I just add those two results together.

So then, 14 plus 40 is like adding 10 to 40, which is 50, and then adding 4 more, which is 54.

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations yet, I might just solve from left to right. So I would multiply 4 and 3 first because that's the first operation I see. 

4 times 3 is 12, and then I would add 2 to that. So, 12 plus 2 equals 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Well, I haven't learned about the order of operations yet, but here's how I think I would solve it:

First, I see there are some parentheses, and I think we need to do what's inside them first. So I'll start with that:

2 + 5 = 7

Next, I see we need to multiply and there are addition and subtraction too. I'm not totally sure, but I think maybe we do multiplication before we do addition or subtraction. So I'll do the multiplication parts next:

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now I have:

28 + 12 - 6

I think we can just do addition and subtraction from left to right now:

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So, putting it all together, I think the answer is:

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations yet, I might just solve from left to right. So I would add 5 and 3 first, which is 8, and then multiply that by 2, which gives me 16.

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Since I'm in the 6th grade and haven't learned about the order of operations (PEMDAS) which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), I would probably just calculate the problem from left to right the way I read it.

So, I would do:

First, I would add 5 + 2 which equals 7.
Then, I would take that 7 and multiply it by 4, which equals 28.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Okay, so I have been told that when doing math problems, I should do multiplication before I add things together. Let me try that:

First, I will multiply 7 by 2, which is 14,
and then I will multiply 8 by 5, which is 40.

After the multiplication, I have two numbers, 14 and 40.

Now I will add these two numbers together: 14 + 40 equals 54.

So, the final answer is 54. 

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Since I'm in the 6th grade and haven't learned about the order of operations (PEMDAS) which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), I would solve the math problem step by step from left to right.

So, first I would multiply 4 by 3, which is 12. And then I would add 2 to the result. So that would be:

12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Oh, I remember my teacher mentioned something about a special order we have to use when solving math problems like this one. We have to do some things before others. We do the stuff in parentheses first, then we do any multiplication or division from left to right, and finally we do the addition and subtraction from left to right. I think it's something like ""Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally"" or PEMDAS to help remember:

P - Parentheses first
E - Exponents (we don't have any in this problem)
MD - Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
AS - Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

So, following that order:

First, we solve the parentheses (2+5) which equals 7.

The equation now looks like this: 4*7+12-2*3

Next, we do the multiplication parts: 4*7 equals 28, and 2*3 equals 6.

Now the equation is: 28+12-6

We don't have any division, so now we do the addition and subtraction from left to right.

28+12 is 40. Then we subtract 6 from 40 which gives us 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Since I'm in the 6th grade and haven't learned about the order of operations (PEMDAS) which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right), I would probably just calculate the problem from left to right the way I read it.

So, I would do:

First, I would add 5 + 3 which equals 8.
Then, I would take that 8 and multiply it by 2 which would give me 16.

So, if I did not know about PEMDAS, I would probably say that the answer is 16.

However, I'm sure if you apply the correct order of operations, the multiplication should actually be done before the addition. If we calculate it correctly, 3 multiplied by 2 is 6, and then we would add 5 to get a total of 11. But since I'm supposed to act like I don't know order of operations, I'll stick with my first answer.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: If I'm in elementary school and I don't know about order of operations yet, I might just solve the problem from left to right like I read a book. So I would add 5 plus 2 to get 7, and then multiply that sum by 4 to get 28.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: If I don't know about the order of operations, I might just solve from left to right. So I would do 7 times 2 first, then add 8, then times the result by 5.

So first I do 7 times 2 which is 14. Then I would add 8 to that, getting 22. After that, I would multiply by 5. Multiplying 22 by 5 is like adding 22 together 5 times. 

So 22 plus 22 is 44, and then add another 22 to make it 66, and then another 22 to make it 88, and then one last 22 to make it 110.

So, without knowing the correct order of operations, I'd say:

The answer is 110."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Well, I don't really know about special rules for doing math problems, but I think I would just go from left to right like I read a book! So first I would take the 4 and the 3 and multiply them because I know that 4 times 3 is 12. Then, I see there's a plus sign and a 2, so I would just add 2 to the 12. So then 12 plus 2 is 14. That was fun!

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Okay, so I haven't learned about the rules for which things to do first in math problems, but I'll just try to work it out step by step, the way it makes sense to me!

First, I see there's this 4*(2+5), so maybe I add the 2 and the 5 together because they're inside the brackets, and I think brackets mean I should do that first. So, 2+5 is 7. And then there's a star thingy which I think means times, so 4 times 7 probably comes next. Four times seven is 28.

Now the rest of it is +12-2*3. I think I should just go from left to right like I'm reading a book. So I take the 28 and add 12 to it because that comes next. That gets me to 40.

After that, there is -2, so I take 40 and take away 2 which leaves me with 38.

Lastly, I see there's another times thing with 3. So 2 times 3 is 6. I think I need to take that 6 away from the 38 I have now. So 38 minus 6 is 32.

So all together, if I did that right, I think...
The answer is 32."

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Okay, so my teacher said that in math I need to do multiplication before I do adding. So, first I do 2 times 4 which is 8. And then I take that 8 and add 5 to it. 5 plus 8 is 13. So the final answer is 13. 

The answer is 13."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Okay, so if I have to solve 7 times 2 plus 8 times 5, I think I just do the times first and then the plus. So, 7 times 2 is 14 and 8 times 5 is 40. Then I just put those together with the plus. So, 14 plus 40 equals 54.

The answer is 54."

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Okay, so I'm not sure about any rules for doing math problems, so I'll just do this step by step, starting from the left. So first I see 4 times something, and that something is 2+5. 

I'll do the 2+5 first. 2 plus 5 is 7. Now I have 4 times 7, which is 28.

So now the problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2 times 3. 

Next, I add 28 and 12. That's 40.

Now I have 40 minus 2 times 3. I'll do the 2 times 3 next, which is 6.

Last step, I'll take 40 and subtract 6 from it. 40 minus 6 is 34.

The answer is 34."
