So, for math, my teacher showed us something called ""PEMDAS."" It stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and then Addition and Subtraction (also from left to right).

In this problem, there are no parentheses or exponents, so I can skip those parts. Now I just need to look for multiplication or division. The problem has two multiplication parts: 7 times 2 and 8 times 5.

7 * 2 = 14

- P for Parentheses (stuff inside the round brackets)
- E for Exponents (like if there was a 2 to the power of 3 or something, but we don't have that here)
- MD for Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
- AS for Addition and Subtraction (also from left to right)

So let's break it down!

First, we do the Parentheses:
4 * (2+5) becomes 4 * 7 because 2 + 5 is 7.

Now our problem looks like this:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next is Multiplication:
4 * 7 is 28
and 2 * 3 is 6.

So after doing that, we've got:
28 + 12 - 6

Then we just have Addition and Subtraction left, which we do from left to right:
28 + 12 is 40
And then we take away 6 from 40, which gives us 34.

First, we multiply 7 by 2, which is 14. Then, we multiply 8 by 5, which is 40. Now we just have to add those two together. 

So, 14 plus 40 equals 54. 

The answer is 54."

2 + 5 = 7

Now we replace that in our problem:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Then we have to do the multiplication before we do the addition or subtraction. So let's multiply 4 times 7, and 2 times 3:

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now we replace those in our problem:

28 + 12 - 6

Then we just add and subtract from left to right. So first we add 28 and 12:

28 + 12 = 40

And then we subtract 6 from 40:

40 - 6 = 34

So the answer is 34."
