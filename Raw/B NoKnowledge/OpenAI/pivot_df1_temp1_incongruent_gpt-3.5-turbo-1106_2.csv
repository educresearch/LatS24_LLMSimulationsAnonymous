gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2 * 4,GPT Response: I don't know how to solve this problem using order of operations. Can you show me how to do it?
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Um, so I don't really know what to do here, but I think I should just do the multiplication first and then the addition. So, 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40. Then I just have to add 14 and 40 together, which is 54.

The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * 3+2,GPT Response: I don't know what to do with this. Can you teach me?
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: I would solve this problem by doing the operations inside the parentheses first. So, 2 + 5 equals 7. Then I would do the multiplication and division from left to right, so 4 * 7 equals 28, and 2 * 3 equals 6. After that, I would do the addition and subtraction from left to right, so 28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 6 equals 34. Therefore, the final answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3 * 2,GPT Response: I don't know what to do with this. Can you teach me?
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: First, we just do the operations from left to right. 
5 + 2 equals 7, then we multiply that with 4, which equals 28.
So the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication from left to right. 
So, 7 * 2 equals 14 and 8 * 5 equals 40.
Then, we add the results together.
So, 14 + 40 equals 54.
The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: First, we just do the operations from left to right. 
So, 4 times 3 is 12, then we add 2 to that and get 14. 

So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, we add 2 and 5 to get 7, then we multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. Next, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3 from 28 to get 22. Finally, we add 12 to 22 to get 34.
The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication first, so 3 * 2 equals 6. Then we add 5 to that, which equals 11.  
So the answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication, so 2 times 4 equals 8. Then we add 5 to 8. So the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: First, we multiply 7 and 2 together to get 14. Then, we multiply 8 and 5 together to get 40. After that, we add 14 and 40 together to get the final answer. 
The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication, so 4 * 3 equals 12. Then you add 2 to 12. So the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, we should do the operations inside the parentheses. So, 2 + 5 equals 7. Now we have 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. Then we do the multiplication. 4 * 7 equals 28, and 2 * 3 equals 6. So now we have 28 + 12 - 6. Lastly, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right. 28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 6 equals 34. 

The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication, so 3 * 2 equals 6. Then we add 5 to 6. So the answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: First, I add 5 and 2 together to get 7. Then I multiply 7 by 4 to get 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: First, we multiply 7 and 2 to get 14. Then we multiply 8 and 5 to get 40. Finally, we add 14 and 40 to get 54. 
The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: First, I multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then I add 2 to 12 to get 14. So the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses. 2 + 5 equals 7. Then we multiply 4 with 7, which equals 28. Next, we add 12 to 28, which equals 40. Then, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which is 6, from 40. 

The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: First, I add 5 and 3 together to get 8. Then I multiply 8 by 2 to get 16.
