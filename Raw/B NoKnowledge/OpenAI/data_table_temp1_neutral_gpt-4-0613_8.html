      <td>GPT Response: First, I will add the numbers inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5 to get 7. Then I will proceed with the multiplication. So 4 times 7 equals 28. After that, I will subtract 2 times 3 equals 6 from the previous answer, so 28 - 6 equals 22. Lastly, I will add 12 to 22, so this equals 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I can add 2 plus 5, which is 7. Then, I can multiply that 7 by 4 which is 28. After that, I can add the 28 to 12 and get 40. Then I multiply 2 with 3 and get 6. Finally, I would subtract the 6 I got from the 40, which would give me 34. So my solution is:<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Sure! So first, I need to add what is inside the parentheses: 2+5 which is equal to 7. <br><br>The equation now looks like: 4*7+12-2*3. <br><br>Next, I'll do 4*7 which equals 28 and the equation looks like this now: 28+12-2*3. <br><br>Then I'll do the multiplication part there which is 2*3 equals 6.<br><br>So the equation looks like this: 28+12-6. <br><br>Then I add 28+12 which equals 40. Now the equation looks like 40-6.<br><br>Lastly, I subtract 40-6 and that equals 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
