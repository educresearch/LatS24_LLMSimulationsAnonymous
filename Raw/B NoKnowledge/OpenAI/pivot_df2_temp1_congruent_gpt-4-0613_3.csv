gpt-4-0613,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Well, I don't know about order of operations, so I would just start from the left side and go to the right to solve this problem. 

First, I have 4 times 2, which is 8. Then I add 5 to that, so now I've got 13. Then I add 12 to that, which gives me 25. Finally, I subtract 2 times 3, which is 6, so I end up with 25 minus 6 which is 19.

The answer is 19.","GPT Response: First, I'll just do the operations from left to right. So, starting with 4*(2 + 5), that's the same as 4*7 which is 28. Then, I'll go to the next part 28 + 12, which is 40. Finally, I'll do 40 - 2*3 which is the same as 40 - 6. So, the answer is 34. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Since I don't know the order of operations, I would simply calculate from left to right.

First, I would add 2 to 5, getting 7. Then, I would multiply 4 by 7, getting 28. 

After this, I would add 12, getting 40, and then, I would subtract 2, getting 38. 

Lastly, I would multiply 38 by 3, getting 114.

So, under the assumption of carrying out operations from left to right, I get 114. 

The answer is 114.","GPT Response: First, let's add 2 and 5 which gives 7. Then multiply 4 by 7, which is 28. After that, let's subtract 2 from 12, which is 10. Then finally, multiply 2 by 3, which is 6.

The answer is 28 + 10 - 6 = 32."
gpt-4-0613,1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Since I do not know about the order of operations, I'll just solve the operations in the way they appear.
First, I'll solve 4*3, which is 12. Then I'll add the 2 to it.
So, 12 plus 2 is equal to 14.
The answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, first, I will multiply 4 and 3 which equals 12. After that, I will add 2 to 12 giving me 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Well, I usually do my math from left to right, just like when I read a book. So first, I would multiply 4 times 3 to get 12. Then I would add 2 to that 12 to get 14. So, my answer would be 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Well, first I'll add 3 + 2 because that's how I see them in order. That equals 5. After that, I'll multiply 4 by 5 because the problem tells me to. 4 times 5 is 20.

The answer is 20."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Since I do not know about the order of operations, I'll just solve the operations in the way they appear.
First, I'll solve 5 + 2 which is 7.
Then, I'll multiply the 7 I got with 4, which is 28. 

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I honestly don't know much about this 'PEMDAS' or order of operations thing. But let me try to solve this problem. It says 5 + 2*4. So, I'll just do the operations from left to right. 

First, I have 5 + 2 which gives me 7. Then I multiply this 7 by 4, I get 28.

Therefore, the answer is 28.","GPT Response: Well, I usually do my math from left to right, just like when I'm reading. So, first, I would add 5 + 2 to get 7. Then, I'd multiply that 7 by 4 which gives me 28. 

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Well, I see numbers and a plus sign and a times sign. I don't really know which one I should do first so I'll just do them as I see them from left to right. So first I'll do 5 + 2, which equals 7. Then I'll multiply 7 by 4, which equals 28. So, my answer is 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Since I do not know about the order of operations, I'll just solve the operations in the way they appear.
First, I'll solve 5 + 3 which is 8.
Then, I'll multiply the 8 I got with 2, which is 16. 

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: As a grade 6 student, I honestly don't know much about this 'PEMDAS' or order of operations thing. But let me try to solve this problem. It says 5 + 3*2. So, I'll just do the operations from left to right. 

First, I have 5 + 3 which gives me 8. Then I multiply this 8 by 2, I get 16.

Therefore, the answer is 16.","GPT Response: Well, I usually do my math from left to right, just like when I read a book. So first, I would add 5 + 3 to get 8. Then, I'd multiply that 8 by 2 which gives me 16. 

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Well, I see numbers and a plus sign and a times sign. It's pretty simple right? The first thing I see is 5 plus 3, which is 8. Then, I see we need to times that 8 by 2. 8 times 2 is 16.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: First, I would multiply 7 by 2 giving me 14. Then, I would multiply 8 by 5 giving me 40. Then, I would add the 14 and the 40 together giving me 54. The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Without knowing the order of operations, I would just calculate it from left to right. 

First, 7 times 2 is 14. 

Next, 14 plus 8 is 22. 

Last, 22 times 5 is 110.

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: I'll solve this problem from left to right, just like when I read a book. Firstly, 7 times 2 is 14. Then I'll add to this the result of 8 times 5, which is 40. So, my answer comes out to be 14 plus 40 is 54. 

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, you multiply 7 by 2 which equals to 14. Next, you do 8 times 5 which equals 40. Then you add 14 and 40 together. It all adds up to 54.
The answer is 54."
