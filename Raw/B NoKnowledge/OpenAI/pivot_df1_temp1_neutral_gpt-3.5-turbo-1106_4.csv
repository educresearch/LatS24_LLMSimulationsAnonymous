gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: I don't know how to solve this problem, but I think we just solve it from left to right. So the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Um, I think you just do the operations from left to right without following any order. So first, you do 7*2 which is 14, and then 8*5 which is 40. So the final answer is 14+40 which is 54. So, the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Umm, I think I just multiply 4 and 3 first, and then add 2 to the result. So, I'll do 4 * 3 which is 12, and then add 2 which gives 14. So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Um, I don't really know how to solve this, but I think maybe I just do the operations from left to right? So first I add 2 and 5 to get 7, then I multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. Then I add 12 to get 40. After that, I subtract 2 to get 38. Finally, I multiply 2 by 3 to get 6, and then subtract 6 from 38 to get 32. So, I think the answer is 32."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Umm, I think I just solve it from left to right. So, it's 5 + 3 = 8, and then 8 * 2 = 16. So, the answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: First, we need to do the multiplication before the addition. So, we have to do 2*4 first, which equals 8. Then we can add 5 to 8. So, the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: First, I multiply 7 and 2 to get 14. Then, I multiply 8 and 5 to get 40. Finally, I add 14 and 40 to get the final answer. 
The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication which gives us 12. Then we add 2 to get 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses. 2 + 5 equals 7. 

Then, we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. 

Next, we do the operations with no parentheses, which are addition and subtraction from left to right. 

28 plus 12 equals 40. 

Finally, we subtract 2 times 3, which equals 6. 

So the final answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Ok, so first I need to do the multiplication first before adding. So, 3*2 equals 6. Then I just add 5 to that. So the answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication, so 2*4 equals 8. Then you add 5 to 8. So, the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: First, you do the math for 7 times 2, which is 14. Then you do the math for 8 times 5, which is 40. Then you add those together, so the answer is 14+40. 

The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: I would do the multiplication first, then the addition, so it's 12+2. The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses. 2 + 5 is 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. After that, we multiply 2 by 3 to get 6. Then we add 12 to 28 to get 40. Finally, we subtract 6 from 40 to get the final answer.

The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: First, we add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then we multiply 8 by 2 to get the final answer. 

The answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2*4,"GPT Response: First, we solve the multiplication first and then the addition. So, 2*4 equals 8. Then, we add 5 to 8. 
The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: First, I do the multiplication from left to right. So, 7 * 2 is 14, and 8 * 5 is 40. Then I add those together to get 54. 

So, the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*3+2,"GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication, and then the addition. So we do 4 * 3 to get 12, and then add 2 to get 14. The answer is 14."
