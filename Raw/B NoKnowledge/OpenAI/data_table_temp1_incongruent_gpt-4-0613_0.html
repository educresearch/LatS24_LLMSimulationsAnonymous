      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm a 6th grade student who doesn't know about PEMDAS, I may just solve the problem from left to right. <br><br>First, I'll multiply 4 and 2, that gives me 8. Then, I'll add 5 to 8 and I'll get 13. After that, I'll add 12 to 13, so I'll have 25. Finally, subtracting 2 from 25 leaves me with 23, and then I'll multiply 23 and 3 to get 69.<br><br>The answer is 69.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I will add 2 and 5 because they are in brackets to give us 7. So it will be 4 * 7+12-2 * 3. Then, I will multiply 4 and 7 to give 28 then subtract 2 and 3 to give -6. Then I will add 28 and 12 to give 40 then add 40 and -6 to give 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I will add the numbers in the brackets because I see that there's a pair of brackets in the equation. So, 2+5 is 7.<br><br>Next, I will multiply 4 by that result because there's a multiplication sign before the brackets. So, 4 multiplied by 7 is 28.<br><br>Then, I will add 12 to the final result because there's a plus sign after the brackets. So, 28 plus 12 is 40.<br><br>After that, I will subtract 2 from the final result because there's a minus sign after the first multiplication symbol. So, 40 minus 2 is 38.<br><br>Finally, I will multiply 3 by that result because there's a multiplication symbol after the minus sign. So, 38 multiplied by 3 is 114.<br><br>The answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Alright, so I don't know much about this "order of operations" thing, but I thinks we can just start from the left and go to the right. So first, we can do 4 times 2, so that's 8, then add 5, which is 13. <br><br>Then we will add that 13 to 12, which gives us 25. Lastly, we will take that 25 and subtract both 2 times 3 (which is 6). Then we got our final answer!<br><br>The answer is 19.</td>
