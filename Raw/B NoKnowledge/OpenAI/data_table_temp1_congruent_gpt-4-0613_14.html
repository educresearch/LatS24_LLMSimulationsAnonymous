      <td>GPT Response: I'll start by adding the 2 and 5 inside the parenthesis because they are together. So, 2 + 5 is 7. <br>Then, I'll multiply the 4 outside with the result, that makes it 4*7, which equals 28. <br>Now, we have "28 + 12 - 2*3".  <br>Next, I'll add up 28 and 12 to get 40 then subtract it by 2*3 which is 6. <br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
