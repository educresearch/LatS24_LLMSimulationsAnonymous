      <td>GPT Response: First, I will do the operations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.<br>Then, I will multiply 4 by the result: 4 * 7 = 28.<br>Next, I will multiply 2 by 3: 2 * 3 = 6.<br>Now, I will add and subtract in order from left to right: 28 + 12 - 6 = 34.<br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication inside the parentheses, so 4*(2+5) becomes 4*7. Then, we do the addition inside the parentheses, so 4*7 becomes 28. Next, we do the multiplication of 2*3, which becomes 6. Then, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right, so 28 + 12 - 6 becomes 34. <br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we will do the operations inside the parentheses: 4*(2 + 5) = 4*7. Then, we will do the multiplication 4*7, which is equal to 28. After that, we will do the operation of 2*3, which is equal to 6. Finally, we will perform the remaining operations in order from left to right: 28 + 12 - 6. <br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so first I do the multiplication. 7*2 is 14 and 8*5 is 40. Then I add 14 and 40 together, which is 54. So, the answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication. So, 7*2 is 14 and 8*5 is 40. Then, you add 14 and 40 together. The answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, you need to do the operations inside the multiplication symbols. Seven times two is fourteen and eight times five is forty. Now you add those results together. So, 14 plus 40 is 54. The answer is 54.</td>
