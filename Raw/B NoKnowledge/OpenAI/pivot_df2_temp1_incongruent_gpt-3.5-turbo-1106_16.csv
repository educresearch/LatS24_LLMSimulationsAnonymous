gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, I will add 2 and 5 together, which equals 7.
Then, I will multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28.
Next, I will multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6.
Finally, I will add 28, 12, and subtract 6, which equals 34.
So the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve the problem, I just need to follow the operations from left to right without considering any specific order. So, first I solve 4*(2+5) which is 28, then 28+12 is 40, then 40-2 is 38, and finally 38-2*3 is 32. So, the answer is 32.","GPT Response: First, we should do the calculations inside the parentheses. So, we add 2 and 5 to get 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. After that, we multiply 2 by 3 to get 6. Finally, we add 28 and 12 to get 40, and then we subtract 6 to get the final answer. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I just do the operations one by one from left to right without following any rules. So, I get:
4 * 7 + 12 - 6
Then, I add 4 to 7 to get 28, then subtract 6 to get 22.
So, the answer is 22."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: I don't really know how to solve this, but maybe I should just solve it from left to right. So, 4 times 3 is 12, then add 2. So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, you have to multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then, you add 2 to get the final answer. So the answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication, so we have 12+2. Then we do the addition, so the answer is 14. 
The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication, which is 4 times 3. Then we add 2 to the result. So, 4 * 3 is 12, and when we add 2 to that, we get 14.
So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5+2 * 4,GPT Response: I don't know how to do this!,"GPT Response: First, you have to do the multiplication before the addition. So, 2 * 4 equals 8. Then you simply add 5 to 8. Therefore, the answer is 13.","GPT Response: Um, I think I should just do the math from left to right. So, 5 plus 2 is 7, and then I'll multiply that by 4. That gives me 28. So, the answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication first, so 2 times 4 is 8. Then we add 5 to 8. So the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5+3 * 2,GPT Response: I don't know how to do that!,"GPT Response: First, you have to do the multiplication first before adding. So, 3 * 2 equals 6. Then you simply add 5 to 6 which equals 11.

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Um, I think you just do the math from left to right, so it's like 5+3 is 8 and then 8 times 2 is 16. So the answer is 16.","GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication first, so 3 * 2 equals 6. Then we add 5 to 6 which equals 11. 

The answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,7 * 2+8 * 5,GPT Response: I don't know how to solve this problem using order of operations.,"GPT Response: I just need to do the operations from left to right. So, 7 * 2 is 14, then add 8 to get 22. Then, multiply 22 by 5 to get 110. 
The answer is 110.","GPT Response: First, you do 7 times 2, which is 14. Then, you add 8 times 5, which is 40. So, the answer is 14 plus 40, which is 54.
The answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, I will just do the multiplication from left to right. So, 7 * 2 equals 14. And 8 * 5 equals 40. Then, I'll add those two numbers together. So, 14 + 40 equals 54. 

The answer is 54."
