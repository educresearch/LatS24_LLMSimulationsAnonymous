      <td>GPT Response: Oh, so I learned something cool in math class! It's called PEMDAS and it's like a secret code to solve problems like this. It stands for:<br><br>- P for Parentheses (stuff inside the round brackets)<br>- E for Exponents (like if there was a 2 to the power of 3 or something, but we don't have that here)<br>- MD for Multiplication and Division (from left to right)<br>- AS for Addition and Subtraction (also from left to right)<br><br>So let's break it down!<br><br>First, we do the Parentheses:<br>4 * (2+5) becomes 4 * 7 because 2 + 5 is 7.<br><br>Now our problem looks like this:<br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next is Multiplication:<br>4 * 7 is 28<br>and 2 * 3 is 6.<br><br>So after doing that, we've got:<br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Then we just have Addition and Subtraction left, which we do from left to right:<br>28 + 12 is 40<br>And then we take away 6 from 40, which gives us 34.<br><br>So, putting it all together, the answer is 34!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm a 6th grader who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I might solve the problem without following the standard rules. Nevertheless, I'll try to solve it step by step:<br><br>1. First, I'll add the numbers in the parenthesis (2+5) which gives 7.<br>2. Now the problem looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br>3. Then, I might multiply 4 by 7 because I feel that multiplication seems important. That gives 28.<br>4. My new problem is: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br>5. Now I will add 28 and 12, which gives 40.<br>6. Next, I see another multiplication: 2 times 3 is 6.<br>7. Finally, subtracting 6 from 40 gives me 34.<br><br>So without knowing the proper order of operations, my final answer might be: The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! Since I don't know what PEMDAS is, I'm going to solve this problem step by step from left to right, just like I'm reading a book! <br><br>First, I see 4 times something times something else plus 12 minus 2 times 3. So let's do it step by step.<br><br>First, I see 4 times something. 4 * 2 is 8, and then I still have to add the 5. So that's 13. So, now I think I have 13 plus 12 which is 25. But there's still that minus 2 times 3. Minus 2 is 23, and 23 times 3 is 69.<br><br>So I think the answer is 69! But oh... I don't know about any rules that might tell me to do things differently, so that's my best guess!<br><br>The answer is 69.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: So first, I know I need to do the part in the parentheses, which is (2+5). So let's add that together:<br><br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now we replace that in our problem:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Then we have to do the multiplication before we do the addition or subtraction. So let's multiply 4 times 7, and 2 times 3:<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>Now we replace those in our problem:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Then we just add and subtract from left to right. So first we add 28 and 12:<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>And then we subtract 6 from 40:<br><br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So the answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, so I learned about this! We do multiplication before addition because that's the rule. So, we first multiply 4 and 3, which is 12, and then we add 2 to it. <br><br>So it goes like this:<br><br>1. Multiply 4 by 3 to get 12.<br>2. Then, add 2 to the result, which gives us 12 + 2.<br><br>After we do the addition, we get 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who knows nothing about order of operations, I might solve this simply from left to right as I see it.<br><br>First, I multiply 4 and 3, because that's what comes first:<br>4 * 3 = 12<br><br>Then, I add the 2 to the result of that multiplication:<br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, since I don't know about the order of operations, I would probably just solve it from left to right like I'm reading a book! <br><br>First, I would take 4 times 3, which is 12. Then, I would add the 2 to that, which makes 14. <br><br>So I would say, The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! So I think we just do it in the order it's written. So first we do 4 times 3 which is 12, and then we add 2 to it, which makes 14!<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>5+2 * 4</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, so I learned about this! We're supposed to do what's inside parentheses first, but there aren't any here. Then, we do exponents, but I don't see those either. After that, it's multiplication or division, from left to right. And then, addition or subtraction, from left to right. So, for the problem 5 + 2 * 4, I need to do the multiplication part first before I add.<br><br>So, I do 2 times 4 first, which is 8.<br><br>After that, I add the 5.<br><br>So it's 5 + 8, which equals 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I might just do the operations from left to right. So, I'll start by adding 5 + 2, which gives me 7. Then I'll multiply that result by 4. <br><br>7 * 4 equals 28.<br><br>So, the answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, since I don't know about the order of operations, I would probably just solve this from left to right, like I'm reading a book. So first I would take 5 and add 2 to it because that's the first thing I see. That makes 7. Then, I'd take the 7 and multiply it by 4 because that's the next thing to do. So 7 times 4 is 28. So I think the answer is 28. <br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, this is a math problem! My teacher told me about something called "times tables" and adding numbers. So if I just do what I see, I first see a 5 plus 2 which is 7, and then there's a times 4. I know that if I have 7 things and then I get 4 times more, I can just add 7 four times like this: 7 + 7 + 7 + 7. <br><br>So that's, umm, 7 plus 7 is 14, plus another 7 is 21, and then another 7 is 28. So I think the answer should be like adding them all up.<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, so I heard from my friend that when you have a math problem with different things like multiplying and adding, there's a special way to do it. She called it "PEMDAS" or something, which stands for parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). But I don't really know how it works.<br><br>Hmm, we don't have any parentheses or exponents in this problem, so I guess we look at the multiplication first. So we do 3 times 2, which is 6. And then we add 5 to it last because my friend said addition comes after multiplication. So we do 5 plus 6 and that's 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I might just do the operations from left to right. So, I'll start by adding 5 + 3, which gives me 8. Then I'll multiply that result by 2. <br><br>So, 8 * 2 is 16.<br><br>The answer is 16.</td>
