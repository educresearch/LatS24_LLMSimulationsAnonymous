gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Um, I don't really know about these operations in Math, but I guess I'll just do them one by one. First, I'll add 2 and 5, which is 7. Then I'll multiply 4 by 7, which is 28. After that, I'll multiply 2 by 3, which is 6. Then I'll just add and subtract the numbers as they come, so 28 plus 12 is 40, and then minus 6 is 34. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: I don't know how to solve this using order of operations. Can you please explain it to me? 

The answer is 38.","GPT Response: First, I solve the numbers inside the parentheses, so 2 + 5 equals 7. Then I multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. Then I multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. Then I add 12 to 28, which equals 40. Finally, I subtract 6 from 40, and the answer is 34. 
Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I will do what is inside the parentheses: 2+5=7. Then, I will multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. After that, I will multiply 2 by 3 to get 6. Lastly, I will add and subtract the numbers. So, 28 + 12 - 6 = 34. Therefore, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Um, I think I'm supposed to do the multiplication first and then the addition. So, 4*3 is 12 and then I add 2 to that. So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, we perform the multiplication which is 4*3 and then we add the result to 2. So, 4*3 equals 12 and then we add 2 to get the final answer. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Umm, I think I just need to do the operations from left to right. So, 4*3 is 12, and then I add 2 to that. So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: So, first we have to do the multiplication, which is 4 times 3, and then we add 2 to the result. 
4 times 3 equals 12, and then we add 2, which equals 14. 
So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Um, I think I just need to do the operations from left to right. So, 5 + 2 is 7 and then I multiply that by 4 to get 28. 
The answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication which is 2*4 and then we add the 5. 

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: Umm, I think I just need to do the operations from left to right. So, 5 + 2 is 7 and then I multiply that by 4 to get 28. 
The answer is 28.","GPT Response: So, first I have to do the multiplication, which is 2 times 4, and then add the result to 5. So, 2 times 4 is 8. And then I add 8 to 5, which is 13. 

The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Umm, I'm not sure, but I think you just do the operations from left to right. So, 5 + 3 is 8, and then you multiply that by 2, which gives you 16.

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: First, we perform the multiplication.
So 3*2 equals 6.
Then we add 5 to 6.
So the answer is 11.","GPT Response: Umm, I think I just need to do the operations from left to right. So, 5 + 3 is 8, and then 8 times 2 is 16. So, the answer is 16.","GPT Response: So, first I have to add 5 and 3, which is 8. Then I have to multiply 8 by 2, which is 16. So the answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: First, I will just do the operations from left to right. 
7*2 = 14
14 + 8*5 = 14 + 40
So, the answer is 54.","GPT Response: I will just do the operations from left to right. So, I will first do 7*2 which is 14, and then I will do 8*5 which is 40. So the final answer is 14 + 40 = 54. 

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Umm, I'm not really sure, but I think you just do the operations from left to right. So it's like 7*2 = 14, and then 14 + 8*5 = 14 + 40, which is 54. So the answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, we just do the operations from left to right. So, 7*2 equals 14, and then we add 8*5, which equals 40. So, the final answer is 14 + 40 = 54.
Therefore, the answer is 54."
