      <td>GPT Response: First, we start with the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5, which equals 7. Now the problem becomes 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. <br><br>Next, we calculate the multiplication. 4 * 7 equals 28, and 2 * 3 equals 6. Now the problem is 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Finally, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right. 28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 6 equals 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS). <br><br>First, we start with the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5, which equals 7. <br><br>Next, we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. <br><br>Then, we have 12 - 2. <br><br>Finally, we multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. <br><br>So, we have 28 + 12 - 6. <br><br>To get the final answer, we add 28 and 12, which equals 40. Then, we subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we need to start with the numbers inside the parentheses. In this case, we have 2 + 5, which is 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. <br><br>Next, we have 12 - 2*3. We need to multiply 2 by 3, which gives us 6. Then, we subtract 6 from 12 to get 6. <br><br>Finally, we add the results of the two calculations together. 28 + 6 equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: So, we have to solve this problem step by step. First, we have to work inside the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5, which is equal to 7. <br><br>Then, we have to multiply 4 by the result inside the parentheses, which is 4 * 7.<br><br>Next, we add 12 to the product we just found, which is 4 * 7 + 12.<br><br>After that, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3 from our previous result, which is 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Finally, we perform the multiplication and the addition from left to right. <br><br>So, 4 * 7 is 28, and 28 + 12 is 40. <br><br>Now, we have to do the multiplication 2 * 3, which is equal to 6.<br><br>Finally, we subtract 6 from 40. <br><br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
