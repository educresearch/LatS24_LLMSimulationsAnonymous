      <td>GPT Response: Gosh, order of operations sounds tricky, but I think my math teacher mentioned something about how we should do calculations in a certain way. Here's what I remember:<br><br>1. We have to do what's inside the parentheses first.<br>2. Then we do multiplication or division as we find them from left to right.<br>3. Last, we do addition and subtraction from left to right.<br><br>Okay, so looking at this math problem:<br><br>4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>I should start with the parentheses:<br><br>(2+5) equals 7, so the problem becomes:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I should do the multiplication:<br><br>4 * 7 is 28 and 2 * 3 is 6, so now our problem looks like this:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Then, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:<br><br>28 + 12 is 40 and then 40 - 6 is 34.<br><br>So, the final answer should be:<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Alright, let's solve the math problem step by step.<br><br>First, we need to follow the order of operations, which I remember by saying "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally" or PEMDAS. This stands for:<br><br>P – Parentheses first<br>E – Exponents (like powers and square roots, etc.)<br>MD – Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)<br>AS – Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)<br><br>So using PEMDAS, let's solve the problem:<br><br>4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>First step, do what's inside the parentheses:<br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now, we replace that in the equation:<br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next step is multiplication:<br>4 * 7 = 28<br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>Replace those into the equation:<br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Now, we move to addition and subtraction, from left to right:<br>28 + 12 = 40<br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So, the final answer is:<br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I'm not really sure how to do this with special rules, but I can try to figure it out step by step!<br><br>First I see there's a part with brackets: (2+5). I think I should add those numbers together first! So, 2 + 5 equals 7.<br><br>Then, I think I just go from left to right because that's how I read!<br><br>So I'm going to take that 7 and multiply it by 4 because that was next. So, 4 times 7 is 28.<br><br>After that, I see a plus, so I'm going to add 12 to 28. That's 40!<br><br>Then I keep going and see I have to subtract 2. So I take 40 minus 2 and I get 38.<br><br>And lastly, there's another multiply by 3. So I take 38 times 3 which is... hmm, tough one, but 38 added 3 times is 38 + 38 + 38, which is 76 plus 38, and that's 114!<br><br>So if I do it this way, the answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: So, we're going to solve this step by step together! We need to remember to do the things in parentheses first, that's like the first rule I learned.<br><br>Inside the parentheses we have 2 + 5. So let's add those together first. 2 plus 5 equals 7. Now we can rewrite the problem replacing the (2+5) with 7. So it looks like this now:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I think we need to do the multiplication parts before we do addition or subtraction. So let's multiply 4 times 7. That gives us 28. And 2 times 3 is 6, right? So now our problem looks like this:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Now we just add and subtract from left to right. So first we add 28 and 12. That gives us 40. Okay, now we take that 40 and subtract 6.<br><br>40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>So after doing all those steps, the final answer should be:<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about order of operations yet, I might just do the operations from left to right as I see them. So, I would first multiply 4 by 3, because that's the first thing I see, and that gives me 12. Then I would add 2 to that result, because that comes next.<br><br>4 * 3 = 12<br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>So, I would say, the answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, even though I don't know the order of operations named PEMDAS, it makes sense to me to first do the multiplication part because it feels like a stronger operation than addition. So, first I'd multiply 4 and 3 together, which is 12. Then I'd add 2 to that result. <br><br>So, 12 plus 2 is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm just learning about numbers and adding and multiplying. When I see this problem, I think I should just solve it from left to right, like I read! So first I would multiply 4 and 3 because that comes first. That makes 12. And then I add the 2. So 12 plus 2 is 14!<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Um, so I think I just do the math from left to right like reading a book. So first I see 4 times 3 which is 12, and then I just add 2 to that, so 12 plus 2 is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about order of operations yet, I might just do the operations from left to right as I see them. So I would add 5 and 2 first to get 7, and then multiply that by 4. Here's how I would do it:<br><br>5 + 2 = 7<br>Then I would take the 7 and multiply it by 4:<br>7 * 4 = 28<br><br>So, doing it this way without knowing the proper order, I would say:<br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about order of operations (PEMDAS), I might just solve this from left to right. So first I'd do the addition, which is 5 + 2, which equals 7. And then I would do the multiplication, which is 7 * 4, which equals 28.<br><br>However, I think it's important to note that usually in math, multiplication comes before addition, so the "real" way to do it would be to multiply 2 * 4 first, which is 8, and then add that to 5, which gives 13. Even though I don't know about order of operations, it's good to be aware that there's a usual way to solve problems like this.<br><br>But since I'm supposed to not know about PEMDAS, if I just did it in the order it's written without that knowledge, I would have said:<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, since I'm an elementary school student and I don't know about order of operations, I might just solve this from left to right, like I read a book! So, I'll add 5 plus 2 first, which is 7, and then I'll multiply it by 4. So, 7 times 4 equals 28. <br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Um, so I think I just do the adding and the multiplying in the order they show up. So first I go 5 + 2 which is 7, and then it says to multiply by 4, so I do 7 * 4 which is 28.<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Umm, I'm not sure what you mean by 'order of operations', but when I look at this, I think I should probably do the multiplication part first because I remember my teacher saying something about "multiplication before addition." So that means I should do 3 times 2 first, which is 6. <br><br>Then I would add the 5 to that, so 5 plus 6, which is 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: In math, we have a special rule that tells us which order to do things in. It's like when you get dressed, you can't put on your shoes before your socks, right? There's an order to how things should be done. When we do calculations, there's an order too, so we don't get mixed up. This rule is called "order of operations." <br><br>The order goes like this:<br><br>1. Parentheses (anything inside brackets)<br>2. Exponents (like when you have a number to the power of another number)<br>3. Multiplication and Division (which come left to right)<br>4. Addition and Subtraction (also from left to right)<br><br>Now, for our problem, 5 + 3 * 2, we have to do the multiplication part before the addition because multiplication comes before addition in our list. So we first multiply 3 by 2.<br><br>3 * 2 = 6<br><br>Then we add that result to 5.<br><br>5 + 6 = 11<br><br>So, the answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think I just do it from left to right like when I read a book! So first, I add 5 and 3 together because that comes first. That makes 8. And then I multiply 8 by 2 because that comes next. So 8 times 2 is 16. <br><br>The answer is 16.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Um, so I think I just do the adding then the multiplying. So first I do 5 plus 3 which is 8. Then I multiply 8 by 2 which is 16. So, I think the answer is 16. <br><br>The answer is 16.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I haven't learned about the order of operations in school yet, but I think you have to do something with the multiplication first and then add the results. So, I would multiply 7 by 2, which is 14, and then I would multiply 8 by 5, which is 40. After that, I think you add them together, so 14 plus 40 equals 54.<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I don't know what PEMDAS is because I'm only in grade 6 and haven't learned it yet. But I guess I can still try to solve this math problem! <br><br>So what I know is that we usually do multiplying before adding. That means I have to multiply 7 by 2 first, and then multiply 8 by 5.<br><br>So, 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40.<br><br>After I have these two numbers, I can add them together.<br><br>So, 14 plus 40 equals 54.<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
