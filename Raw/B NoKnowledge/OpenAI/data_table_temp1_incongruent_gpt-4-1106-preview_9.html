      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I remember my teacher talking about this "PEMDAS" thing which is a way to solve math problems like this one. It stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>So first, I'll do the part in the parentheses:<br><br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now I rewrite the problem with this answer:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next is multiplication and division, from left to right. So I'll multiply 4 times 7 and 2 times 3:<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>Then I put those answers back into the problem:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Last step is addition and subtraction, from left to right:<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So the final answer is:<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, let's solve this step by step. I remember my teacher talking about something like we need to do the things inside the parenthesis first. So let's do that:<br><br>First, we have (2+5). So we add those numbers together:<br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now we replace that back into the problem:<br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I think we do the multiplying before we do any adding or subtracting. So we have two multiplications here: 4 * 7 and 2 * 3.<br>Let's do those:<br>4 * 7 = 28<br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>Now we'll put those back into the problem:<br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Now we just have addition and subtraction left. I think I can do this in order from left to right:<br>28 + 12 = 40<br>Now subtract 6:<br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So, putting it all together:<br>4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3 equals 34<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, I think I just do the things in order from left to right, like I read a book! So first, I see 4 times something. But there's this little 2+5 inside brackets, so I'll add those first because it's like it's in its own little bubble. That's 7!<br><br>So it's 4 times 7 now, and that gives me 28. Then I just keep going to the right. Next is plus 12, so 28 plus 12 is 40.<br><br>After that, it's minus 2 times 3. I'll just go in order, so 40 minus 2 is 38; and then 38 times 3... oh wait, this seems tricky, but I think it's just 38 times 3 equals 114.<br><br>So, my answer is, The answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: So first, I know that you have to do what's inside the parentheses before you do anything else. Inside the parentheses we got 2 + 5, which is like having 2 apples and then getting 5 more apples, which means you have 7 apples. So that part becomes 4 * 7 because you replace the 2+5 with a 7.<br><br>Then it's kind of like you have 4 bags and each bag has 7 apples, and if you put all those apples together, you'd have 28 apples because 4 times 7 is 28. <br><br>After that, you have to finish the rest of the problem. So it's 28 (because we figured out 4 * 7) plus 12, which is like if you have 28 apples and you get 12 more, then you have 40 apples.<br><br>Now you have to subtract the last part, which is 2 times 3. Like if you have 2 groups of 3 apples, that's 6 apples. So now the math problem is like you have 40 apples and then you give away 6 apples, so you're left with 34 apples.<br><br>So the whole thing is 4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3, and after you do the adding and multiplying and then the subtracting, the answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: If I don't know about the order of operations, I might solve the problem from left to right, just like I read a sentence.<br><br>First, I would do the multiplication because that's the first thing I see:<br>4 times 3 equals 12.<br><br>Then I would add the 2:<br>12 plus 2 equals 14.<br><br>So, my answer would be:<br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: When I look at this math problem, I see that we have multiplication and addition. I remember my teacher talking about a rule we need to follow so that everyone gets the same answer. The rule was something like "do the 'times' before the 'plus'." This means I should multiply 4 * 3 first, before I add 2.<br><br>So let's do that step by step:<br><br>First, I'm going to multiply 4 by 3, which gives me 12.<br>4 * 3 = 12<br><br>Now, I have this left:<br>12 + 2<br><br>Next, I'll add 2 to 12:<br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>So, after doing the multiplication first and then the addition, the final answer is:<br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! So I think we just go from left to right like we read a book. First, I see 4 times 3, which I know is 12 because 4 groups of 3 is 12. Then we have to add 2. So if I have 12 and get 2 more, that makes 14. So my answer is:<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm going to solve the problem step by step, just like my teacher showed us. First I see a 4 and a 3 with a multiplication sign between them. My teacher said that we do multiplication first. So, 4 times 3 is 12. <br><br>Now, we have 12 plus 2. I know that I just have to add these two numbers together. So, 12 plus 2 is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: If I'm a grade 6 student who knows nothing about order of operations, I might think I should just solve the math problem from left to right, like reading a book!<br><br>So I would start with the 5 plus 2, which makes 7, and then multiply that by 4. So:<br><br>5 + 2 = 7<br>7 * 4 = 28<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: When you have a math problem with different operations like addition and multiplication, you have to follow a certain order to solve it. In this case, you need to do the multiplication part before the addition.<br><br>So first, you multiply 2 with 4:<br><br>2 * 4 = 8<br><br>After that, you add the result to 5:<br><br>5 + 8 = 13<br><br>So the answer to the problem is 13. <br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! So I don't know about this PEMDAS thing because we haven't learned it yet in school. But I think I know that when you see numbers and plus signs and multiplication stuff, you can just do it from left to right like reading a book.<br><br>So I would just start with 5 plus 2, because that's what comes first. That's 7, right? Then there's this multiplication part with 7 times 4. Multiplying is like adding something a bunch of times, so that would be like adding 7 four times. If I do that, it's like 7 plus 7 plus 7 plus 7, and that gets a bit hard to do in my head...<br><br>But let's see, 7 plus 7 is 14, and then another 7 plus 7 is another 14, so if I put the two 14s together, that's 28!<br><br>So doing it the way I think makes sense, I guess the answer is 28. The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: When you have multiplication and addition, my teacher says I should do the multiplication part first before I add. So I'm going to multiply 2 and 4 first, which is 8. After that, I'll add the 5.<br><br>So it's like this:<br><br>2 * 4 is 8.<br><br>Then I take the 8 and add it to 5.<br><br>5 + 8 is 13.<br><br>So the answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: When you have a math problem with different operations like addition (+) and multiplication (*), you need to know which one to do first. The rule to remember is that you must do multiplication before addition. This rule is actually part of something bigger called "order of operations," but for this problem, we just need to know the multiplication part comes first.<br><br>So, in the problem 5 + 3 * 2, you would first do the multiplication part:<br><br>3 * 2 = 6<br><br>Once you have that, you add it to the 5:<br><br>5 + 6 = 11<br><br>So the final answer is:<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: When I do math problems, my teacher told me I have to do some things before others. She said we have to do multiplication before addition. So, if I look at 5 + 3 * 2, I have to do the 3 * 2 part first.<br><br>So, 3 times 2 is 6.<br><br>Now I just have to add that 6 to the 5.<br><br>So, 5 + 6 is 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm a grade 6 student and don't know about order of operations yet, I might just solve this from left to right.

      <td>GPT Response: Oh! I think we just do the math left to right like reading a book. So first, we multiply 7 by 2 which is 14. Then we add 8 to get 22. And last, we multiply that 22 by 5. Let's grab a calculator for that... 22 times 5 is 110.<br><br>The answer is 110.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve the problem, we need to do the multiplications first and then add the results together. So first I'll multiply 7 by 2, which gives us 14.
