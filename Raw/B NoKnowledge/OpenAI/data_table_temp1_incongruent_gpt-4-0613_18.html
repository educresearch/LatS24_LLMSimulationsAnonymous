      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know the concept of order of operations, I'd go ahead to solve this problem from left to right.<br><br>Starting from the left, I multiply 4 with everything in the bracket, (2+5), which gives 28.<br><br>Next, I'd add the 12 to the 28, which gives 40.<br><br>Then, I'll move to the right and subtract 2 from 40 which gives 38.<br><br>Finally, I multiply 38 by 3, which gives 114.<br><br>So, the answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I will add 2 and 5 together because they're inside brackets. So, 2+5 is 7.<br><br>Then, I will multiply the result with 4. 4 * 7 is 28.<br><br>I also need to multiply 2 and 3. So, 2*3 is 6.<br><br>Now, I can use these results to add and subtract. I'll add 28 and 12 to get 40. Then I will subtract 6 from 40 which gives me 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, since I don't know about the order of operations, I'd go ahead and solve this from left to right just like a normal reading. First, I'll add 2 and 5 to get 7, then I'll multiply 4 by that to get 28. After that, I'll add 12 to get a total of 40. Finally, I'll subtract 2 and multiply the answer by 3 to get a final result of 114.<br><br>The answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, you add 2 and 5 because it's inside the parentheses, so that means you do it first. You get 7. Then, you multiply 4 and 7 because in the problem, you do the multiplication before you do anything else. That gives you 28. After that, you add 12 to 28 which is 40. Finally, you subtract 2 times 3, which is 6, from 40. So the final answer is 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
