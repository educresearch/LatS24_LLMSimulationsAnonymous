      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure, but I think I might do the problem like this. I'll just go from left to right:<br><br>First, 4 times 2 is 8. I add 5 to that, I get 13. <br><br>Then, I add 12 to 13, which is 25. <br><br>And then, 2 times 3 is 6. I subtract 6 from 25, I get 19. <br><br>The answer is 19.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First I'll add the numbers inside the parenthesis (2+5), then I'll multiply the result by 4.<br>Then, I'll subtract 2*3 from 12.<br>Lastly, I'll add the two results together. Here's how it goes:<br><br>First, (2+5) = 7.<br>Then, 4*7 = 28.<br>After that, 12 - 2*3 = 12 - 6 = 6.<br>And the final answer is 28 + 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, first I will add 2 and 5 because they are in brackets. That gives me 7. Then, I will multiply that 7 with 4 because it's right next to the brackets. That gives me 28. <br><br>Next, I see a plus sign and the number 12, so I will add that to 28. That gives me 40. <br><br>After that, I see a minus sign and then 2 times 3. Multiplication is just adding the same number many times, so 2 times 3 is 6.<br><br>Finally, I subtract that 6 from the 40. So, my final answer would be 34. The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I will add 2 and 5 which equals 7. Then, I will multiply the result by 4. After that, I will subtract 2*3 from 12 which is 12 - 6. I'll then add these two results together.<br><br>Step 1: 2 + 5 = 7<br>Step 2: 7 * 4 = 28<br>Step 3: 12 - 2*3 = 12 - 6 = 6<br>Step 4: 28 + 6 = 34<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

Multiplying 4 by 3 gives me 12. <br><br>Next, it says to add 2 to the result of that multiplication, which is 12.<br><br>So when we add 2 to 12, we get 14. <br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I would multiply 4 by 3 because it's the first operation, so it gives 12. Next, I see a plus sign followed by 2, so I would add 2 to 12. So, my solution for this would be: <br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
