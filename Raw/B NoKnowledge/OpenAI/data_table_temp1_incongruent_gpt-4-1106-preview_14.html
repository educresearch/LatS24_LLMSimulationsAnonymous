      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I'm not really sure about the special rules but I think I have to do something with the numbers in the brackets first. So, if I look at the problem, there's a 2 plus 5 inside brackets. I'll add those together because that's what brackets usually mean, right?<br><br>2 + 5 equals 7.<br><br>Now the problem looks like this:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>I think I should just solve it from left to right like reading a book. So I'll multiply 4 and 7 first because that comes next.<br><br>4 * 7 equals 28.<br><br>Then we add 12 to that, right?<br><br>28 + 12 equals 40.<br><br>Then it says to subtract 2 times 3, but I'll do the 2 times 3 part first because it's like the brackets thing.<br><br>2 * 3 equals 6.<br><br>So now, we need to subtract 6 from 40.<br><br>40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>So I think the answer is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, since I'm just learning this, I'll try to solve the problem step by step. First, I do what's inside the parentheses because that's what my teacher said to do first.<br><br>So (2 + 5) equals 7. Now the problem looks like this:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Then I think I'm supposed to do the multiplication before the addition and subtraction. So I'll multiply 4 times 7 which is 28, and then 2 times 3 which is 6. Now the problem is:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Now I'll just go left to right doing the addition and then the subtraction. So 28 plus 12 is 40, and 40 minus 6 is 34.<br><br>So the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, since I don't know about the order of operations, I might just work from left to right, like I'm reading a book. So, I'll start with the first number and operation I see.<br><br>First, I would do 4 times 2 which is 8.<br><br>Then I see there is a plus and a 5, so I would add 5 to 8 which is 13.<br><br>Then I would multiply that by 4 because I think that all the multiplication happens at the same time. So, 13 times 4 is 52.<br><br>Now I add 12 to 52 which is 64.<br><br>Then I would subtract 2, so that would give me 62.<br><br>And finally, I'd multiply by 3. So, 62 times 3 is 186.<br><br>So, I would say the answer is 186.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so let's work this out! First, we need to do what's inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5. That equals 7. Then, we multiply that number by 4 because it's right outside the parentheses. So 4 times 7 is 28.<br><br>Then we have to add 12 to that, so 28 + 12 is 40.<br><br>Lastly, we need to subtract the product of 2 and 3 from that total. Multiplying 2 by 3 is 6. So we take our 40 and subtract 6, and that leaves us with 34.<br><br>So the final answer is 34!</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Since I haven't learned about the order of operations (PEMDAS) yet, I might just solve the problem from left to right.<br><br>So, I would first multiply 4 by 3, which is 12. <br>Then, I would add the 2 to that result. <br><br>So, 12 + 2 equals 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
