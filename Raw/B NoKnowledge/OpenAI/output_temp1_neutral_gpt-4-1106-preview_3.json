So first I have to do 4 times 3, which is 12, and then I add 2 to that. So 12 plus 2 is 14. \n\nThe answer is 14."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400", "model": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 400, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in elementary school who knows nothing about order of operations in Mathematics.\n                    Answer the Mathematics question using this given persona and nothing else.\n                    Explain your solution (concise!) to this given Mathematics problem (using the above persona given), and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "4*(2+5)+12-2*3"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: Well, I know that in math problems, you usually have to do things in a special order.
