The order of operations tells us that we should do the operations inside parentheses first, then multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right. 

Let's break down the problem step by step:

First, we have 4*(2+5). Inside the parentheses, we have 2+5 which equals 7. So, 4*(2+5) becomes 4*7, which is 28.

Next, we have 28+12-2*3. We need to do the multiplication first. 2*3 equals 6. 

Now, we have 28+12-6. Addition and subtraction are done from left to right, so we start with 28+12, which equals 40.

Finally, we have 40-6. Subtracting 6 from 40 gives us 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: First, we need to solve what's inside of the parentheses. This means we add 2 and 5 together, which gives us 7. 

Next, we multiply 4 by 7, which gives us 28. 

Now, we add 12 to 28, which gives us 40. 

Finally, we subtract 2 times 3, which is 6, from 40. 

So, the answer is 34."

I don't know which one to do first because I don't know about order of operations. So I will just do the operations in the order that they appear from left to right. Starting with the addition, I add 5 and 3 together which equals 8. Then, I multiply 8 by 2 to get 16. 

So the final answer is 16."
