      <td>GPT Response: First, I don't know anything about order of operations. But my teacher told me to do the calculations from left to right, so I'll do that. <br>4 * (2 + 5) equals 28. Then I add 12, which equals 40. And finally, I subtract 2 * 3, which equals 34. <br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I do the math inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 is 7.<br>Then I multiply 4 by 7 to get 28.<br>Next, I multiply 2 by 3 to get 6.<br>Finally, I add, subtract from left to right, so 28 + 12 is 40, and then subtract 6 to get 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I need to solve the operations inside the parentheses. So 2 + 5 equals 7. Then I do the multiplication first, so 4 times 7 equals 28. Then I do the multiplication again, so 2 times 3 equals 6. Then I just need to do the addition and subtraction from left to right, so 28 plus 12 equals 40, and then 40 minus 6 equals 34. <br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
