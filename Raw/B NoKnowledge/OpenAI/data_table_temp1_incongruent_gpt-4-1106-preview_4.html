      <td>GPT Response: Since I just learned about order of operations, let's try to solve this together using the PEMDAS rule. PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). Here's how we apply it to the problem:<br><br>First, solve the expression inside the parentheses:<br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now, let's look at the multiplication and division parts from left to right:<br>4 * 7 = 28<br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>Now we'll rewrite the expression with those results:<br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Next, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:<br>28 + 12 = 40<br>And then,<br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>Hence, we did the operations in the right order: parentheses, then multiplication, and finally the addition and subtraction.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm a grade 6 student who doesn't know about order of operations, I would try to solve the problem step by step, based on what seems right to me without the formal rules:<br><br>First, I see parentheses, so I think I should do that part first:<br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Then, I replace 2+5 with 7 in the expression:<br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I'll just go from left to right because I don't know about any other rules.<br>First, I will multiply 4 and 7 because that comes before the addition and subtraction in the expression:<br>4 * 7 = 28<br><br>So now my expression looks like this:<br>28 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I will add 28 and 12:<br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>Now the expression is:<br>40 - 2 * 3<br><br>And, going left to right again, I'll subtract 2 from 40:<br>40 - 2 = 38<br><br>Finally, I’ll multiply 38 by 3 (even though this might not feel entirely right, I'm using my intuition):<br>38 * 3 = 114<br><br>But I don't think this result is accurate because I'm a bit confused. If I learn the proper way to do it, I'm sure I'd get a different answer. <br><br>The answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, this looks like a puzzle with numbers! I think you just do things one at a time from left to right, like reading a book. So first, I would multiply 4 by 2, which is 8, then add 5 to get 13. Then I would add 12 to that to get 25. After that, I would subtract 2 times 3 which is 6 from 25. So, let's do it step by step:<br><br>1. 4 times 2 is 8.<br>2. Add 5, that makes it 13.<br>3. Add 12, that's 25.<br>4. 2 times 3 is 6.<br>5. Subtract 6 from 25, and that gives you 19.<br><br>So I think the answer is 19!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! So, to do this math problem, I need to remember what my teacher said about "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally" or PEMDAS. It means we do the math in this order: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>So let's do it step by step:<br><br>1. Do what's in the parentheses first: (2+5) which equals 7.<br>2. Now we do the multiplication and division from left to right:<br>   - First, multiply 4 times what we got in the parentheses, 4 * 7, which is 28.<br>   - Then, at the end we have to multiply 2 * 3, which is 6.<br>3. Lastly, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:<br>   - So, take the 28 we got from step 2, and then we need to add 12, which gives us 40.<br>   - Then, we subtract the 6 we got from the last multiplication in step 2, which gives us 34.<br><br>If we put it all together we have: 28 (from the 4 * 7) + 12 - 6 (from the 2 * 3) = 34.<br><br>So the answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, so I'm not sure about something called order of operations, but I think we just solve this from left to right, like reading a book! So, I'll multiply 4 and 3 first because that comes before the addition. Alright, let's see...<br><br>4 times 3 is 12, and then it says to add 2, so I'll just add 2 to 12.<br><br>12 plus 2 is 14!<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve the math problem "4 * 3+2," I will do the multiplication part first and then the addition, because my teacher says that's usually how we should do it.<br><br>First, I'll multiply 4 by 3:<br>4 * 3 = 12<br><br>After that, I'll add 2 to the result:<br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>So, the final answer to the problem is "The answer is 14."</td>
      <td>GPT Response: If we're just adding and multiplying numbers without knowing any specific rules, I might just do this from left to right like I read a book! So first I will multiply 4 and 3 because that's the first thing I see.<br><br>4 times 3 is 12.<br><br>And then I'll add 2 to that, because that's the next thing I see!<br><br>So 12 plus 2 is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: You do the multiplication first and then the addition second, according to the order of operations I learned at school.<br><br>First do the multiplication:<br>4 times 3 equals 12<br><br>Next do the addition:<br>12 plus 2 equals 14<br><br>So the final answer is:<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, so I'm not sure about this "PEMDAS" thing, but I think we should do the multiplication part first because that’s what my brother does. So if we take 2 times 4, that gives us 8. Then after that, we need to add the 5. So we do 5 plus 8, which is 13. So, if I did this right, the answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think my teacher said something about this. We have to do some things before others. Multiplication comes before addition. So first, we have to multiply 2 and 4, and then add 5 to the result.<br><br>Let's do the multiplication first:<br>2 times 4 equals 8<br><br>Now we add 5:<br>5 plus 8 equals 13<br><br>So, the answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, since I haven't learned about any rules for the order of doing things in math yet, I would just solve the problem from left to right. So first, I would add 5 and 2 together to get 7, and then I would multiply that by 4.<br><br>Let me do that really quick:<br><br>7 (that's 5 + 2) times 4 equals 28.<br><br>So, I think the answer is 28. <br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: So, um, when you have to add and multiply things, it's like when you have to put your socks on before your shoes. You have to do some things before others. I think my teacher said that you have to do the times part before you do the plus part. So I'll do the times part first!<br><br>The times part is 2 times 4, which is 8. So now I have 5 plus 8. That's like if I have 5 candies and then get 8 more. So then I have 13 candies!<br><br>So, the answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: To solve the math problem 5 + 3 * 2, even though I don't know about the order of operations called PEMDAS, I can still try to work it out step by step.<br><br>First, I see that there is a multiplication part (3 * 2) and an addition part (5 + something).

      <td>GPT Response: Well, to solve this problem, I think we should just work from left to right since that seems fair.
