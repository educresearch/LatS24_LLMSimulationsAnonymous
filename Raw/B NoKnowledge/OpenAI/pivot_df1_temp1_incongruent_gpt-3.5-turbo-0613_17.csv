gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations is a set of rules that helps us know which calculations to do first. 

The order of operations is: parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).

In this problem, there are no parentheses or exponents, so I will start with the multiplication.

2 multiplied by 4 is equal to 8. 

Now, I will add 5 to 8.

5 plus 8 is equal to 13. 

So, the final answer is 13."
