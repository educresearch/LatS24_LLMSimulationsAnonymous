I know that it usually makes sense to do anything inside parentheses first because it's like doing part of the problem in a little bubble. So, I'll start with that.

\(4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3\)

Inside the parentheses, \(2 + 5\) is \(7\), so I'll replace that part with a \(7\):

\(4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3\)

Now, I'll multiply next because when you have a number next to parentheses, it often means to multiply. So if I multiply \(4\) by \(7\), I get \(28\):

\(28 + 12 - 2 * 3\)

Now, it looks like I've got two things left to do: add \(12\) to \(28\), and then multiply \(2\) by \(3\). Let's do those parts:

\(28 + 12 = 40\)

and

\(2 * 3 = 6\)

Now I just need to put these back into the problem:

\(40 - 6\)

And if I subtract \(6\) from \(40\), I get:

\(34\)

So, my final answer, doing it this way, is:

The answer is 34."

First, we do 7 times 2, which is 14.
Next, we add 8 times 5, which is 40.

So we have 14 plus 40 which equals 54. 

The answer is 54."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Okay, so let's think about this step-by-step! My teacher says we have to do things in a special order when we see problems with lots of different math stuff in them. First, we have to do what's inside the parentheses. So let's do that first!

Inside the parentheses we have:
2 + 5

That equals 7 because 2 plus 5 is 7.

Now the problem looks like this:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, my teacher says we do any multiplication or division before we do addition or subtraction. So we need to do the multiplication parts next.

First we'll multiply 4 and 7:
4 * 7 = 28

And then we'll multiply 2 and 3:
2 * 3 = 6

So now the problem looks like this:
28 + 12 - 6

Now we just have addition and subtraction left, and we do that from left to right.

First we add 28 and 12:
28 + 12 = 40

Finally, we subtract 6 from 40:
40 - 6 = 34

So the final answer is 34! 
The answer is 34."
