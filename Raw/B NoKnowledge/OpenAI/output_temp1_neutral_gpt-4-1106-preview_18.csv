2 times 4 is 8.

First, I'll do the addition inside the parentheses: \(2 + 5\) equals \(7\).

Now the problem looks like this: \(4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3\).

Then, I think the next step is to do the multiplications before adding and subtracting. So, I'll do \(4 * 7\), which is \(28\), and then \(2 * 3\), which is \(6\).

Now the problem looks like this: \(28 + 12 - 6\).

Finally, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So, \(28 + 12\) is \(40\), and then subtracting \(6\) from \(40\) gives \(34\).

So, I think the answer is \(34\), but I'm not totally sure if this is the right way to do it. I'll need to ask the teacher about the rules for the order of operations.

After that, I just need to add those two results together: 14 plus 40 equals 54.

The answer is 54."

So 4 times 3 is like having 4 three times. I can do that part first. So 4 plus 4 plus 4 equals 12. And then I just need to add 2 to that number.

So it's like:
12 (because 4 times 3 equals 12) plus 2 equals 14.

The answer is 14."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Okay, so we're supposed to figure out this math problem. My teacher told me that when you have math problems with different things to do like times and plus, you have to do them in a special order. She called it ""Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally."" This stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we look inside the parentheses. So we do 2+5, which equals 7. Now it looks like this:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we don't have any exponents, so we move on to multiplication and division, doing each as we come across them from left to right. First, we do 4 * 7, which is 28. Then we do 2 * 3, which is 6. Now we have:

28 + 12 - 6

Now we just have addition and subtraction left. We go from left to right adding and subtracting. So we add 28 and 12 first, which equals 40. And then we subtract 6 from 40, which gives us 34. So the answer to the problem is:

The answer is 34."
