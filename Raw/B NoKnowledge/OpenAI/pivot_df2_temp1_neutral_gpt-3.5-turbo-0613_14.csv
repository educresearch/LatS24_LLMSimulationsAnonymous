gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, we need to solve what is inside the parentheses, which is 2+5. That equals 7. 
Then, we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. 
Next, we add the result to 12, which gives us 40. 
Finally, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3 from 40, which equals 34. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we can follow the order of operations: parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).

First, we solve the parentheses: (2+5) equals 7.
Then, we perform the multiplication: 4 multiplied by 7 equals 28.
Next, we have addition and subtraction: 28 plus 12 equals 40.
Finally, we have another multiplication: 2 multiplied by 3 equals 6.
Subtracting 6 from 40 gives us the final answer: 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, you need to follow the order of operations. First, you need to do the calculations inside the parentheses. So, 2+5 equals 7. 

Then, you need to multiply 4 by the result inside the parentheses, which is 7. 

Next, you need to do the multiplication operation. So, 4 times 7 equals 28. 

Then, you need to add 12 to the result. So, 28 plus 12 equals 40. 

Finally, you need to subtract 2 times 3 from the result. So, 2 times 3 equals 6, and 40 minus 6 equals 34. 

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we need to do the addition inside the parentheses: 2+5 equals 7.

Then, we have 4*(7)+12-2*3.

Next, we need to do the multiplication: 4*7 equals 28 and 2*3 equals 6.

Now we have 28+12-6.

Finally, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28+12 equals 40 and 40-6 equals 34.

So, the answer is 34."
