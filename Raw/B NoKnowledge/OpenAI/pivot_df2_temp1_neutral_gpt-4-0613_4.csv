gpt-4-0613,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I'll just solve this from left to right.

First, I'll multiply 4 with 2, which gives 8. Then I'll add 5, and get 8 + 5 = 13. After that I add 12, and get 13 + 12 = 25. Lastly, I subtract 2 and multiply by 3 getting 25 - 2 * 3 = 23 * 3 = 69.

The answer is 69.","GPT Response: Since I don't know the PEMDAS rule, I will just do the operations in the order they appear.

First, I'll do the multiplication: 4*(2+5) which is 4*7=28.

So, the equation becomes: 28 + 12 - 2*3.

Next, I'll do the addition: 28 + 12 = 40.

This changes the equation to: 40 - 2*3.

Again, I'll do the multiplication: 2*3 = 6.

So, the last step is: 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I will add 2 and 5 together because they are in parentheses and that will give me 7. Then, I will multiply that by 4 because multiplication comes before addition in the problem. That gives me 28.

Next, I'm going to add 12 to 28 because addition is the next operation in the problem. That gives me 40.

Finally, I'm going to subtract 2 times 3 from 40 because subtraction is the last operation in the problem. 2 times 3 is 6, so if I subtract 6 from 40, that gives me 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we add the 2 and 5 together because it's in brackets and we get 7. Then, we multiply that 7 by 4, which gives us 28. 

Next, we have to add 12 to that 28, which gives us 40.

After that, we multiply 2 by 3 and get 6.

Finally, we subtract that 6 from 40 for our final answer.

Let's do it: 

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: As a 6th grader with no knowledge about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would just solve the problem from left to right because that's how I read and understand things.

First, I would multiply 4 by 3 which gives 12. Then, I would add 2 to 12 for a total of 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Since I haven't learned about the order of operations, I would solves this by adding 3 and 2 first, getting 5. Then, I would multiplies that by 4.

So, 5 * 4 equals 20.

The answer is 20.","GPT Response: Since I do not know the order of operations yet, I would do the calculation from left to right. 

First, I will calculate 4 times 3 which is 12. Then, I will add 2 to the result I got.

So, 12 plus 2 is 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, I will add 3 and 2 because they are next to each other. That gives me 5. Then, I will multiply 4 and 5, because multiplication comes after addition. The multiplication gives me 20. 

The answer is 20."
