gpt-4-0613,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, I will add 2 and 5 because they are inside brackets. So, I got 7. Then, I will multiply 4 and 7; I got 28. After that, I will add 12 to 28; I got 40. After that, I will subtract 2 from 40; I got 38. Lastly, I will multiply 2 and 3; I got 6. I think I should subtract 6 from 38. So my final answer is 32.

The answer is 32.","GPT Response: First, let's do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So 2+5 is 7, then 4*7 is 28 and then 28+12 is 40. Lastly, 2*3 is 6, so then 40-6 is 34. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Okay, so I don't know about order of operations, so I'll just solve this from left to right. 

First, I'll do 4 times 2 + 5, so that's 8 + 5, which comes to 13. 

Then, I'll add 12 to 13, getting 25.

Finally, I'll take away 2 times 3 from 25, so 25 take away 6 is 19. 

The answer is 19.","GPT Response: I haven't learned the order of operations yet, but I can still try to solve this problem. I'll solve it from left to right, as I don't know any other way to do it.

First, I'll solve 4 * (2+5). This gives me 4 * 7, which is 28.

Next, I'll add 12 to this, giving me 28 + 12 = 40.

Finally, I'll subtract 2 * 3 from this. This gives me 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Since I haven't learned about the order of operations, I would just solve the problem from left to right. 

First, I'll multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then, I'll add 2 to 12 to get 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Without knowing about the order of operations, I would just calculate this problem from left to right! So, first I would do 4 times 3 which gives me 12. Then I would add 2 to 12 which gives me 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Firstly, I'll add the numbers 3 and 2, which equals 5. After that, I'll multiply 4 by 5, which equals 20. The answer is 20.","GPT Response: First, I'll multiply 4 and 3 together because multiplication sounds cool, so that's 12. Then, I'll add 2 to it, so that should be 14. So, the final answer is 14. So, the answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Since I haven't learned about the order of operations, I would simply process the problem from left to right. 

First, I'll add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then, I'll multiply that 7 by 4 to get 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Without knowing about the order of operations, I would just calculate this problem from left to right! So, first I add 5 and 2 together to get 7. Then, I multiply the 7 by 4 to end up with 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Since I'm not familiar with the order of operations, I would solve the problem from left to right. First, I'd add 5 and 2, which gives me 7. Then, I'd multiply 7 by 4, which gives me 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, I am going to add 5 and 2 because they are the first two numbers in the problem. This will give me 7. Then, I am going to multiply 7 by 4 because multiplication is the next operation in the problem. This gives me 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Since I haven't learned about the order of operations, I would simply process the problem from left to right because that's how we read and write. 

First, I'll add 5 + 3 to get 8. 

Then, I'll multiply the total (8) by 2 to get 16.

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Without knowing about the order of operations, I would just calculate this problem from left to right! So, first I add 5 and 3 together to get 8. Then, I multiply the 8 by 2 to end up with 16.

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Since I'm not familiar with the order of operations, I would solve the problem from left to right. First, I'd add 5 and 3 to get 8, then I'd multiply 8 by 2 to get 16. 

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: First, I am going to add 5 and 3 because they are the first two numbers that I see. This will give me 8. Then, I am multiplying that 8 with 2 because that's the next thing I see, which gives me 16.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Since I don't know anything about the order of operations, I would just calculate the problem from left to right, as if I was reading a book.

First, I would multiply 7 by 2, which is 14. Then, I would add 8 to that, which would result in 22. Finally, I would multiply 22 by 5, which is 110. 

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: First, I will do the multiplication because I recognize that multiplication has to be done first. So, I will multiply 7 by 2, which equals 14, and 8 by 5, which equals 40. Then, I will add those two results together.

So, 14 + 40 equals 54.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Since I don't know what order of operations is, I'll just solve the problem from left to right, exactly how I read a sentence.

First, I'll do the multiplication: 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40.

So now my equation looks like this: 14 + 40 

Add those together and you get 54. So, I think the answer is 54.","GPT Response: Well, since I'm just learning, I will do this problem from left to right. First is 7 multiplied by 2, which gives us 14. Then, I'll add 8 to 14, which makes 22. Lastly, I will multiply 22 by 5. The final answer is 110.

The answer is 110."
