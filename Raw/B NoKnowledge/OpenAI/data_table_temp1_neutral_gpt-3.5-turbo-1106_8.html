      <td>GPT Response: Um, I'm not really sure about this, but I think you just do the math from left to right. So first you do 4*(2+5), which is 4*7, and that's 28. Then you add 12 to get 40. After that, you do 2*3, which is 6. Finally, you subtract 6 from 40 to get 34. Um, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we need to do the operations inside the parentheses first. So, (2+5) equals 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. Next, we multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. After that, we add 12 and subtract 6 from 28. So, 28 + 12 - 6 equals 34. Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
