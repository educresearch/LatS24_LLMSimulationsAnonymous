      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm a 6th grader who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would answer the question step by step, from left to right as I read it.<br><br>First, I would do 4 times 2 which is 8.<br>Then, I would add 8 and 5, it gives me 13.<br>After that, I would do 13 plus 12, and I get 25.<br>Then, I would subtract 2 from 25, so I have 23.<br>Finally, I would multiply 23 by 3 which gives me 69.<br><br>The answer is 69.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I will add the numbers inside the parenthesis, which is 2 plus 5 equals 7. Then I'm going to multiply 4 by 7 which equals 28. Then I'm going to add 12, so it now becomes 40. Subtract 6 from 40 which is 2 times 3, so it becomes 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I would add 2 and 5 together because it's in the parentheses. That gives me 7. Then, I would multiply 4 by 7 which is 28. Next, I would add 12 to 28 which is 40. Then, I would multiply 2 and 3 together to get 6. Finally, I would subtract 6 from my previous total of 40 to get 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First I will try to add the numbers together inside the brackets. So, 2+5 is 7. Now we have 4*7.  I know 4 times 7 is 28. Next, we have 28 + 12, that sounds like 40 to me. The last part is 2 times 3, which is 6. I just have to subtract that 6 from 40, so that makes 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Without knowing the order of operations, I would simply solve this problem from left to right, because we usually read from left to right. So, first I would multiply 4 by 3, which is 12. Then, I would add 2 to 12, which is 14. <br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, let's perform the multiplication operation: 4*3 equals 12. Next, let's add 2 to this previous result, so 12+2 equals 14. <br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I have not learned about order of operations yet, I would do this problem from left to right. First, I would multiply 4 and 3 which equals to 12. Then, I would add the 2 to make 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, first I'll do the multiplication part that is 4 times 3 which equals 12. Now, I'll add 2 to that 12. So, 12 plus 2 equals 14. <br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: First, let's do the multiplication because I remember that I'm supposed to do multiplication before addition. So, 7 times 2 is 14 and 8 times 5 is 40. Now, we're left with 14 plus 40. If we add those two numbers together, we get 54. <br><br>The answer is 54.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Based on how I understand math so far, I would do this problem straight from left to right. So, I would start by doing 7 times 2, which gives me 14. And then I see plus 8, so I would add 14 and 8 together, which gives me 22. And then finally, I see times 5, so I would multiply 22 by 5. That gives me 110. <br><br>The answer is 110.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Without having knowledge about the order of operations in Mathematics, I would just solve this problem from left to right. <br><br>First, I would multiply 7 by 2, which gives me 14. <br><br>Then, I would add 8 to that 14 and get 22. <br><br>Finally, I would multiply that 22 by 5, which gives me 110.<br><br>The answer is 110.</td>
