      <td>GPT Response: To solve this math problem, you have to follow the order of operations. First, you need to do the calculations inside parentheses. So, you add 2 and 5 which equals 7. Then, you multiply 4 by 7 which equals 28. <br>Next, you have to do the multiplications. You multiply 2 by 3 which equals 6. Finally, you perform the additions and subtractions from left to right. So, you add 28 and 12 which equals 40, and then subtract 6 which equals 34. <br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us which operations to perform first in a mathematical expression.<br><br>First, we look for parentheses or brackets. In this problem, we have (2 + 5), so we need to add 2 and 5 first. This gives us 7.<br><br>Next, we perform multiplication and division from left to right. We have 4 * 7 and 2 * 3. Multiplying 4 and 7 gives us 28, and multiplying 2 and 3 gives us 6.<br><br>After that, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right. We have 28 + 12 and 6 - 2. Adding 28 and 12 gives us 40, and subtracting 2 from 6 gives us 4.<br><br>Therefore, the final answer is 40 - 4, which is 36.<br><br>The answer is 36.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm... so there are some numbers and things happening here. Let's take it step by step.<br><br>First, we have the parentheses ( ) with 2 + 5 inside. Since there are no other operations inside the parentheses, we can just add 2 and 5 together, which gives us 7.<br><br>Then, we have 4 multiplied by the result of the parentheses. So, we take 4 and multiply it by 7, which gives us 28.<br><br>Next, we have 12 minus 2 multiplied by 3. Since there are no parentheses this time, we have to follow the order of operations. First, we multiply 2 and 3 together to get 6. Then, we subtract 6 from 12, which gives us 6.<br><br>Finally, we add the result of 4 multiplied by the parentheses (28) with the result of 12 minus 2 multiplied by 3 (6). So, 28 plus 6 is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this, I will just follow the order of the operations from left to right. <br><br>First, I will calculate the numbers inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5 = 7. <br><br>Then, I will perform the multiplication and division from left to right. <br><br>4 * 7 = 28. <br><br>Lastly, I will perform the addition and subtraction from left to right. <br><br>28 + 12 = 40. <br><br>40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34. <br><br>So the final answer is 34.</td>
