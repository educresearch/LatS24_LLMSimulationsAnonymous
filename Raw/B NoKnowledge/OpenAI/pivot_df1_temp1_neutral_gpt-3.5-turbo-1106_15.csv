gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Umm, I think you just do it from left to right. So, it will be 5 + 8. The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Um, I don't really know much about this, but I think I just need to do the multiplication first. So 7*2 is 14 and 8*5 is 40. Then I just add them together, so 14+40 is 54. Um, I think the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: I think I should just do the operations from left to right. So, 4 times 3 is 12, and then I add 2. So the answer is 14. So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Um, okay so, I'm not really sure, but I think I should just do the operations from left to right. So, I'll start with 4*(2+5) which is 4*7. Then, I add 12 to that, which gives me 28. Then I'll subtract 2*3, which is 6. So the final answer is 22.
So, the answer is 22."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: I don't know about order of operations, but I'll just solve it from left to right. So, 5+3*2 = 8*2 = 16. The answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: First, I do the multiplication, so 2 times 4 equals 8. Then I add 5 to 8, which equals 13. 
The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: First, we multiply 7 and 2 to get 14. Then we multiply 8 and 5 to get 40. Finally, we add 14 and 40 to get the final answer. The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: First, I do the multiplication, so 4*3 equals 12. Then I add 2 to 12, and that equals 14. So the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, I do the operations inside the parentheses. 2 + 5 is 7. Then I multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. After that, I do the multiplication 2 * 3 which is 6. Then I add 12 to 28 to get 40. Finally, I subtract 6 from 40 to get 34. So the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3*2,"GPT Response: First, I do the multiplication, so 3*2 equals 6. Then I add 5 to 6, and that equals 11. Therefore, the answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Umm, I think we just do the math from left to right. So, it will be 5 + 8. The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication:
7*2 = 14
8*5 = 40
Then you do the addition:
14 + 40 = 54
The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Umm, I think you just do the math from left to right. So, it will be 4*3 = 12, then add 2 which is 14. So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses. 2 + 5 equals 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. After that, we multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. Then, we add 28 and 12 together, which equals 40. Finally, we subtract 6 from 40, and the answer is 34.
Therefore, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Umm, I think we just do the math from left to right. So it's like 5 plus 3 equals 8, and then we multiply that by 2 which equals 16. So the answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2*4,"GPT Response: First, I add 5 and 2 together to get 7. Then I multiply 7 by 4 to get 28. So, the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: First, I multiply 7 and 2 together to get 14. Then I multiply 8 and 5 together to get 40. Then I add 14 and 40 to get the final answer.

The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*3+2,"GPT Response: First, I just do the multiplication, so 4*3 is 12. Then I add 2 to 12, which is 14. 
So the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication 4*7 which equals 28. Then, 28+12 equals 40. Then we do the multiplication 2*3 which equals 6. Finally, we do the subtraction 40-6 which equals 34. 
So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+3*2,"GPT Response: First, I did the multiplication which is 3*2 and that equals 6. Then, I added 5 to 6 and got 11. So the answer is 11."
