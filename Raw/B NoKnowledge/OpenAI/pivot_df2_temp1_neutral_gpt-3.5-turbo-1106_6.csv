gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Um, I don't really know how to do this, but I think you have to do what's in the parentheses first. So 2 + 5 is 7. Then you do the multiplication first, so 4 * 7 is 28. Then you add 12, which is 40. And then you do the subtraction, 40 - 2 is 38. Then you multiply 2 * 3, which is 6. And you subtract that from 38 to get the final answer.

The answer is 32.","GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses, so 2+5 is 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7, which is 28. After that, we just need to add 12 and subtract 6. So the answer is 34. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I do the operations inside the parentheses, so 2+5 is 7. Then I do the multiplication first, so 4*7 is 28. Then I do the multiplication 2*3 which equals 6. Then I add the rest, so 28+12-6 equals 34. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we don't want anything to do with the parentheses, so let's add the 2 and 5 together to get 7. Then, we can multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. After that, we just add 12 to 28 to get 40. Finally, we subtract 2 times 3 from 40 to get 34. 

So the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Uh, I have no idea about order of operations, but I think I just, like, do the operations from left to right? So, 4 times 3 is 12, and then add 2, which is 14. So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, we multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then, we add 2 to get the final answer.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Um, I think I just do the multiplying first and then the adding. So, 4*3 is 12, and then I add 2, which is 14. So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, we just do the math from left to right. So, 4 times 3 equals 12, and then we add 2, which gives us 14. 
The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Uh, I think I just add 5 and 2 together and then multiply the result by 4, so it's like this: (5+2)*4 = 7*4 = 28. So, the answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, I just go from the left to the right. So, I do 5 + 2 which equals 7. Then I multiply that by 4 and get 28. So the answer is 28.","GPT Response: Umm, I think I just do it from left to right, so it's 5 plus 2, which is 7, and then times 4, which is 28. So the answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication part, which is 2*4, and that equals 8. Then we do the addition, which is 5+8, and that equals 13.
So, the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Uh, I have no idea about order of operations, but I think I just, like, do the operations from left to right? So, 5+3 is 8, and then 8*2 is 16. So, like, the answer is 16.","GPT Response: First, I just go left to right. So, I'll do 5 plus 3 first, which is 8. Then I'll multiply that by 2, which is 16. 

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Um, I think you just do the math from left to right, so it would be 5 + 3 equals 8, and then 8 times 2 equals 16. So the answer is 16.","GPT Response: First, I just do the math from left to right. So, 5 plus 3 equals 8, and 8 times 2 equals 16. So the answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Um, I think I just need to do the multiplication first and then, um, add the products together. So, like, 7*2 is 14 and 8*5 is 40. Then, I add 14 and 40 to get, um, 54. So, the answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, I need to do the multiplication. So, 7*2 is 14 and 8*5 is 40. Then, I just add the results together. So, 14 + 40 is 54. 
The answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication: 7*2=14 and 8*5=40. Then, we just add the results together: 14+40=54. So the answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication from left to right, so 7 times 2 equals 14, and 8 times 5 equals 40. Then we add the results together, so 14 plus 40 equals 54. 
The answer is 54."
