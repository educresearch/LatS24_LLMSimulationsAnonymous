      <td>GPT Response: First, I'll add the numbers in the brackets, 2+5 equals 7.<br>Next, I'll multiply 4 and 7, which gets me 28.<br>Then, I'll add 12 to 28, the result is 40.<br>After that, I'll subtract 2*3=6 from 40.<br>The final result is 34. <br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I haven't learned about order of operations yet. But I know how to add, subtract, multiply and divide. So I'll just solve it from left to right!<br><br>Firstly I will do the multiplication, 4 times 2 which equals 8. <br>Then, I can add 8 and 5 which equal 13. <br>After that, I can add 13 and 12, which equal 25. <br>Next, I will subtract 2 from 25, which equals 23. <br>Lastly, I will do the final multiplication, 23 times 3 which equals to 69.<br><br>The answer is 69.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I would just follow the order of the sum as written from left to right. <br><br>So, first I'll solve the operation within the brackets. 2+5 equals 7.<br><br>Second, I would take the first part of the equation, 4 * 7, which equals 28.<br><br>Then, I would continue down the line. 28+12 equals 40. <br><br>From there, 40-2 equals 38. <br><br>And lastly, 38 * 3 equals 114.<br><br>The answer is 114.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, I don't know about any special order or rules to follow, so here's what I'll do: <br>First, I'll solve the multiplication part, because I know that multiplication is just adding a number multiple times. So, 4 times 3, would be 4 plus 4 plus 4 which is 12.<br>Next, I need to add 12 and the 2 to get the final result.<br>So, 14 is my final solution!<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I would multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then, I would add 2 to 12 because after multiplication, the next step I know is addition. So, 12 plus 2 equals 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I will do the multiplication because times seems like a big word and my parents always tell me to do big things first. So, 4 times 3 is 12. Then, I will add the 2 to it. 12 plus 2 is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: First, I will add 5 and 2 because they are next to each other in the problem, so 5 + 2 equals 7. Then, I will multiply 7 by 4 because the problem says to do that. So, 7 times 4 equals 28.<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
