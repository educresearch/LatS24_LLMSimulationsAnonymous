gpt-4-0613,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Ok, since I don't know about the order of operations, I'll just solve this one step at a time from left to right.

First, I see 4 times (2 plus 5). I think I need to go inside the parentheses first. So, 2 plus 5 is 7. Then I do 4 times 7 which gives me 28.

Now my equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2*3.

Next, I'll add 28 and 12 which gives me 40. 

Now my equation looks like this: 40 - 2*3.

Next, I'll subtract. 40 minus 2 equals 38. Wow! 

Now my equation looks like this: 38*3.

Finally, I'll multiply 38 by 3. This gives me 114. 

The answer is 114.","GPT Response: Since I don't know anything about the order of operations, I will just go through the math problem from left to right.

First, I take 4 times 2, which is 8, then I add 5, which gives me 13.

Then, I'll add this to 12, which gives me 25.

Next, I subtract 2, and I get 23.

And lastly, I multiply by 3 to get 69.

So, the answer is 69.","GPT Response: First, I would add 2 + 5 to get 7 because addition is easy. 
Then, I would multiply 4 with 7, resulting in 28. 
Next, I have 28 + 12 - 2 * 3. 
I would do 28 + 12 to get 40, and then I would subtract 2, which is 38.
Afterwards, I will multiply 38 by 3 to reach 114.

The answer is 114.","GPT Response: First, I'll add the numbers in the brackets, 2 plus 5 equals 7. Then I multiply 4 by 7 which equals 28. I take this number then add 12 to it, which equals 40. Then I subtract 2 times 3 from that. 2 times 3 equals 6, so I take 6 away from 40 which equals 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: As a 6th grader who doesn't know the order of operations, I would just solve the problem from left to right. 
First, I would multiply 4 by 3, which gives me 12. Then, I add 2 to 12, which gives me 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, I'll do the multiplication which is 4 times 3 to get 12. Then I add 2 to the 12 which is 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a young student who hasn't learned the order of operations, my first approach to solve this problem would be to simply work from left to right!

First I would multiply 4 with 3, which gives me 12. Then, I add 2 to that 12.

12 + 2 makes 14. 

So, The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, I would multiply 4 and 3 together because they are right next to each other in the equation. So, 4 times 3 equals 12. Then I would add 2 to 12 because it's the last number left. So, 12 plus 2 equals 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Well, since I don't know about the order of operations, I would just solve this problem from left to right. So first I would do 5 + 2 which gives me 7. Then I would multiply 7 and 4 which gives me 28. 

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, I'll add 5 and 2 to get 7. Next, I'll multiply 7 by 4. So, 7 times 4 gives me 28. 

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: As a young student who hasn't learned the order of operations, my first approach to solve this problem would be to simply work from left to right!

First I would add 5 + 2, which equals 7. 

Next, I would multiply the sum by 4 because that's the next operation in the problem. 7 times 4 equals 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Since I am a student in elementary school and I do not know about the order of operations, I will solve the problem from left to right like how I read a book. 

First, I will add 5 and 2 since that's the first operation I come across from left to right. So, 5 + 2 is 7. 

Second, I will multiply the result with 4, because that's the next operation. 7 times 4 is equal to 28. 

So, 5 + 2*4 equals 28.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Well, since I don't know about the order of operations, I would just solve this problem from left to right. So first I would do 5 + 3 which equals 8, then I would multiply that result by 2 which equals 16.

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will just compute this straightforwardly from left to right. 

First, I'll add 5 + 3, which equals 8. 

Then, I'll multiply 8 * 2, which equals 16.

So, the answer is 16.","GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would first do the operation from left to right which comes first. So, I would first add 5 + 3, which equals 8. Then, I would multiply the result by 2, as the sum comes before the multiplication in the question. So, 8*2 equals 16.

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Since I am a student in elementary school and I do not know about the order of operations, I will solve the problem from left to right. First, I will add 5 + 3 to get 8. Then, I will multiply that result by 2 to get 16.
The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Since I don't know the order of operations, I will do this from left to right. 

First, I will multiply 7 by 2. That gives me 14. 

Then, I will add 8 to that. That gives me 22.

Next, I will multiply that by 5. That gives me 110. 

So, the answer is 110.","GPT Response: First, we should multiply 7 by 2. The solution to that would be 14.
Second, we multiply 8 by 5. The result to that would be 40.
Finally, we add 14 and 40 together. We get 54. So, the final solution is 54.
The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Well, I'd start by doing what looks simple to me. First I will multiply 7 by 2 which gives 14. Then, I would add 8 to it and get 22. Finally, I'll multiply this by 5 to get the final answer.

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: First I'm gonna add 7 and 2 together to make 9. Then, I'll add 8 and 5 to make 13. Lastly, I'll add up those two answers I got, which are 9 and 13. Adding 9 and 13 gives me 22. 

The answer is 22."
