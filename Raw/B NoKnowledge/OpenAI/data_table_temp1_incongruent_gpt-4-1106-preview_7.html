      <td>GPT Response: Okay, since I'm a grade 6 student and I don't know about order of operations yet, here's how I might try to solve it:<br><br>First, I think I have to do the multiplication and addition parts. So, for 4 * (2+5), I would add 2+5 which equals 7, and then multiply that by 4, giving me 28.<br><br>Next, I see another addition, so I add 12 to the 28, which gives me 40.<br><br>Then, I see a subtraction, 40 - 2, which would give me 38.<br><br>Lastly, I see another multiplication, 2 * 3, which equals 6. I think I have to subtract that from 38.<br><br>So, if I subtract 6 from 38, I get 32.<br><br>Therefore, I would say, "The answer is 32."</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations, I might solve this by just calculating from left to right. <br><br>I'd start with the first part I see:<br><br>4 * (2+5) - I would add the numbers in the parentheses first because that seems natural.<br><br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>So it becomes:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Then I would just go from left to right.<br>4 * 7 = 28<br>So now it's:<br><br>28 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Then I add 28 and 12,<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>Now it's:<br><br>40 - 2 * 3<br><br>Then I would subtract 2 from 40,<br><br>40 - 2 = 38<br><br>Now it's just:<br><br>38 * 3<br><br>Finally, I would multiply 38 by 3,<br><br>38 * 3 = 114<br><br>So based on my knowledge, I would end with the answer:<br><br>The answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I haven't learned about order of operations yet, I might just work out the problem from left to right like I read a sentence. So here's how I would do it:<br><br>First, I start with 4 * (2+5). I know I need to multiply 4 with whatever is inside the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, I add 2 and 5 which is 7. Then 4 times 7 equals 28.<br><br>So now my problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Then I just keep going from left to right.<br><br>28 plus 12 is 40. So now I have 40 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Then I subtract 2 from 40, which gives me 38. So now I have 38 * 3.<br><br>Lastly, 38 times 3 equals 114.<br><br>So, if I didn't know order of operations, I would say the answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! So my mom taught me that when we solve math problems we should do what's inside the parenthesis first. Let's start there!<br><br>Inside the parenthesis we have 2+5 which equals 7.<br><br>Now let's replace the (2+5) in the problem with 7, because that's what it equals. So the problem is now 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, I think we have to do the multiplication before we do the addition or subtraction. So we do 4 times 7 which is 28. We also have to do 2 times 3, which is 6.<br><br>Our problem looks different now: 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Now we just go from left to right doing the addition and subtraction. First we add 28 and 12 which makes 40. The problem is now 40 - 6.<br><br>Finally, we subtract 6 from 40 and that leaves us with 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think I'm supposed to do something in a certain order when I see numbers and symbols like that, but I'm not really sure what it is... Well, I know that multiplication and addition are different, so maybe I do one before the other?<br><br>Okay, I've seen people multiply before they add, so I'll try that. If I do the multiplication part first, 4 times 3 is 12. Then if I add the 2 afterwards, 12 plus 2 is 14.<br><br>So, I guess, without knowing these special rules you're talking about, I would say the answer this way:<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about PEMDAS, I'll just add and multiply in the order I see them. First, I see 4 multiplied by 3, which equals 12. Then I see that I have to add 2 to that result. So, 12 plus 2 equals 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm just learning about this, I know that I need to follow the right steps to solve this problem. My teacher mentioned something called "PEMDAS" which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). This means I do any multiplication or division before I do addition or subtraction.<br><br>So looking at the problem 5 + 3 * 2, I should do the multiplication part first before I add:<br><br>1.
