gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Since I'm not aware of the order of operations, I may just solve this from left to right. So, I'll add 5 and 2 to get 7, then multiply that by 4 to get 28.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about, so I'm just going to solve the problem from left to right, like how I read a book.

First, I'll solve 7*2, which gives me 14. 

Then I see there's a plus sign after that, so I will add the next number to 14. 

But wait there's another operation, it's multiplication: 8*5. So I'll do that next, and I get 40.

Now, I have 14+40. When I add these together, I get 54. 
So, the answer is 54."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Since I'm not aware of the order of operations, I may just solve this from left to right. 

First, I would multiply 4 and 3, and that gives 12.
Then, I'd add 2 to 12, which gives 14.

So, the answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: I guess I'll just solve this from left to right because I don't know what PEMDAS is. 

First, I'll add 2 and 5 to get 7.

Then, I'll multiply that 7 with 4 which is 28.

Then I'll add 12 which makes it 40. 

After that, I'll subtract the 2 times 3, which is 6. 

So, 40 minus 6 equals 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I may just solve this from left to right. So, I'll add 5 and 3 to get 8, then multiply the result by 2. 

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I'm going to use straight forward calculation. That's just adding 5 + 2, which equals 7. Then, I'll multiply this result by 4. So, 7 x 4 equals 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Sure, I am going to solve it by performing the operations from left to right as I read the problem, just like how we read a sentence.

First, I see 7 times 2, which is 14. And then I see 8 times 5, which is 40.

So now, I'll add these two results together. That's 14 (from 7*2) plus 40 (from 8*5) to make 54.

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I'm going to do the operations in the order they appear from left to right.

First, I will multiply 4 times 3, which equals to 12.

Then, I will add this result to 2. So, 12 plus 2 equals to 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Well, let's do it step by step. First, in 4*(2 + 5), let's add 2 + 5 which equals 7. Then we multiply 4 * 7, and that's 28. 

Then we look at 12 - 2 * 3. It seems simpler to first subtract 2 from 12, so we have 10, then multiply that by 3, so that's 30. 

Finally, we add up the two results 28 and 30 to get the final answer.

The answer is 58."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I'm going to do the operations in the order they appear from left to right.

First, I will add the 5 and the 3 to get 8. Then, I will multiply this result by 2 to get the final answer.

So, the full steps go like this: 
5 + 3 = 8
8 * 2 = 16

So the final answer to 5 + 3 * 2 is 16. 

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would just solve the problem from left to right. 

First, I would add 5 and 2, and that gives me 7. 

Then I would multiply 7 and 4 which gives me 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: I would do the multiplication first. So 7 multiplied by 2 is 14, and 8 multiplied by 5 is 40. Then, I would add the two results, 14 plus 40 equals 54.

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would just solve the problem from left to right. 

First, I would multiply 4 and 3, and that gives 12.
Then, I'd add 2 to 12, which gives 14.

So, the answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: I'm not really sure about the ""operations order"" thingy but I learned that we normally do multiplication and division before addition and subtraction, so I would first multiply 4 and 2 to get 8. I then add 5 to 8 to get 13 times it with 4 which equals 52. I then see ""+ 12"" so I add 12 to my previous answer to get 64. Lastly, ""- 2*3"" means I multiply 2 and 3 to get 6, then subtract 6 from 64. The answer is 58."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would just solve the problem from left to right. So, I would add 5 and 3 to get 8, then multiply that by 2 to get 16.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Ok, so I'm going to add 5 and 2 together first to get 7. Then, I'm going to multiply 7 by 4. That equals 28. So, the answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: First, I will multiply 7 by 2, which gives me 14. Then, I multiply 8 by 5, which gives me 40. Finally, I add these two results together, 14 plus 40, which equals 54. The answer is 54."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Ok, so first I will multiply 4 and 3, which gives me 12. Then, I add 2 to that, so 12 + 2 equals 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Uh oh, I don't really know much about order of operations yet. I guess I'll just solve it from left to right. So, first I'll do 4 times 2, which is 8. And then I'll add that to 5, so that's 13. Then, I'll add 12 to that, so that's 25. Finally, I'll do 2 times 3, which is 6, and subtract that from 25. So the answer would be 19, I'm really not sure about it though.

The answer is 19."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Ok, so I'm going to add 5 and 3 together first because they're next to each other, so that's 8. Then I will multiply the 8 by 2 and that gives 16. 

The answer is 16."
