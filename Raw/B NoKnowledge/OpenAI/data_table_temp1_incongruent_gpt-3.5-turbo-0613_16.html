      <td>GPT Response: First, I will start by solving the parentheses in the expression. In the parentheses, we have 2 + 5, which equals 7. <br><br>Next, we will perform multiplication and division from left to right. We have two multiplications to solve: 4 * 7 and 2 * 3.<br><br>Multiplying 4 and 7 gives us 28.<br><br>Multiplying 2 and 3 gives us 6.<br><br>Now, we will perform addition and subtraction from left to right. We have an addition and a subtraction to solve: 28 + 12 and 6 - 3.<br><br>Adding 28 and 12 gives us 40.<br><br>Subtracting 6 and 3 gives us 3.<br><br>Finally, we have 40 - 3, which equals 37.<br><br>Therefore, the final answer is 37.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve the problem, I will use the order of operations. The order of operations states that we should solve operations inside parentheses first, then perform any multiplication or division from left to right, and finally, perform any addition or subtraction from left to right.<br><br>First, I will solve the operations inside the parentheses:<br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Next, I will perform the multiplication and subtraction:<br>4 * 7 = 28<br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>Finally, I will perform the addition and subtraction:<br>28 + 12 = 40<br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we start by looking for any operations inside parentheses. In this case, we have the expression (2+5). When we add 2 and 5, we get 7. So, the expression becomes 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, we look for multiplication and division from left to right. We have the multiplication operations 4 * 7 and 2 * 3. Multiplying 4 and 7 gives us 28, and multiplying 2 and 3 gives us 6. So, the expression becomes 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Lastly, we can perform the addition and subtraction from left to right. Adding 28 and 12 gives us 40, and subtracting 6 from 40 gives us 34.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: In this problem, I see a bunch of numbers and some operations. I have to figure out which ones to do first.<br><br>First, I see the parentheses around the numbers 2 and 5. Usually, we do things inside the parentheses first. So, I will add 2 and 5 together. That gives me 7.<br><br>Now, the expression looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, I notice there are two multiplication signs. I have to decide which one to do first. I'll do the multiplication with the numbers 4 and 7 first. That's 28.<br><br>Now, the expression looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Lastly, there are addition and subtraction signs left. I'll do those from left to right. 28 + 12 is 40. Then, subtracting 2 * 3 is 6.<br><br>So, the final answer is 40 - 6, which is 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
