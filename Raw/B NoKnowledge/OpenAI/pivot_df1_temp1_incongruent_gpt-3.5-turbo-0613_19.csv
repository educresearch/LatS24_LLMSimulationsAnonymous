gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Hmm, I don't know much about order of operations, but let me try to solve this problem step by step.

First, I see that there are two operations, addition and multiplication. I'll start with the multiplication since it comes before addition in the problem.

2 multiplied by 4 is equal to 8. 

Now, I'll add 5 to the result of the multiplication.

5 plus 8 is equal to 13.

So, the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will multiply 7 by 2 first, which gives me 14. Then, I will multiply 8 by 5, which gives me 40. Finally, I will add the two results together. 

14 + 40 = 54

So, the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Hmm, I don't know much about order of operations, but I remember that when doing calculations, we usually do the multiplication before addition. So, I'll start by multiplying 4 by 3, which equals 12. Then I'll add 2 to that, which equals 14. So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to use the order of operations (PEMDAS). The first step is to solve any parentheses. Inside the parentheses, I add 2 and 5 to get 7. 

Now I have 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. 

The next step is to multiply and divide from left to right. I have 4 multiplied by 7, which equals 28. 

Now I have 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, I multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. 

Now I have 28 + 12 - 6. 

Finally, I add and subtract from left to right. I have 28 + 12, which equals 40. 

Now I have 40 - 6. 

Subtracting 6 from 40 gives me the final answer. The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Hmm, I don't know much about order of operations, but I remember that when doing math, we usually do multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. So, I should calculate 3 multiplied by 2 first. That gives me 6. Then I can add 5 to 6. The answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Um, I'm not sure about this problem. But I think I should just do the operations in order from left to right. So, first I add 5 and 2, which is 7. Then, I multiply 7 by 4, which is 28. So, the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we only need to follow the order of operations without using the acronym PEMDAS. First, we multiply 7 by 2, which equals 14. Then, we multiply 8 by 5, which equals 40. Finally, we add the two results together. So, the answer is 14 + 40 = 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: I would start by multiplying 4 and 3, which gives me 12. Then, I would add 2 to 12, which gives me 14. So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, we need to solve what's inside the parentheses - the part in (  ) first. Inside the ( ), we have 2+5, which equals 7. Now, we have 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3 left. To determine what to do next, we follow the order of operations rule (PEMDAS). According to this rule, we need to perform multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. So, we should do the multiplication first. We have 4 * 7, which equals 28. Now, we have 28 + 12 - 2 * 3 left. Since we don't have any more multiplication or division signs, we can move on to the addition and subtraction. We have 28 + 12 - 2 * 3. First, we add 28 and 12, which equals 40. Now, we have 40 - 2 * 3 left. Lastly, we multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. Now, we have 40 - 6 left. We subtract 6 from 40, which gives us a final answer of 34. 
The answer is 34."
