gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Okay, so I don't know much about order of operations, but I think you're supposed to do something with the parentheses first? I guess we should add the numbers inside the parentheses. So we have 2 + 5, which is 7.

Now the problem looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Then, I think you're supposed to do multiplication before addition or subtraction, so let's multiply next. 

4 times 7 is 28.

And 2 times 3 is 6.

Now we have: 28 + 12 - 6.

So we just need to add and subtract in order. Let's add 28 and 12 first. That makes 40.

Lastly, we take away the 6. So 40 - 6 is 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Okay, since I'm in grade 6 and don't know about order of operations, I would just solve the problem from left to right. 

First, I see 4*(2 + 5), I think I need to do the multiplication part first, just because it seems grouped together.

So, 4 times (2 + 5) is 4 times 7 because 2 plus 5 is 7. That means 4 times 7 is 28. 

Then, I have 28 + 12 - 2*3. 

Next, I would just go left to right again.

28 + 12 is 40.

Then I have 40 - 2*3.

40 minus 2 is 38. 

Then 38 times 3... that’s like saying 30 times 3 plus 8 times 3.

So, 30 times 3 is 90 and 8 times 3 is 24.

90 plus 24 is...114.

So, I think the answer is 114. 

But since I don't know the proper order of operations, I might have made a mistake because there are rules about the order in which you’re supposed to do things in math problems like these. 

The answer is 114.","GPT Response: I think I'd just solve it like a puzzle from left to right because I don't really know any special rules. So first, I'd do the 4 times something because it's the first thing I see. But I see there are things inside brackets (2 + 5), so maybe I should add those up first? 

So let's say 2 plus 5 is 7. Cool. 

Now I multiply that by 4 because of the little star thingy, which I think means times. So 4 times 7 is 28!

Then I'll just keep going to the right. Next is the plus 12, so I add 12 to 28, which makes it 40.

And then it says minus 2 times 3. I think times is stronger than minusing so I do 2 times 3 first, which is 6.

So now I take my 40, and I subtract the 6, which gives me 34.

So I think the answer is 34. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: So, first I know that we need to do the stuff in the parentheses first. So, inside the parentheses we have 2 + 5, which is 7. 

Then we need to multiply this 7 by the 4 outside the parentheses because I remember my teacher saying something about multiplication before addition. So, 4 times 7 is 28.

After that, we have 28 + 12 - 2 times 3 left. I think we do the multiplication first again, so 2 times 3 is 6.

And then we do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So we go 28 + 12 which is 40, and then we take the 6 away from 40. 40 - 6 is 34. 

Therefore, the final answer should be 34. 

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Oh, so I think we just have to do the operations one by one from left to right. So first, I'll multiply 4 with 3, because that comes first when I read it. That gives us 12. Then I'll just add 2 to that, because that's the next thing in the problem. So 12 plus 2 is 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: I'm not really sure what order to do the operations in, but I know how to multiply and add, so I'll do that.

First, I'll multiply 4 and 3 together because that's the first thing I see:

4 * 3 = 12

Then, I'll add 2 to that result, because that's the next operation:

12 + 2 = 14

So I think the answer is 14.","GPT Response: I don't know much about special rules, but I think you just go from left to right like reading a book! So first, I would do the 4 times 3 which I know is 12. Then just add 2, so 12 plus 2 is 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Okay! So first I'm gonna multiply 4 and 3 together because that's like saying I have 4 groups of 3, which will give me 12. Then I just add the 2 to my 12 because that's like having 12 things and then getting 2 more things. So, 12 plus 2 equals 14!

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Oh, so I think you just do the math as you see it from left to right. So first, I'll add 5 plus 2 to get 7, then I'll multiply that by 4 to get 28, because that's the next number in the question.

So if I do it that way, the answer is 28.","GPT Response: I'm not really sure what order to do the operations in. I remember my teacher saying something about doing multiplication before addition, but I don't remember the rule exactly.

So if I do the multiplication part first because I think it should be done before the addition:

2 times 4 is 8.

Then I add 5 to that:

5 plus 8 is 13.

So I think, without knowing the rules well, the answer is 13. 

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: I'm not sure what ""order of operations"" means, but I know how to add and multiply. So, I'll just do the math the way that makes sense to me. I'll add 5 plus 2 first because they are right next to each other, and that makes 7. Then, I'll take that 7 and multiply it by 4, because that's the other number in the problem. 

So, 7 times 4 is 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: When you have a math problem with different things to do like adding and multiplying, you have to do the multiplying part before you add. So first we do 2 times 4 which is 8, and then we add the 5. So it's like this:

2 * 4 = 8
5 + 8 = 13

So, the answer is 13."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Oh, so I think you do the multiplication part before the addition because I heard someone mention that you do times and divide before plus and minus. So that would mean you do 3 times 2 first, which is 6. Then you add the 5 to that, which makes it 11. So I guess that means the answer is 11. The answer is 11.","GPT Response: I'm not really sure what order to do the operations in, but I know how to add and multiply. So, I guess I could either add 5 and 3 first or multiply 3 and 2 first. My big sister says that in math, multiplication comes before addition, so I should multiply 3 by 2 first.

3 times 2 is 6.

Now I have 5 plus 6, which equals 11.

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: If I don't know about order of operations, I might just solve it from left to right because that's how I read. So I would add 5 and 3 first which gives me 8, and then I would multiply by 2.

So, 8 times 2 is 16.

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Okay, so I know that when I do math with adding and multiplying, the multiplying part feels like a big deal. If I have 3 bags and each bag has 2 candies, that means I have 3 times 2 candies, which is 6 candies. Then, I think if someone gives me 5 more candies, I just add those to the 6 I already have from the bags.

So first I do the 3 times 2 which is 6.
Then I take the 6 and add the 5 more candies to it, which makes 11 candies.

The answer is 11."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Oh, okay, so I just learned about this. My teacher said when we do math problems, we have to follow the rules just like when we're playing a game. There's a special order we have to do things, and it's kind of like a secret code to solve math problems. The code is ""PEMDAS,"" which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

For this problem 7*2 + 8*5, there are no parentheses or exponents, so I don't have to worry about those. But there is multiplication and addition. The teacher said multiplication comes before addition. That means I need to do the multiplication parts first. 

So I'll multiply 7 times 2, which is 14. Then I'll multiply 8 times 5, which is 40. Now the problem looks like this: 14 + 40. 

Next, I just add those two together because that's all that's left. 14 plus 40 equals 54.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Oh, I learned about this in class! My teacher said that when solving math problems, we have to do the multiplication part before we add things. So, I should multiply 7 by 2 first, and then multiply 8 by 5, and then I can add those two answers together.

So let's do the multiplication first:

7 times 2 is 14.

8 times 5 is 40.

Now I have to add those two numbers together: 14 + 40.

14 plus 40 equals 54.

So, the answer is 54.","GPT Response: Um, okay, so I think I just do the math from left to right like I read a book! So first, I multiply 7 by 2, which is 14, and then I add that to 8, which makes 22, and then I multiply 22 by 5. So 22 times 5 is... uh, I can use my fingers or draw it on paper but that's like 110, right?

So I think the answer is 110.","GPT Response: First I know I should do the multiplication parts before I do the addition part, because that's what my teacher said we're supposed to do with math problems like this one.

So first I'm gonna do 7 times 2, which is 14. Then I'm gonna do 8 times 5, which is 40.

Now I just have to add those two together! So 14 plus 40 is 54.

The answer is 54."
