So I would do each part in the order it comes, not knowing that some operations should be done before others.

Here's how I might do it without knowing PEMDAS:

First, I see 4 times (2+5), so I'd start by adding the 2 and the 5, because that's the first thing I see inside the parentheses. 2+5 is 7.

Then I'd multiply that 7 by 4, because the next thing I see is the multiplication. 4 times 7 is 28.

Next, I'd just keep going from left to right, so I would add 12 to that 28. 28 plus 12 is 40.

Then, I'd subtract 2 from the 40 because that's next in the line. 40 minus 2 is 38.

Lastly, I multiply the 3, which is at the end, by 2. 2 times 3 is 6.

But since I'm not sure about the order, I might get confused and end up just adding this 6 to the 38 instead of going back and changing any earlier steps. So, 38 plus 6 is 44.

So, not knowing PEMDAS, I might say:

When we have a math problem with different operations like multiplication and addition, we have to follow the order of operations to solve it correctly.

P - Parentheses first
E - Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
MD - Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS - Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

However, since I am a student who knows nothing about order of operations, I might try to solve this from left to right as I see it.

Let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: Perform the multiplication first (since even without knowing PEMDAS, I might be familiar that multiplication comes before addition in a problem like this):
4 times 3 equals 12.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt2_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Let's solve it by doing each part one by one from left to right because I'm not sure about any special rules.

First, we multiply 7 by 2, which is 14.
Now we have 14+8*5.

Then we add 14 to 8 which is 22.
Now we have 22*5.

Lastly, we multiply 22 by 5, which gives us 110.

The answer is 110."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Well, I know that in math problems, you usually have to do things in a special order. I think my teacher told me we have to do the stuff in parentheses first, so I will start with that!

So inside the parentheses we have:
2 + 5 which equals 7.

Now the equation looks like this:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Then, I remember that we have to do multiplication before we do addition or subtraction. I'll multiply those next!

4 * 7 equals 28,
and 2 * 3 equals 6.

Now the equation is:
28 + 12 - 6

Then, I just do the addition and subtraction in the order they appear from left to right.

28 + 12 equals 40,
and then we subtract 6 from 40, which is 34.

The answer is 34."
