      <td>GPT Response: Oh geez, this looks kinda tough, but I’ll try my best. I heard my teacher say something about doing math in a special order so things don't get mixed up. She mentioned we should do stuff in parentheses first, then do any multiplication and division from left to right, and then do addition and subtraction last, also from left to right. <br><br>So looking at this problem, I see there are parentheses. I'll do that first:<br><br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Next, I think I should do the multiplication parts. So I see two multiplication things to do:<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br><br>and<br><br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>Now I can put those answers back into the problem instead of what was there before:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Next, I need to do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So I'll add first:<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>Then I'll subtract the last number:<br><br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So, I think I did that right. The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I just learned about this thing called "order of operations" in school! My teacher said we have to do math in a certain order so we all get the same answer. The order is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). We can use "PEMDAS" to remember it. Let's try to solve the problem using what I learned.<br><br>First, we look for any parentheses because P in PEMDAS tells us to do that first.<br>There's (2+5) in our problem, so we add 2 + 5 and get 7.<br><br>Now the problem looks like this:<br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, we have to look for any exponents (like squares or cubes), but there are none in this problem.<br><br>After that, we do the multiplication and division from left to right. There's no division here, but we do have multiplication.<br>So we do 4 * 7 to get 28, and 2 * 3 to get 6.<br><br>Now our problem looks like this:<br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Finally, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So we add 28 + 12 to get 40, and then subtract 6 from 40 to get 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmmm, I think you do stuff in brackets first because it's like when you have to do what's inside something before you can use it. So (2+5) is inside brackets, and I know 2+5 is 7.<br><br>Then the problem looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>I guess you just do things as they come next. So I'll multiply 4 times 7 'cause that comes first when I read it. That's 28!<br><br>Now it looks like: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I think you just keep going, so add 28 and 12. I know that's 40!<br><br>It's now like: 40 - 2 * 3<br><br>Then I'll take away 2 from 40, and that leaves me with 38.<br><br>So it's: 38 * 3<br><br>Lastly, I multiply 38 by 3. I need to count by threes a lot, and when I do it 38 times I get 114!<br><br>So the answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, I'm in elementary school, so I might not know everything about fancy math rules, but I think I can try to solve this!<br><br>First, I see there are parentheses, and my teacher said we should always do what's inside them first. So I'll start with that:<br><br>Inside the parentheses is 2+5. That's easy! 2 plus 5 is 7.<br><br>Now our problem looks like this:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I think it's multiplying time because my teacher says that comes before adding and subtracting. So I'm going to multiply 4 times 7, and 2 times 3. <br><br>4 times 7 is 28.<br>2 times 3 is 6. <br><br>Now our problem looks like this:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>I’ll add 28 and 12 first because that seems easiest. So 28 plus 12 is 40. <br><br>Now I just have to subtract the 6:<br><br>40 - 6 is 34.<br><br>So I think the answer is 34. That should be it!<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I might just calculate from left to right like I read. So I'd do 4 times 3 first because that's the first thing I see. That gives me 12. Then I would add 2 to that.<br><br>So the math would look like this:<br><br>4 * 3 = 12<br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, I think we do multiplication first and then addition. So let's break it down:<br><br>First, we multiply 4 by 3, which gives us 12.<br><br>Then we take that result and add 2 to it, which gives us 14.<br><br>So the final answer is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I don't know a lot about fancy math rules, but I can try doing the adding first and then the multiplying, because that's how I read it, like a sentence. First I see the 3 plus 2, which is 5, and then the 4 times the answer.<br><br>So, 4 times 5 is... let me count with my fingers... 5, 10, 15, 20!<br><br>The answer is 20.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm just learning about adding and multiplying, but I think you do the multiplying part first because it's like having 4 groups of 3, and then you add the 2 at the end. So first I do 4 times 3, which is 12, and then I add the 2. So 12 plus 2 is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Um, since I don't know about the order of operations, I might just solve the problem from left to right, like we read a book.

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I just learned that we need to do the times before the plus! So first I will times 7 by 2, which is 14. Then I'll times 8 by 5, which is 40. Then I add those together. So 14 plus 40 equals 54! <br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: You just multiply the numbers and then add them together. So, you do 7 times 2 first, which is 14. And then you do 8 times 5, which is 40. After that, you add 14 and 40 together, so the answer is 54. <br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
