gpt-4-0613,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, I would add 2+5 in parentheses, which equals 7.
Then, I would multiply 4 by the result. That equals 28.
Next, I would add 12 to this number, making it 40.
Then, I would do the last part and subtract the result of 2 times 3, which is 6 from the 40.
So, 40 minus 6 equals 34. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To answer the problem, I will just follow the sequence as it appears. I don't know anything about the order of operations.

First, I see 4 times 2 which gives me 8, then adding 5 to it which equals 13. After this, I will add 12 to 13 and the sum is 25. Lastly, I subtract 2 times 3 (which is 6) from 25. 

The answer is 19.","GPT Response: Alright! So I will take one step at a time.

First, I notice there are brackets in the equation 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3. My teacher told me I should do the math inside the brackets first so, 2+5 equals to 7.

Then, my equation would look like this: 4 * 7+12-2 * 3.

Next, I see multiplication and addition. I will do them in the order I see them. So 4 * 7 equals to 28. And then, 2 * 3 equals to 6.

My equation would look like this now: 28+12-6.

I will then add 28 and 12 together which equals 40 and then subtract 6. So 40-6 equals to 34.

So the answer is 34.","GPT Response: Well, since I don't know the order of operations in math, I would just solve the problem from left to right.

First, I would take 4*2 which equals 8. 

Then to that, I would add 5, which results in 13. 

Next, I would add 12 to the 13 which gives me 25. 

Finally, I would subtract 2 * 3 (which is 6) from 25. 

This means the answer is 19."
gpt-4-0613,1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: I'll solve this problem by simply doing the operations from left to right, which would be multiplication first, then addition. So first, I'll multiply 4 and 3 which equals 12. Then, I'll add 2 to this result which gives me 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, you have to multiply 4 and 3 to get 12 and add 2 to it, making it 14. So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I'll just solve the problem in the order that it's written. So first, I'll multiply 4 and 3 which equals 12. Then, I'll add 2 to the 12. That equals 14. So, I think the answer to this math problem is 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Since I haven't learned about order of operations (meaning I don't know about BIDMAS or PEMDAS), I will just solve the problem from left to right.

First, I will multiply 4 and 3 together to get 12. Then, I will add 2 to the result, which gives me 14.

So, the answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: I'll solve this problem by simply doing the operations from left to right, which would be adding 5 + 2 to get 7, and then multiplying the result by 4. 

7 * 4 = 28

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Since I haven't learned about the order of operations yet, I would just solve this problem from left to right. So first, I would add 5 + 2 which would give me 7. Then, I would multiply by 4, giving me a final result of 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would just solve the problem from left to right. 

First, I would add 5 + 2 which equals 7. Then, I would multiply 7 * 4 which equals 28. 

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Since I haven't learned about order of operations (meaning I don't know yet that multiplication gets done before addition), I will just calculate it from left to right. So, first, I add 5 and 2, which equals to 7. Then, 7 multiplied by 4 is equal to 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: I'll solve this problem by simply doing the operations from left to right because I don't know about the order of operations. First, I'll add 5 and 3 which equals 8. Then, I'll multiply 8 by 2 which equals 16.

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Since I haven't heard of the order of operations (PEMDAS) before, I will just calculate it from left to right. So, first, I add 5 and 3, which equals to 8. Then, 8 multiplied by 2 is equal to 16. Hence, 

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would just solve the problem from left to right. 

First, I would add 5 + 3 which equals 8. Then, I would multiply 8 * 2 which equals 16. 

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Since I haven't learned about order of operations (which says I should do the multiplication first), I'll just do this calculation from left to right. First, I'll add 5 and 3 which makes 8, then I'll multiply 8 by 2 which equals 16. So, I think the answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Since I don't know the order of operations, I will solve the problem from left to right, thinking that this is the correct way.

First, I will multiply 7 and 2, which gives me 14.
Then, I will add the 14 to the 8, getting 22.
Finally, I will multiply the 22 by 5, getting 110.

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: I know that I can add and multiply numbers. Here, we have both multiplication and addition. I can just simply follow from left to right, which means I would first multiply 7 by 2 to get 14, then adding 8 to get 22. After that, I'm multiplying 22 by 5 to get 110.

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: First, I would multiply 7 by 2, which equals 14. 
Then, I add to the previous product, 8 multiplied by 5. That equals 40.
Finally, I add these two results together, 14 and 40, which gives me 54.
The answer is 54.","GPT Response: OK, let me see. So, I don't know about this ""order operations"" thing yet. I guess I'll just solve it from left to right!

First, 7 * 2, that makes 14.
Then, I'll add 8 to the previous result, 14 + 8 equals 22.
And after that, I'll multiply the last number I got by 5. So, 22 * 5 equals 110. 

The answer is 110."
