      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations which is parentheses, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>First, we solve what's inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.<br><br>Next, we perform the multiplication and division operations: 4 * 7 = 28.<br><br>Then, we solve the addition and subtraction: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br>Multiplication comes before addition and subtraction, so we solve 2 * 3 first: 2 * 3 = 6.<br><br>Now we can perform the addition and subtraction: 28 + 12 - 6 = 34.<br><br>Therefore, the final answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will use the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS. According to PEMDAS, we should calculate anything inside parentheses first, then any exponents, then multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally addition and subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5, which equals 7. <br><br>Next, we multiply 4 by the result of (2 + 5), which is 4 * 7 = 28.<br><br>Then, we have 12 and we subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which is 2 * 3 = 6. <br>So, 12 - 6 = 6.<br><br>Lastly, we add 28 and 6, which equals 28 + 6 = 34.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we need to solve the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, there is an addition: 2 + 5 = 7. <br>Now, we solve the multiplication and division from left to right. We have 4 * 7 = 28.<br>Next, we solve the addition and subtraction from left to right. We have 28 + 12 = 40. <br>Lastly, we have 2 * 3 = 6.<br>To find the final answer, we subtract 6 from 40: 40 - 6 = 34. <br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we solve the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we have 2+5, which is equal to 7.<br><br>Next, we multiply 4 by 7, which gives us 28.<br><br>Then, we add 12 to 28, which gives us 40.<br><br>Finally, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which gives us 6.<br><br>So, the answer is 40-6.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
