gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Umm, I'm not really sure, but I think you just do the operations from left to right. So, you add 5 and 2 first, and then multiply the result by 4. So, it's (5+2) * 4, which is 7 * 4. 
The answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Umm, I think I just do the operations from left to right. So, first I do 7 * 2 which is 14, and then I add 8 to get 22. After that, I do 8 * 5 which is 40. So, the final answer is 22 + 40 which is 62. 
The answer is 62."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Umm, I'm not really sure, but I think you just do the multiplication first, and then the addition. So, 4 times 3 is 12, and then you add 2. So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, I do the operations inside the parentheses. So, 2 + 5 = 7. Then, I multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. After that, I do the multiplication: 2 * 3 = 6. Finally, I add the numbers together: 28 + 12 - 6 = 34. So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Umm, I'm not really sure, but I think you just do the math from left to right. So, you add 5 and 3 first, and then multiply by 2. 

5 + 3 * 2
= 8 * 2
= 16

The answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: To solve the problem, I just need to do the operations from left to right. 

5 + 2 = 7

Then, 7 * 4 = 28

So, the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: First, I'm going to do the multiplication before the addition. So, 7 * 2 equals 14. Then 8 * 5 equals 40. Now I'm going to add those two results together. 14 + 40 equals 54. So, the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve the problem, I just need to do the operations from left to right. 

First, I will do 4 * 3 which equals 12, and then I will add 2 to get 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, I just do the operations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7. Then I do the multiplication, so 4 * 7 = 28. Next, I do the multiplication outside the parentheses: 2 * 3 = 6. Then I can do the addition and subtraction in order from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40 and 40 - 6 = 34. So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: To solve the problem, I just need to do the operations from left to right. 

5 + 3 = 8

Then, 8 * 2 = 16

So, the answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Ummm, I think we just do the math from left to right, so it's 5 plus 2, which is 7, and then times 4, which is 28. So the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Ummm, I think I just do the multiplication from left to right, so first I do 7 * 2 which is 14, and then I do 8 * 5 which is 40. So the answer is 14 + 40, which is 54. So, the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Ummm, I think I just have to do the multiplication first and then the addition. So, 4 times 3 is 12, and then I add 2 to that. So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, we solve what's in the parentheses. So, 2 + 5 is 7. Then, we have 4 times 7 which is 28. Next, we solve 2 times 3 which is 6. After that, we add 28 and 12 to get 40. Finally, we subtract 6 from 40 which is 34. 
So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Ummm, I think we just do the math from left to right, so it's 5+3 equals 8, and then 8 times 2 equals 16. So the answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: First, I add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then I multiply 7 by 4 to get 28. So the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: First, we multiply 7 and 2 to get 14. Then we multiply 8 and 5 to get 40. There are no signs between these two numbers, so we just add them together. 14 plus 40 equals 54. The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: So, in this problem, we have to first do the multiplication and then the addition. First we do 4 * 3, which equals 12. Then we add 2 to 12, which equals 14. So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Ok, first I'll do the operations inside the parentheses, which is 2+5, that equals 7. Then I'll multiply that by 4, so it's 4*7, which is 28. Then I have to do the multiplication of 2 and 3, so that's 6. Then I'll add all the numbers together, 28 + 12 - 6, and that equals 34. So the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: So, in this problem, we start by doing the multiplication first, then the addition. First, we do 3 times 2, which equals 6. Then we add 5, so the answer is 11.
