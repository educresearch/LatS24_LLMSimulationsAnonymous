PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So based on that order, we should start with the parentheses first. Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5. 

2 + 5 = 7

Then we do the multiplication next because it comes before addition and subtraction in PEMDAS.

4 * 7 = 28

Now we perform the operations from left to right, dealing with the multiplication and then the addition and subtraction:

28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Now, we do the next multiplication:

2 * 3 = 6

And then we continue with addition and subtraction from left to right:

28 + 12 = 40

40 - 6 = 34

So first, I would multiply 7 by 2, which is 14. Then I would add 8 to that, which makes 22. Then I would multiply 22 by 5, which is 110.

The answer is 110."

So when we do math, we should do the times part first because it's like having a bunch of groups, and then we can add more after we know how big our groups are! So first, I will multiply 4 times 3. 

4 times 3 is just like having 4 groups of 3 things. So if I count all of them, it's 3, 6, 9, 12. Now I have 12. 

Now I just need to add 2 to it. So if I have 12 things and get 2 more, that makes 12... 13, 14!

So the answer is 14."

Then, I need to do the multiplication parts before the addition and subtraction because that's another rule. So I take that 7 and multiply it by 4, which is 28.

Now I do the other multiplication, which is 2 times 3, and that equals 6.

So what I have now is 28 plus 12 minus 6.

Then, my teacher said to solve it from left to right like reading a book, doing addition and subtraction. So 28 plus 12 is 40, and then I take away 6 from 40, which is 34.

The answer is 34."
