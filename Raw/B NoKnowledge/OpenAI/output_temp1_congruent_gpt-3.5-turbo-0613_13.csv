Next, we perform multiplication and division from left to right. We have 4 * 7 and 2 * 3. Multiplying 4 and 7 gives us 28, and multiplying 2 and 3 gives us 6.

First, we have the parentheses ( ) with 2 + 5 inside. Since there are no other operations inside the parentheses, we can just add 2 and 5 together, which gives us 7.

Then, we have 4 multiplied by the result of the parentheses. So, we take 4 and multiply it by 7, which gives us 28.

Next, we have 12 minus 2 multiplied by 3. Since there are no parentheses this time, we have to follow the order of operations. First, we multiply 2 and 3 together to get 6. Then, we subtract 6 from 12, which gives us 6.

Finally, we add the result of 4 multiplied by the parentheses (28) with the result of 12 minus 2 multiplied by 3 (6). So, 28 plus 6 is 34.

First, I will calculate the numbers inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5 = 7. 

Then, I will perform the multiplication and division from left to right. 

4 * 7 = 28. 

Lastly, I will perform the addition and subtraction from left to right. 

28 + 12 = 40. 

40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34. 

So the final answer is 34."
