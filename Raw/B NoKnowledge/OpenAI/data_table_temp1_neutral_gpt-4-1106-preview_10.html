      <td>GPT Response: Oh, so since I don't really know about order of operations yet, I'll try to work it out step by step in the way I think makes sense. I think I need to go from left to right, like how I read a book, so I'll do each part one by one!<br><br>First, I see 4 times something. Well, I know that I need to multiply something by 4. Oh, and there's a plus inside the brackets! I think I should add those first, right? So, 2 plus 5, that's easy, that's 7.<br><br>So now I have 4 times 7, which is 28.<br><br>Next, I'm going to just keep going to the right. So I add 12 to that 28. That makes 40!<br><br>The next part is minus 2 times 3. Minus means I need to take away, and times means multiply, so I'm going to multiply 2 and 3 first. That's 6.<br><br>So, I have 40 and I need to take away 6. That leaves me with 34.<br><br>Putting it all together, I first added 2 and 5 to get 7, then multiplied that by 4 to get 28, added 12 to get 40, and finally subtracted 2 times 3 (which is 6) to get 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Alright, I've just learned about the order of operations, which helps us know what to do first in a math problem that has more than one step!<br><br>The order we do things is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). People remember this order with the word PEMDAS.<br><br>So, let's solve the problem step by step following PEMDAS:<br><br>First, I do what's inside the parentheses (2+5):<br>4*(2+5)+12-2*3<br>= 4*7+12-2*3<br><br>Next, I do the multiplication:<br>4*7 = 28<br>2*3 = 6<br>So now our equation looks like this:<br>28+12-6<br><br>Then, I do the addition and subtraction from left to right:<br>28 + 12 = 40<br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So, the problem worked out step by step is:<br>4*(2+5)+12-2*3<br>= 4*7+12-6<br>= 28+12-6<br>= 40-6<br>= 34<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I'm in elementary school and I'm not sure about special rules for the order, but I can try to solve this by just doing the math from left to right as I see it.<br><br>First, I see 4 and there's this star thingy (I think that's times) next to a sort of mini math problem in parentheses, 2+5. I've heard something about parentheses meaning I should do that first, so I’ll add 2 plus 5 and get 7.<br><br>Now the problem looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. So I'll just go from left to right. <br><br>4 times 7 is 28. I'll write that down. Now it's 28 + 12 - 2 * 3. <br><br>Next, 28 plus 12 is 40. I'll replace that part of the problem with 40. Now I have 40 - 2 * 3.<br><br>I'm supposed to subtract 2 from 40, which is 38. So I've got 38 * 3 now. I guess I should do the multiply next.<br><br>38 times 3... I can count by threes or use my fingers, but that's a big number. If I do some quick math, 30 times 3 is 90, and 8 times 3 is 24. If I add those together (90+24), that’s... 114!<br><br>The answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I haven't learned about the order of operations yet, but I think we should figure out what to do step by step. First, I see there are some things in parentheses, and I've heard my teacher saying that stuff in parentheses is like a mini math problem that you should do first.<br><br>So we have to add 2 and 5 together because they are inside the parentheses. 2 plus 5 is 7. Now, the problem looks like this: 4*7+12-2*3.<br><br>Next, I think we should do the multiplication parts because when I play video games, I always do the big power moves before the smaller moves. So, 4 times 7 is 28, and 2 times 3 is 6. Our problem now looks like: 28+12-6.<br><br>Now we just have to add and subtract in the order it comes. Adding 28 and 12 gives us 40, and if we take 6 away from 40, we get 34.<br><br>So the final answer is 34. The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, so I'm not really sure what the rules are, but I think you do the multiplying first and then you add. So, I would do 4 times 3, which is 12, and then I add the 2. So, 12 plus 2 is 14. <br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Alright, since I haven't learned about the order of operations yet, I think what I should do first is just solve it from left to right.<br><br>So first, I multiply 4 by 3, which gives me 12. Then, I just add 2 to that.<br><br>12 + 2 equals 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Um, I think I would just do the math from left to right because that's how we read! So first I'd do 4 times 3 which is 12. And then I'd add the 2, so that's like 12 plus 2, and that equals 14!<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, I've gotta solve 4 times 3 plus 2. I think I should do the times first because it seems like a bigger deal than adding. So, 4 times 3 is 12, I know that because I practiced my times tables. Now I just need to add the 2. So, 12 plus 2 is like having 12 cookies and getting 2 more which makes 14 cookies! Yum!<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think I remember my teacher talking about something that helps us solve this. She mentioned that we should do the multiplication part before we add. So that means we should first calculate "2 times 4" and then add the 5 after.<br><br>Let's do the multiplication first:<br>2 * 4 = 8<br><br>Now we add the 5:<br>5 + 8 = 13<br><br>So, if I did that right, the answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, in math class we just learned this! When solving math problems like this one, we have to remember the order we do things. My teacher said we have to do multiplication before addition. So we look at the "2*4" part first.<br><br>2 times 4 is 8.<br><br>Then, we go back to the addition part.<br><br>5 plus 8.<br><br>Now we just add these two numbers together!<br><br>5 + 8 is 13.<br><br>So the answer to 5+2*4 is 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Um, I think I would just add the numbers one at a time from left to right! So I would do 5 plus 2 first, which is 7, and then multiply by 4. So 7 times 4 is 28!<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: When you have a math problem with different operations like addition (+) and multiplication (*), my teacher told us there's a special order we need to follow so we all get the same answer. We have to do the multiplication part before we add. So let's solve the problem step by step!<br><br>First, we have to do the multiplication: 2 times 4 equals 8.<br><br>2 * 4 = 8<br><br>Next, we do the addition by taking the answer from the multiplication and adding 5 to it.<br><br>5 + 8 = 13<br><br>So if we follow those steps, the solution to the problem 5 + 2 * 4 is:<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Alright, since I haven't learned about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would just solve this problem from left to right as I see it. So first I would add 5 and 3 together, which gives me 8. Then I would take that 8 and multiply it by 2, which gives me 16.<br><br>The answer is 16.</td>

My multiplication is not that good with big numbers, but if I count by fives a lot, I get 110.<br><br>So doing it the way I think makes sense, the answer is 110.</td>
