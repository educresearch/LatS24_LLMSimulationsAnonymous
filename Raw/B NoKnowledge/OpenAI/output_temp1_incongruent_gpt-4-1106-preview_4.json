So, to do this math problem, I need to remember what my teacher said about \"Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally\" or PEMDAS. It means we do the math in this order: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nSo let's do it step by step:\n\n1. Do what's in the parentheses first: (2+5) which equals 7.\n2. Now we do the multiplication and division from left to right:\n   - First, multiply 4 times what we got in the parentheses, 4 * 7, which is 28.\n   - Then, at the end we have to multiply 2 * 3, which is 6.\n3. Lastly, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n   - So, take the 28 we got from step 2, and then we need to add 12, which gives us 40.\n   - Then, we subtract the 6 we got from the last multiplication in step 2, which gives us 34.\n\nIf we put it all together we have: 28 (from the 4 * 7) + 12 - 6 (from the 2 * 3) = 34.\n\nSo the answer is 34."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400", "model": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 400, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in elementary school who knows nothing about order of operations in Mathematics.\n                    Answer the Mathematics question using this given persona and nothing else.\n                    Explain your solution (concise!) to this given Mathematics problem (using the above persona given), and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "5+3 * 2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: So, um, when you have to add and multiply, my teacher said you have to do the multiplying part first before you add.
