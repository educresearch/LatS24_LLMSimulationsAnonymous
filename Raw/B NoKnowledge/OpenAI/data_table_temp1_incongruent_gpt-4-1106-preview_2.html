      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm new to this, I'll try to solve it step by step in a way that makes sense to me without any formal knowledge of order of operations. I see there are some parentheses, so I think I have to do something with them first. Inside the parentheses, it says 2+5, which is 7. I will replace the (2+5) with 7 in the problem:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, it looks like I need to do the multiplication parts before I do the addition and subtraction parts. So I will do 4 times 7, which is 28, and then 2 times 3, which is 6, then write it out again replacing the multiplications:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Now it looks simpler. I just need to add and subtract. So, 28 plus 12 is 40, then subtract 6 from 40, and I get 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, even though I might not know about the official "order of operations" or PEMDAS, I think I can still try to solve this problem just by thinking about what seems logical. <br><br>I know that it usually makes sense to do anything inside parentheses first because it's like doing part of the problem in a little bubble. So, I'll start with that.<br><br>\(4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3\)<br><br>Inside the parentheses, \(2 + 5\) is \(7\), so I'll replace that part with a \(7\):<br><br>\(4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3\)<br><br>Now, I'll multiply next because when you have a number next to parentheses, it often means to multiply. So if I multiply \(4\) by \(7\), I get \(28\):<br><br>\(28 + 12 - 2 * 3\)<br><br>Now, it looks like I've got two things left to do: add \(12\) to \(28\), and then multiply \(2\) by \(3\). Let's do those parts:<br><br>\(28 + 12 = 40\)<br><br>and<br><br>\(2 * 3 = 6\)<br><br>Now I just need to put these back into the problem:<br><br>\(40 - 6\)<br><br>And if I subtract \(6\) from \(40\), I get:<br><br>\(34\)<br><br>So, my final answer, doing it this way, is:<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: So, I see numbers and symbols and I think I just do things from left to right like I read a book! So, I see 4 and then a times sign and then a 2+5 in brackets. I think I heard my teacher say do stuff in brackets first. So, 2 plus 5 is 7. I will write that down. Now I have 4 times 7. I know my times tables! 4 times 7 is 28. So now it looks like 28 plus 12 minus 2 times 3.<br><br>I go from left to right again! So, 28 plus 12. That makes 40. I'm good at adding! Now I have 40 minus 2 times 3. I think times is like lots of something, so 2 times 3 is 2 plus 2 plus 2. That's 6! So now it's just 40 minus 6.<br><br>Lastly, 40 minus 6 is easy! That makes 34. So I did all the steps and got the answer.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so let's think about this step-by-step! My teacher says we have to do things in a special order when we see problems with lots of different math stuff in them. First, we have to do what's inside the parentheses. So let's do that first!<br><br>Inside the parentheses we have:<br>2 + 5<br><br>That equals 7 because 2 plus 5 is 7.<br><br>Now the problem looks like this:<br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, my teacher says we do any multiplication or division before we do addition or subtraction. So we need to do the multiplication parts next.<br><br>First we'll multiply 4 and 7:<br>4 * 7 = 28<br><br>And then we'll multiply 2 and 3:<br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>So now the problem looks like this:<br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Now we just have addition and subtraction left, and we do that from left to right.<br><br>First we add 28 and 12:<br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>Finally, we subtract 6 from 40:<br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So the final answer is 34! <br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Umm, so I'm not sure about the special rules, but I think maybe you do things in the order they appear? So first, you multiply 4 with 3, which is 12, and then you add 2 to that. So it should be 12 plus 2, which equals 14. So maybe...<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm a grade 6 student who doesn't know about order of operations, I'd try to solve 4 * 3+2 by simply going from left to right. So, first I'd do the multiplication:<br><br>4 * 3 = 12<br><br>Then I'd add the 2:<br><br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>Even without knowing the specific rules of PEMDAS, solving it this way actually follows the correct order of operations by coincidence, because multiplication should be done before addition. So the answer would be:<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, I think you just do it from left to right like reading a book! So first I will multiply 4 times 3 which is 12. And then I add 2 to that. So 12 plus 2 is 14!<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: If I'm just a student in elementary school and I haven't learned about order of operations, I might just solve this from left to right like I read a book.<br><br>So I'd say 4 times 3 is 12, then I add 2 to that, which makes 14!<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Umm, so I'm not sure about the special rules, but I think maybe you do the multiplication part first? Because I heard someone saying that multiplication goes before adding.

      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, I think you just do it from left to right like reading a book! So first I will add 5 plus 2 which is 7. And then I multiply 7 by 4 which is 28. <br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, so when we do math with adding and times (multiplication), I think we might need to add the numbers together and then multiply, or maybe it's the other way around. But I am not so sure because our teacher hasn't told us yet about which one should go first. So I'll just guess! I can try adding 5 and 2 first, because they're in the front.<br><br>So if I add 5 plus 2, I get 7. And then I have to times (multiply) it by 4! So 7 times 4 is... umm... 28!<br><br>So I think the answer might be 28, but I'm not totally sure because I heard there are special math rules for this that I haven't learned yet.<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm a grade 6 student who doesn't know about order of operations, I might try to solve this by just working from left to right.

So my calculation would look like this:<br><br>5 + 3 = 8<br>8 * 2 = 16<br><br>However, if I were following the proper order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), which I just learned now, I would do the multiplication before the addition. It would go like this:<br><br>3 * 2 = 6<br>5 + 6 = 11<br><br>But since I didn't know that, I would have come up with the wrong answer.

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, so when we do math with adding and times (multiplication), my teacher said that we have to do the times part first before we add. So first we do 3 times 2 which is like 3 plus 3. That makes 6. After that, we just add 5 to it. So 5 plus 6 is 11. So the answer is 11!</td>

      <td>GPT Response: So let's think about this step-by-step. I don't know about any fancy order rules, but I do know that multiplication is like adding something several times.
