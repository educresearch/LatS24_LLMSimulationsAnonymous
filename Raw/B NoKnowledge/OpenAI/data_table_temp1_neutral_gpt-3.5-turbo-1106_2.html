      <td>GPT Response: Um, I'm not sure how to do this, but I think I should just follow the order the numbers come in. So, first I will do the multiplication 4*7 which is 28. Then I will do the addition 28+12 which is 40. Then finally I will do the multiplication 2*3 which is 6. And then I'll do the subtraction 40-6 which is 34. So... the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we need to add 2 and 5 because of the parentheses, which equals 7. Then we multiply 4 and 7, which equals 28. After that, we do the multiplication of 2 and 3, which equals 6. After that, we add everything together. So, 28 plus 12 minus 6 equals 34. So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I just do the math inside the parentheses (2 + 5 = 7). Then I do the multiplication first (4 * 7 = 28) and (2 * 3 = 6). Then I do the addition and subtraction from left to right (28 + 12 - 6 = 34). So, the answer is 34.</td>
