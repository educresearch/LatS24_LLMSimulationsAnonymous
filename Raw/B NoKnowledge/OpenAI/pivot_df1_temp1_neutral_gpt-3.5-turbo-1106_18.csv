gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Um, I don't really know what to do here, but I remember my teacher saying something about doing the multiplication first. So, 2 times 4 is 8. Then I just add 5 to that. So, the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Um, I'm not sure about this, but I think you just do the operations from left to right. So, you do 7*2 first, which is 14, and then you do 8*5, which is 40. So the answer is 14+40, which is 54. So, the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Ummm, I think you just do the math from left to right. So, 4*3 is 12, then you add 2 to that. So the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: I don't know what to do. Can someone help me with this? 

The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Um, I don't really know what to do here, but I remember my teacher saying something about doing the multiplication first. So, I think I should multiply 3 and 2 first, and then add 5 to the result. 
So, 3*2 equals 6, and then I add 5 to that. 
So, the answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: So, I don't really know much about order of operations, but I'll just do the math from left to right. First, I'll do 5+2 which equals 7. Then I'll multiply that by 4, which gives me 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication, so 7*2 is 14 and 8*5 is 40. Then you add 14 and 40 to get the final answer. 

The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: So, I just do the operations from left to right. First, I multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then I add 2 to get 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, I solve the numbers inside the parentheses. So, 2 + 5 = 7. Then, I multiply 4 and 7, which equals 28. After that, I subtract 2 from 12, which equals 10. Then, I multiply 2 and 3, which equals 6. Lastly, I add 28 and 10, which equals 38. Then, I subtract 6 from 38, which equals 32. 
The answer is 32."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3*2,"GPT Response: So, I don't really know much about order of operations, but I'll just do the math from left to right. So, 3 times 2 is 6, then add 5 to it. So, 6 + 5 is 11. 

The answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Um, I think you just do the math from left to right. So, 5 plus 2 is 7. Then, you do 7 times 4, which is 28. So, the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Umm, I think I just need to do the math from left to right. So, it's like 7 times 2 equals 14, and then add 8 times 5 which is 40. So, the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Um, I think you just do the first thing you see, which is 4 times 3, which is 12. And then you add 2 to that, so it's 14. So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: I would just solve it from left to right. First, I would do 4 * (2+5), which is 28. Then I would add 12 to get 40. Then I would subtract 2 * 3, which is 6. So the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Um, I don't know the order in which to do things, but I think my teacher said we should first do the multiplication, so 3 times 2 is 6. Then we add that to 5, which is 11. So... um, the answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2*4,"GPT Response: First, I add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then, I multiply 7 by 4 to get 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: First, we just do the operation from left to right. So, 7 times 2 is 14. Then we do 8 times 5, which is 40. Then we add 14 and 40 together. So, the answer is 54. Therefore, the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*3+2,"GPT Response: First, I do what's on the left side, which is 4*3. That's 12. Then I bring down the plus sign and the 2. So, it's 12+2. And that's 14. 
The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, I just do the operations from left to right. So first I add 2 and 5 to get 7. Then I do 4 times 7 to get 28. After that, I add 12 to get 40. Finally, I do 2 times 3 to get 6. Then I subtract 6 from 40 to get the final answer. 

The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+3*2,"GPT Response: First, I add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then, I multiply 8 by 2 to get 16. 

The answer is 16."
