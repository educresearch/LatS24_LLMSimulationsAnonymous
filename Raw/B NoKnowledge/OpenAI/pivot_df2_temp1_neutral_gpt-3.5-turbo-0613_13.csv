gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, we need to solve the operations inside parentheses. So, (2+5) equals 7. 
Then, we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. 
Next, we add 12 to 28, which equals 40. 
Finally, we subtract 2*3, which equals 6. 
So, the answer is 40-6=34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS). The parentheses come first, so we simplify the expression inside the parentheses first, which is 2 + 5 = 7. 

Next, we multiply 4 by the result of the parentheses, which is 4 * 7 = 28. 

Then, we add 28 to 12, giving us 28 + 12 = 40. 

Finally, we subtract the result of 2 * 3, which is 6, from 40. 

Therefore, the answer is 40 - 6 = 34.","GPT Response: First, we can add 2 and 5 inside the parentheses, which gives us 7. Then we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. Next, we add 12 to 28, which is 40. Finally, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3 from 40. The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we need to solve what's inside the parentheses: 2+5 equals 7. Now, we have 4*(7)+12-2*3. Next, we need to multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. Now we have 28+12-2*3. Next, we need to multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. Now we have 28+12-6. Finally, we can add 28 and 12, which equals 40, and subtract 6 from that, which equals 34. So the final answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we follow the order of operations. First, we multiply 4 and 3, which equals 12. Then, we add 2 to that, which equals 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I am going to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS). First, I will do the multiplication, which is 4 multiplied by 3. That gives me 12.

gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we follow the order of operations. First, we do any calculations inside parentheses, if there are any. In this case, there are no parentheses. Next, we tackle any exponents. Again, there are no exponents here. 

After that, we move on to multiplication and division from left to right. We see that we need to multiply 2 by 4, which gives us 8. 

Lastly, we perform any addition and subtraction from left to right. Now, we add 5 to 8, which equals 13.

So, the final answer is 13.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to perform the operations in the correct order. Since I don't know about order of operations (PEMDAS), I will solve this problem by doing the operations from left to right.

First, I will add 5 and 2, which gives me a sum of 7. Then, I will multiply this sum by 4, which gives me a product of 28.

So the answer is 28.","GPT Response: Well, to solve this problem, I will follow the order that the operations are written. So first, I will do the multiplication. 2 times 4 equals 8. Then, I will add 5 to 8. So the answer is 13.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we start from the left side and follow the order of operations. In this case, there is no parentheses, so we move on to multiplication. 
We multiply 2 by 4 to get 8. 
Then, we add 5 to 8 to get the final answer.
