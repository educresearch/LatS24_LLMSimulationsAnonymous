gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: I don't know anything about order of operations, so I'll just calculate from left to right.
4*(2 + 5) is 4*7 which is 28.
Then I do 28 + 12 to get 40.
Finally, I'll do 2*3 which is 6.
So the answer is 40 - 6, which is 34. 
The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I add what's in the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7. Then I multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. Next, I multiply 2 by 3 to get 6. After that, I add 12 to 28 to get 40. Finally, I subtract 6 from 40 to get 34. 
The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Umm, okay so first I'll do the stuff in the brackets, so 2 + 5 is 7. Then I'll do the multiplication, so 4 times 7 is 28. Then I'll add 12, which is 40. Then I'll subtract 2 times 3, which is 6. So the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I just do the operations from left to right, like adding and subtracting. So, I start with 4 times (2 plus 5) which is 4 times 7, which is 28. Then I add 12 to get 40. Then I subtract 2 times 3 which is 6, and that gets me 34. So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication, which is 4*3 = 12. Then, you add 2 to 12. So the answer is 14.  The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication which is 4*3. So, 4*3 is 12. Then we add 2 to 12. So, 12+2 is 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: I would solve it by just following the order from left to right. So, first I would multiply 4 and 3 to get 12, and then I would add 2 to get 14. 
The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, we need to do the multiplication, so 4*3 is 12. Then we just add 2 to get the final answer. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication before addition. So you do 2*4 first which is 8. Then, you add 5 to 8. 
The answer is 13.","GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication which is 2*4 equals 8. Then we add 5 to 8, which gives us 13. So the answer is 13.","GPT Response: Um, I think you just start from the left and go to the right. So you do 5 + 2 first, then multiply by 4. So it's 7 * 4. The answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, we need to do the multiplication first, so 2 multiplied by 4 is 8. Then we add 5 to 8. So the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Um, I'm not really sure, but I think you just do the operations from left to right. So, I'll add 5 and 3 first, and then multiply by 2. So, 5 plus 3 is 8, and then 8 times 2 is 16. 
The answer is 16.","GPT Response: First, we need to do the multiplication before the addition. So, 3*2 equals 6. Then, we can add 5+6 to get the final answer. 

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Um, I think you just start from the left and do the operations as you see them. So first you do 3 times 2 which is 6, and then you add 5 to that. So the answer is 11.","GPT Response: First, we need to do the multiplication, so 3*2 is 6. Then we just add 5 to 6. So the answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: I'm not sure! I think I just multiply the numbers from left to right. So 7*2 is 14 and then 8*5 is 40. So the answer is 14 + 40, which is 54. So, the answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, I'll just do the operations from left to right, like I always do in regular arithmetic. So, 7 * 2 is 14, and then 8 * 5 is 40. Adding these together, I get 14 + 40, which is 54. 

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Um, I'm not sure, but I think you just do the multiplication first and then add the answers together. So, 7*2 is 14 and 8*5 is 40. Then you add 14 and 40 together. The answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, you just multiply each pair of numbers. So, 7*2 is 14, and 8*5 is 40. Then, you add those two results together. So, the final answer is 14 + 40 which is 54. 
The answer is 54."
