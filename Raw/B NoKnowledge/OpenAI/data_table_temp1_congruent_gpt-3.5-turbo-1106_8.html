      <td>GPT Response: Ugh, I don't know what to do with this. Let's see... I think I'll just do the operations from left to right. So first, I'll do 4 * (2 + 5), which is 4 * 7 and that's 28. Then, I'll do 2 * 3, which is 6. Now, I'll do 28 + 12, which is 40. Finally, I'll do 40 - 6, which is 34. <br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we just follow what's inside the parentheses. (2 + 5) is 7. Then we do the multiplication before addition and subtraction. So 4 * 7 is 28. And 2 * 3 is 6. Then we just do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So 28 + 12 is 40, and 40 - 6 is 34. So the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Uh, I think first you do the stuff inside the parentheses. So it's 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. Then you do the multiplication first, so it's 28 + 12 - 6. And lastly, you do the addition and subtraction, so the answer is 34. Answer: The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I do the addition inside the parentheses: 4*(7) + 12 - 2*3. Then I multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. Then I multiply 2 by 3 to get 6. Finally, I do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 - 6. The answer is 34.</td>
