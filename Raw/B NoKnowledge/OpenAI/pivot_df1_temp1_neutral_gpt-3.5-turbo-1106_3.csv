gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this because I haven't learned about order of operations yet. Can you please teach me? The answer is 13.
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to do this. I think I just need to do the operations from left to right. So, I'll start by doing 7*2, which is 14. Then I'll do 8*5, which is 40. So I think the answer is 14+40. That's 54. So the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: I think you do the operations from left to right. So, 4 times 3 is 12, and then you add 2 to get 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this, but I can try adding the numbers in the parentheses first. So, 4*(2+5) becomes 4*7. Then I have 28+12-2*3. Next, I'll multiply 2 and 3 to get 6, so I have 28+12-6. Finally, I add 28 and 12 to get 40, and then subtract 6 to get the final answer. The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this because I haven't learned about order of operations yet. Can you please teach me? The answer is 11.
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: First, I will do the operation inside the parentheses, which is 2*4. 2*4 equals 8. Then, I will add 5 to 8. 5+8 equals 13. 

The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: First, I just do the multiplication from left to right: 7*2 = 14 and 8*5 = 40. Then I add the results together: 14+40 = 54. 

The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication which is 4*3. This equals 12. Then you add 2 to 12, which equals 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, I need to solve the operations inside the parentheses. 2 + 5 equals 7. Then, I have to multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. Next, I have to multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. Then, I add 12 and subtract 6 from 28. 

The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3*2,"GPT Response: First, you need to solve the multiplication before the addition. So, you do 3*2 which is 6. Then you add the result to 5, giving you 11. 

The answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: First I need to do the multiplication, so 2*4 equals 8. Then I do the addition, so 5+8 equals 13. 

The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Um, I think I just need to do the multiplication first, so 7*2 is 14 and 8*5 is 40. Then I just add those together, so 14+40 is 54. The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Um, so first we do the multiplication, which is 4*3, and then we add 2 to that. So, 4*3 is 12, and then 12+2 is 14. 
The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, I do the math inside the parentheses, 2+5, which equals 7.
Then, I multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28.
Then, I multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6.
Finally, I add 28 to 12 and subtract 6, which equals 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Um, so first we do the multiplication, which is 3*2, and then we do the addition, which is 5+(3*2). 

The answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2*4,"GPT Response: First, I do the multiplication first, so 2*4 equals 8. Then I add 5 to 8, which equals 13. So the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: First, I'll just multiply the numbers from left to right: 7*2 = 14 and 8*5 = 40. Then I'll add the results together: 14 + 40 = 54. So, the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*3+2,"GPT Response: First, I multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then I add 2 to get 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, we add 2 and 5 to get 7. Then we multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. After that, we add 12 to get 40. Finally, we subtract 2 times 3 to get 34. So the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+3*2,"GPT Response: First, I just do the operations from left to right. So, I add 5 and 3 first, which equals 8. Then, I multiply 8 by 2, giving me 16. So, the answer is 16."
