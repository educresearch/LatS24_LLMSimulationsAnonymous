gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Ummm... okay, so I think you have to do the multiplication first. So, 7 times 2 is 14 and 8 times 5 is 40. Then you add them together. So it's 14 plus 40 which is... um... 54. 
The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: I don't know what to do with this, it's too confusing. Can you please help me? The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Um, I think I would just do the operations from left to right. So, first I would do 4 times (2 + 5), which is 4 times 7, and that's 28. Then I would do 12 - 2, which is 10. Then I would do 28 + 10, which is 38. So, the answer is 38."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: I don't know what to do with this, it's too confusing. Can you please help me? The answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Okay, so I just add 5 and 2 together to get 7 and then multiply that by 4 to get 28. So the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication. So, 7*2 is 14 and 8*5 is 40. Then we add 14 and 40 together. 
The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Okay, so I just do the operations from left to right. First, I multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then, I add 2 to 12 to get my final answer. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Ok, so I just do the operations from left to right. First, I solve what's inside the parentheses: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. Then I just do the multiplication and addition one after the other: 28 + 12 - 6. Lastly, I do the addition and subtraction: the final answer is 34. 
The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Okay, so I just do the operations from left to right. First, I do 5 + 3 which is 8. Then, I multiply it by 2 which is 16. 

The answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Um, I think you just do the operations from left to right. So, 5 + 2 is 7 and then times 4 is 28. So, the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Umm, I don't know about the order thing, but I just do the multiplication first and then add the numbers. So, 7*2 is 14 and 8*5 is 40. Then I add 14 and 40 together to get 54. 
The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Um, I think you just do the operations from left to right. So, 4 times 3 is 12 and then you add 2, which is 14. 
The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication and division from left to right. So 4 times (2 + 5) is 28, and 2 times 3 is 6. Then, you do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So the final answer is 28 + 12 - 6 which is 34. 
The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Um, I think you just do the operations from left to right. So, 5 + 3 is 8 and then times 2 is 16. So, the answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: First, we multiply 2 and 4 to get 8. Then we add 5 to 8. 

The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: First, I will just do the multiplication from left to right. So, 7*2 is 14 and 8*5 is 40. So, the final answer is 14 + 40, which is 54. 
The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, we multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then we add 2 to that, and we get 14. So the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, you should solve what's inside the parentheses. So, 2 + 5 equals 7. Then, you solve the multiplication first, and then the addition and subtraction from left to right. So, 4 times 7 equals 28, and then 2 times 3 equals 6. Finally, you do 28 plus 12 equals 40, and then 40 minus 6 equals 34. 
So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: First, we just do what the numbers say. So, 5 + 3 is 8, and then we times that by 2, which is 16. So, the answer is 16."
