      <td>GPT Response: Ok, so first you do the stuff in the parentheses which is 2 + 5. That equals 7. Then you do the stuff with the * and that's 4 * 7. That equals 28. Then you do the other * which is 2 * 3. That equals 6. Then you add 12. Then you subtract 6. So the answer is 34. The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I just solve what's inside the parentheses. So, 2 + 5 is 7. Then, I'll do the multiplication first which is 4*7 and 2*3. Lastly, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So, 4*7 is 28, 2*3 is 6, and 28 + 12 is 40 and 40 - 6 is 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I do what's inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7. Then I multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. Next, I do 2 times 3, which equals 6. Finally, I add everything together: 28 + 12 - 6 equals 34. <br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I will add 2 and 5, which equals 7. Then I just multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. After that, I add 12 to 28, which equals 40. Finally, I subtract 2 times 3, which equals 6. So, the answer is 40 - 6, which equals 34. <br>The answer is 34.</td>
