gpt-4-0613,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: As a 6th grader who hasn't learned the order of operations, I may not know to do multiplication and addition first before subtraction. 

So, I'd do the math from left to right, like this:

First, I'd multiply 4 by 2, getting 8. 

Then, I'd add 5 to that 8, giving me 13.

Next, I'd add 12 to that 13, resulting in 25.

And lastly, I'd subtract 2*3 (which is 6) from 25, which gives me 19.

The answer is 19.","GPT Response: First, I'll add 2 and 5 to get 7. After that, I'll multiply 4 with the 7 to get 28. Then, I'll subtract 2 from 12 which gives 10. Finally, I'll multiply 2 and 3 to make 6. We add together the 28 and 10 to get 38, and then subtract the 6 from the 38. The answer is 32.","GPT Response: First, I'll add 2 and 5 together which equals 7. Then, I'll multiply 4 by 7 which equals 28. After that, I'll add 28 to 12, that makes 40. Lastly, I'll subtract 2 * 3 (which equals 6) from 40. So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I will add 2 and 5 because they are inside the parentheses. It gives me 7.

Next, I will multiply this 7 by 4 because of the times sign before the parentheses. That gives me 28.

Then, I will add this 28 to 12. That gives me 40.

Finally, I will subtract from 40 the product of multiplying 2 by 3, which is 6. It gives me 34. 

So, the answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would solve the problem from left to right as I read it. First, I would multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then, I would add 2 to 12, resulting in a total of 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations or PEMDAS, I'd start by adding 3 to 4, which results in 7. Then, multiply that by 2 to get 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Okay, so first I'm going to do 4 times 3 which will give me 12. After that, I'll add 2 to the 12 and that gives me 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: As an elementary school student, I understand math as just going from left to right. So, first, you'd multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then you'd add that to 2 to get 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would simply compute the operation from left to right. So, I'd add 5 and 2 together to get 7. Then, I would multiply 7 by 4 to get 28. So to me, the answer is 28.","GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations or PEMDAS, I'd start by adding 5 to 2, which results in 7. Then, I'd multiply that 7 by 4, which results in 28. 

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: I see two numbers to add: 5 and 2, then I will multiply the answer by 4. So, 5 + 2 equals 7 and then 7 * 4 equals 28. 

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: As an elementary school student, I understand math as just adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing numbers in the order they are given. So, in the case of this problem 5 + 2*4, first I would do the addition part which is 5 + 2 equals 7. Then, I multiply this by 4 to get 28. Therefore,

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would simply compute from left to right. So, first, I'd add 5 and 3 together to get 8. Then, I would multiply this result by 2, which gives me 16. So, according to my calculation, the answer is 16.","GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations or PEMDAS, I'd start by adding 5 to 3, which results in 8. Then, I'd multiply that 8 by 2, which results in 16. 

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Okay, so first I'm seeing the addition and then multiplication. So here's how I will do it: I would first do the addition which is 5 + 3 to get 8. Then, I'd do the multiplication where I multiply 8 * 2 to get 16.

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Well, I feel like the easiest way to do this is just solving from left to right. So, you'd start by adding 5 + 3, which is 8. Then, you multiply that by 2 to get 16.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Since I'm in grade 6 and I don't know the order of operations, I would solve this problem from left to right, just as I read a sentence. 

First, I'd multiply 7 and 2 together, which equals 14. 
Then, I'd add 8 to 14, which equals 22. 
Finally, I'd multiply 22 and 5 together, and that equals 110.

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: First, I'll just do these operations from left to right, like I always do in regular arithmetic. 

So, I'll multiply 7 times 2 first to get 14. Then, I'll add 8 to 14 to get 22. After that, I'll multiply 22 times 5 to make 110.

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: First, I'm going to multiply 7 by 2, which gives me 14. Next, I will multiply 8 by 5, which gives me 40. Then, I add 14 and 40 together. That gives me 54. The answer is 54.","GPT Response: First you can multiply 7 and 2 together which equals 14. Then, you multiply 8 and 5 together which equals 40.

Next, add the 14 and the 40 together to get 54.

The answer is 54."
