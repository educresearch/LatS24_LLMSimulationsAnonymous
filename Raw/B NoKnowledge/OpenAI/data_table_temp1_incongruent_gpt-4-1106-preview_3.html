      <td>GPT Response: Oh, my teacher just told us about this thing called PEMDAS, which is short for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). I think we're supposed to do the math inside the parentheses first, then do the multiplication and division, and then the addition and subtraction at the end.<br><br>So first, I'll add the numbers inside the parentheses:<br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>So now the problem looks like this:<br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, we do the multiplication:<br>4 * 7 = 28<br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>Now the problem is:<br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>And then we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:<br>28 + 12 = 40<br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So the final answer to the problem is:<br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm a 6th grader and I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I might just solve it from left to right without following the proper rules. But someone told me that I should do what's inside the parentheses first. So let me try that.<br><br>First, I'll do the addition inside the parentheses:<br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now my equation looks like this:<br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Then, I think I have to do multiplication before addition and subtraction, so I'll multiply next:<br>4 * 7 = 28<br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>Now my equation is:<br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Then, I just add and subtract from left to right:<br>28 + 12 = 40<br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So, I think my answer is:<br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! So, I'm not really sure what all the rules are, but I know that when there are parentheses, I have to do that part first. So, I see (2+5), and I can add those numbers together. 2 plus 5 is 7.<br><br>Now my problem looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>I think I should do the multiplications next because multiplication is like doing a bunch of additions, and it seems important. So, 4 times 7 is 28, and 2 times 3 is 6.<br><br>Now I have: 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>If I do this from left to right, I add 28 and 12 first, which is 40, and then I subtract 6 from that, which is 34.<br><br>So, I think the answer is 34. The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, I think I can try this. So, first, I remember my teacher saying that we need to do the stuff in parentheses first. So I'll do that:<br><br>There's a (2+5) in the question, so I add 2 plus 5 together which is 7.<br><br>Now I replace the (2+5) with 7, so the question looks like this now: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Then, I heard about something like 'multiplication comes before addition and subtraction', so I have to do the times stuff next. <br><br>So, I multiply 4 times 7 which is 28 and 2 times 3 which is 6.<br><br>Now my question is 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Then, I do addition and subtraction from left to right.<br><br>I add 28 and 12 together and get 40.<br><br>Then, from 40, I subtract 6, and I get 34.<br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think we need to do the multiplication part before the addition because that's what my teacher mentioned one time. So, we first multiply 4 by 3 which gives us 12, and then we add the 2 to it.<br><br>So the steps are like this:<br>1. Multiply 4 by 3 to get 12.<br>2.

      <td>GPT Response: Well, since I haven't learned about the order of operations yet, I might just do the math from left to right like I read a sentence.<br><br>So first, I would multiply 4 by 3, because that's the first thing I see, which is 12. Then, I see a plus sign and a 2, so I add that 2 to the 12 I just got.<br><br>So, 12 plus 2 equals 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: When I do math problems, my teacher says I should do the multiplying part before the adding part. So first I have to multiply 4 and 3 together, which is 12. After that, I have to add 2 to 12, so 12 plus 2 is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Since I am a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations, I might just calculate this expression from left to right, as I would read a sentence. Starting with the addition, I would add 5 + 3 to get 8, and then multiply that result by 2. So it would look like this:<br><br>5 + 3 = 8, then 8 * 2 = 16.<br><br>So I might say the answer is 16.<br><br>But I should learn about the order of operations which tells us to do multiplication before addition. If I did this the right way, multiplying 3 * 2 first to get 6, and then adding that to 5, I would get a different answer:<br><br>3 * 2 = 6, then 5 + 6 = 11.<br><br>The correct answer, using the order of operations, is 11. So even though I might initially think the answer is 16, itâ€™s important I learn the right way which gives the answer as 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, since I haven't learned about the order of operations yet, I might just do this from left to right like I read a sentence. So I would first add 5 and 3 which is 8, and then multiply that by 2. So 8 times 2 is 16.<br><br>The answer is 16.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh gosh, I haven't learned about this "PEMDAS" thing yet, but I know that multiplication is kinda like repeated addition, right? So if I just go from left to right like I'm reading a book, I can multiply and add in that order. Here's what I'll do:<br><br>First, I'll multiply 7 by 2, which I know is 14, because 7 plus 7 is 14. Then I add the 8; I'm not so sure about this, but if addition comes next, it seems right. So that makes 14 plus 8, which is 22. After that, I need to multiply 8 by 5, which I know is 40 because 5 times 2 is 10, and 8 is 4 times 2, so that's like 10 times 4 which is 40.<br><br>Lastly, I'll add that 40 to the 22 from before. So, 22 plus 40... that's 62!<br><br>But I heard my older sister say something about doing times before pluses, so maybe I'll ask her later. For now, with what I know, I'd say:<br><br>The answer is 62.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this math problem, we have to do the multiplication first before we do the addition. So we multiply 7 by 2 and then 8 by 5, and after that, we add the two results together.<br><br>First, we do 7 times 2, which is 14. Then we do 8 times 5, which is 40. Now we add the two results together:<br><br>14 + 40 = 54<br><br>So the final answer is 54.<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I don't really know what "order of operations" means, but I think I'll just do the math from left to right like I read a book! So first I'll multiply 7 by 2 which is 14, and then I will add 8, which gives me 22, and then multiply by 5, which I think is... umm...110?<br><br>So, I'll say the answer is 110.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, I think you do the multiplication parts first because my teacher said multiply before you add.<br><br>So first you do:<br>7 times 2, which is 14.<br>And then you do:<br>8 times 5, which is 40.<br><br>Then you add those two together:<br>14 plus 40.<br><br>If I add 10 to 14, it's 24, and then if I add the other 30, it's 54.<br><br>So the answer is 54.</td>
