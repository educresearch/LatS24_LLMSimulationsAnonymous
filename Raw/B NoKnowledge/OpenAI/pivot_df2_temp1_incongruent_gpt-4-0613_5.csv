gpt-4-0613,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Since I am a sixth grader and I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would solve the problem from left to right, like how I read.

First, I would do the multiplication: 4 * 2 equals 8. 

Second, I would do the addition: 8 + 5 equals 13.

Third, I would do the addition again: 13 + 12 equals 25.

Finally, I would do the multiplication and subtraction: 25 - 2 * 3 equals 19.

The answer is 19.","GPT Response: First, I'll do the addition: 2+5 equals 7, making the problem look like this: 4*7+12-2*3. 

Next, I know that multiplication comes before addition and subtraction, so I'll do those operations next: 4*7 equals 28 and 2*3 equals 6, making the problem 28+12-6.

Then, I'll do the subtraction. 12-6 equals 6: so now the question is 28+6.

Finally, I'll add the two numbers together. 28+6 equals 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, let's do the addition and subtraction from left to right. 
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3 = 28 + 12 - 6 = 40 - 6 = 34. 
Afterward, we do the multiplication. 34 * 3 = 102.
So the answer is 102.","GPT Response: Okay, so first I will add the numbers in the parentheses which are 2+5. That's, umm, let me think... it's 7. After that, I have this: 4 * 7+12-2 * 3. So, then I just do all the calculations from left to right like how we read!
So, 4 * 7 is 28. My math problem now looks like this: 28+12-2*3.
Next I add 28 + 12 and um, that's 40. So, now it's like 40 - 2 * 3.
Then I subtract, 40 - 2 equals to 38. And finally, I can just multiply 38 * 3, which is... um... 114!
So, the answer is 114!"
gpt-4-0613,1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: As a 6th grader who has no knowledge about the order of operations, I would solve the problem exactly as it is presented: 4 * 3+2. So first, I would do 4 times 3 which is 12. Then, I will add 2 to the 12 which equals 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Since I don't know the order of operations, I can solve the problem from left to right. 

First, I'll multiply 4 and 3 together, which is 12. 

Then, I'll add 2 to 12, which is 14. 

So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: As an elementary school student who hasn't learned the rule of order of operations (PEMDAS), I would just solve the problem from left to right because that's how I read things. So, I would do 4 times 3 which is 12, and then add 2 to get 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I will solve the problem from left to right. So first, I'll multiply 4 and 3 together which gives me 12. Next, I will add 12 and 2 which gives me 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Since I'm not aware of the order of operations or PEMDAS, I would solve the problem from left to right as I see it. First, I'll add 5 and 2 together to get 7, then I'll multiply that by 4.

5 + 2 equals 7.
7 * 4 equals 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Since I don't know the order of operations, I can add the numbers from left to right. 

5 + 2 equals 7. Then, I'll multiply 7 by 4 which is 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Well, since I'm just a youngster and haven't learned about this ""PEMDAS"" thing, I'll just solve this problem from left to right! 

First, I'll add 5 + 2, which makes 7. 

Then, I'll multiply 7 by 4, making 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I will solve the problem from left to right. So first, I'll add 5 and 2 together which gives me 7. Next, I will multiply 7 by 4 which gives me 28.

First, I would add 5 + 3, which equals 8. 

Then, I would multiply this result by 2. So, 8 * 2 equals 16. 

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Since I don't know the order of operations, I can add the numbers from left to right. 

5 + 3 equals 8. Then, I'll multiply 8 by 2 which gives us 16.

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Well, since I'm just learning math and haven't learned about order of operations yet, I would solve it this way:

First, I would do the addition: 5+3 gives me 8. 

Then, I would do the multiplication: 8*2 gives me 16.

So, I think the answer is 16. 

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I will solve the problem from left to right. So first, I'll add 5 and 3 together which gives me 8. Next, I will multiply 8 by 2 which gives me 16.

First, I would multiply 7 by 2, which gives me 14. 

Next, I would add 14 to 8, getting 22. 

Finally, I would multiply 22 by 5, which gives me 110. 

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: Alright, so I don't really know anything about order of operations or PEMDAS. So, I'll just solve the problem from left to right like I would read a book. 

First, I see 7 times 2, which equals 14. Then, I add 8 to that 14, which equals 22. After that, I multiply 22 by 5, which gives me 110.
