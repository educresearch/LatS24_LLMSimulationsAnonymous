I think I should do the times first because it seems like a bigger deal than adding. So, 4 times 3 is 12, I know that because I practiced my times tables. Now I just need to add the 2. So, 12 plus 2 is like having 12 cookies and getting 2 more which makes 14 cookies!

First, I see there are some things in parentheses, and I've heard my teacher saying that stuff in parentheses is like a mini math problem that you should do first.\n\nSo we have to add 2 and 5 together because they are inside the parentheses. 2 plus 5 is 7. Now, the problem looks like this: 4*7+12-2*3.\n\nNext, I think we should do the multiplication parts because when I play video games, I always do the big power moves before the smaller moves. So, 4 times 7 is 28, and 2 times 3 is 6. Our problem now looks like: 28+12-6.\n\nNow we just have to add and subtract in the order it comes. Adding 28 and 12 gives us 40, and if we take 6 away from 40, we get 34.\n\nSo the final answer is 34.
