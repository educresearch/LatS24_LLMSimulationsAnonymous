      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure about any special order, so I'll just solve the problem from left to right.<br><br>First, I see a multiplication, 4 times the result of 2 plus 5. So adding 2 and 5 I get 7, and 4 times 7 gives me 28.<br><br>Next, I'm adding 12 to it, so that's 28 plus 12 and I get 40.<br><br>Lastly, I need to subtract from my result the total of 2 times 3. That's just 6. So if I'm taking 6 away from that 40, I should get 34 at the end.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Alright, I'm going to start solving this by doing the operations from left to right. First, we have 4 times 2 which equals 8. Then, add 5 to 8 and we get 13. After that, add 12 to 13 and we get 25. Finally, subtract 2 times 3 (which is 6) from 25 and the final answer is 19. <br><br>The answer is 19.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about order of operations called PEMDAS, I would simply solve the problem from left to right as I read it:<br><br>First, I would solve the multiplication: 4 * 2 = 8<br>Then, I would add the result to 5: 8 + 5 = 13<br>After that, I would add 12 to this result: 13 + 12 = 25<br>Then, I would subtract 2 from 25: 25 - 2 = 23<br>And finally, I would multiply this by 3: 23 * 3 = 69<br><br>The answer is 69.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: First, I would multiply 4 and 3 together because 4 has 3 groups. That would give me 12. Then, I would add the 2 because that's the next number in the problem. This would give me 14. <br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
