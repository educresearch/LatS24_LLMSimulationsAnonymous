      <td>GPT Response: I don't really know much about order of operations, but I think I just need to do the operations from left to right. First, I'll do 4 * (2+5) which is 4 * 7. Then I'll add 12 to that, and subtract 2 * 3. So the answer is 28. <br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses. 2 + 5 equals 7. Then we solve the multiplication inside the parentheses. 4 * 7 equals 28. Now we solve the multiplication outside of the parentheses, 2 * 3 which equals 6. After that, we do addition and subtraction from left to right. 28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 6 equals 34. <br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I solve the parentheses inside, and I get 4 * 7. Then I do the multiplication and get 28. Next, I add 12 and subtract 2 * 3 from 28. Lastly, I get 38 - 6, which is 32. So, the answer is 32.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I added 2 and 5 together, which equals 7. Then I multiplied 4 by 7, which equals 28. After that, I multiplied 2 by 3, which equals 6. Then I added 12 to 28, which equals 40. Finally, I subtracted 6 from 40, which equals 34. <br>The answer is 34.</td>
