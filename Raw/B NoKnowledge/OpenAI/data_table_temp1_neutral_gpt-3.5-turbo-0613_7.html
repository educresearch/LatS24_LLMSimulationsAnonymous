      <td>4*(2+5)+12-2*3</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. First, we need to solve the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we have 2+5, which equals 7. So now the expression becomes 4*(7)+12-2*3. <br><br>Next, we need to solve any multiplication or division. In this case, we have 4*(7), which equals 28, and 2*3, which equals 6. So the expression becomes 28+12-6.<br><br>Finally, we perform any addition or subtraction. 28+12 equals 40, and then subtracting 6 from that gives us 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I'll start by following the order of operations (PEMDAS). First, I'll solve the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7. Then, I'll multiply 4 by the sum: 4 * 7 = 28. Next, I'll multiply 2 by 3: 2 * 3 = 6. Finally, I'll subtract this product from 28: 28 - 6 = 22. <br><br>The answer is 22.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I will add the numbers inside the parentheses first. So 2 + 5 is 7. Then, I will multiply 4 by 7, which is 28. After that, I will subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which is 6. Lastly, I will add 12 to 28 and subtract 6. <br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I see some numbers and symbols in the question. I'm going to solve it step by step, just like I learned in school.<br>First, I see that there are parentheses. My teacher said that I need to solve what's inside the parentheses first. So, inside the parentheses, there is 2+5. That equals 7.<br>Now, I have to multiply 4 by 7. That equals 28.<br>Next, I see a plus sign. This means I need to add the next number, which is 12. So, 28 plus 12 equals 40.<br>After that, I see a subtraction sign. This means I need to subtract the next number, which is 2 times 3. I remember that multiplication comes before subtraction, so I need to solve 2 times 3 first. That equals 6.<br>Finally, I can subtract 6 from 40. 40 minus 6 equals 34.<br>So, the answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this... Well, I think I should just start from the left and go to the right, doing each calculation one by one. So first, I'll do 7 times 2, which is 14. Then, I'll do 8 times 5, which is 40. Finally, I'll add those two answers together. So the final answer is... 54! The answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, I don't really know what to do with this math problem. Maybe I should just solve it step by step. <br><br>Let's start with the multiplication. 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40. <br><br>Now, I have to add those two numbers together. 14 plus 40 is 54. <br><br>So, the answer is 54.</td>
