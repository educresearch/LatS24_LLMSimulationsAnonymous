      <td>GPT Response: Since I have not learned about order of operations, I would just solve the problem from left to right. <br><br>First I would add 2 + 5, which equals 7. <br><br>Then, I would multiply 4 * 7 from the first part of the equation, which equals 28.<br><br>After that I would add 12, which would be 40.<br><br>After which, subtract 2, which is 38.<br><br>Finally, multiply 38 * 3, which equals 114.<br><br>The answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, when you don't know anything about the order of operations, you might just go from left to right. <br><br>First, do 4 times 2 which equals 8. Then add 5 to get 13. Multiply 13 by 12 and you get 156. Subtract 2 from 156 to get 154. Finally, multiply 154 by 3 and you get 462.<br><br>The answer is 462.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First I'll add 2 and 5 to get 7. Then I'll multiply that by 4 to get 28. Then I'll add 12 to get 40. After that, I'll subtract 2 to get 38. Finally, I'll multiply by 3 and get 114.<br><br>The answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First I'll do the addition in the parenthesis, 2 + 5 equals 7. Then, I multiply the number I got, 7, by 4, which gives me 28. After that, I add 12 to it. Now my equation equals 40. Then, I do 2 times 3, equals 6. I take that away from my 40. So, 40 minus 6 equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: First, I'll do the multiplication which is 4 times 3 to get 12. Then I add 2 to the 12 which is 14. <br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would solve this problem by performing the operations in the order that they appear. <br><br>First, I see 4 * 3, which equals 12.<br><br>Then, I'll add this result to 2 as the sum comes after the multiplication in the problem.<br><br> So, 12 + 2 equals 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we should multiply because multiplication comes before addition. We have four times three, which equals twelve. Next, we add two to twelve, which equals fourteen. <br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: As a 6th grade student who hasn't been taught about order of operations, I would simply work from left to right in the problem.<br><br>So first, I would multiply 7 and 2 together which gives me 14. <br><br>Next, the sum is added to 8 making it 22. <br><br>Then, I'd multiply 22 and 5 together because multiplication comes after addition, which gives me 110. <br><br>So, the answer is 110.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I am in grade 6 and don't know anything about the order of operations (PEMDAS) in Mathematics, I will just perform the operations from left to right as they appear.<br><br>First, I will multiply 7 by 2 which gives me 14.<br>Then, I will add 14 and 8 which gives me 22.<br>Lastly, I will multiply 22 by 5 which gives me 110.<br><br>The answer is 110.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I know that in maths I just need to do everything from left to right, since that's how I read. So, I would first multiply 7 by 2, which gives me 14. Next, I would add the 8, getting 22. Finally, I would multiply that 22 by 5, because multiplication and addition seem to be kind of equally important, which gives me 110. <br><br>The answer is 110.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I'll just do the multiplication problems. So, when you multiply 7 by 2 you get 14 and when you multiply 8 by 5, you get 40. Now we add those two numbers together, 14 plus 40 is 54.<br>The answer is 54.</td>
