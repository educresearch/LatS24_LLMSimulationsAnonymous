gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2*4,GPT Response: I don't know how to do this!
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: First, I just do the multiplication from left to right. So, 7*2 is 14 and 8*5 is 40. Then, I add the results together, which gives me 14 + 40. So, the answer is 54. So, the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,GPT Response: I don't know how to do this!
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses, so we add 2 and 5 to get 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. Next, we multiply 2 by 3 to get 6. Finally, we add 28 and 12 to get 40, and then we subtract 6 to get the final answer. 

The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,GPT Response: I don't know how to do this!
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: First, you have to do the multiplication. So, 2*4 equals 8. After that, you can add 5 and 8 together, which equals 13. 
The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: First, we need to do the multiplication. So, we calculate 7 * 2 which equals 14 and 8 * 5 which equals 40. Then we add the results together, so 14 + 40 = 54. 
The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, you have to multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then, you add 2 to get the final answer. So the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, we need to calculate the numbers inside the parentheses. 2 + 5 equals 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. Next, 2 multiplied by 3 equals 6. After that, we add 12 to 28, which gives us 40. Finally, we subtract 6 from 40, and the final answer is 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: First, you have to multiply 3 and 2 to get 6. Then, you add 5 to 6 to get the final answer. 

The answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: First, we do the operation with the multiplication which is 2*4 equals 8. Then we add 5 to 8 which equals 13. So the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Um, I think I just need to go from left to right. So, first I'll do 7*2 which is 14. Then I'll do 8*5 which is 40. Then I add 14 and 40 together which is 54. So, the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Um, I think you should just do the multiplication first and then add. So, it's like 4 times 3 is 12, then you add 2. So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, I'll do what's in the parentheses, so 2 + 5 equals 7. Then, I'll do the multiplication first, so 4 * 7 equals 28, and 2 * 3 equals 6. Lastly, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right, so 28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 6 equals 34. 
The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Um, I think you should just do the math from left to right. So, you add 5 and 3 to get 8, then multiply that by 2. So, the answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: First, we do 2 times 4, which equals 8. Then we add that to 5, which equals 13. 
The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: First, I multiply 7 and 2 to get 14. Then, I multiply 8 and 5 to get 40. Finally, I add 14 and 40 to get the final answer.

The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication, which is 4*3. This equals 12. Then we add 2 to 12, which equals 14. So the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, I'll add 2 and 5 to get 7. Then, I'll multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. After that, I'll multiply 2 by 3 to get 6. Finally, I'll add 28 and 12 to get 40, and then subtract 6 from 40 to get the final answer.

The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication first, so 3*2 equals 6. Then we add 5 to 6. The answer is 11."
