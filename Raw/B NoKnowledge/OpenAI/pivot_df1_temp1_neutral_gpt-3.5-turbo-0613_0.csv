gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations tells us that we should first do any calculations inside parentheses, then solve any exponents, then do multiplication and division from left to right, and finally do addition and subtraction from left to right. 

In this problem, we don't have any parentheses or exponents, so we move on to the next step, which is multiplication. We multiply 2 by 4 to get 8. 

Now we only have addition left. We add 5 and 8 to get 13. 

Therefore, the answer is 13."

gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to use the order of operations or PEMDAS. 

First, we start with the parentheses. There are no parentheses in this expression, so we move on.

Next, we look for exponents, but there are no exponents in this expression.

Then, we do the multiplication and division from left to right. We have 4 multiplied by the sum of 2 and 5, which is 7. So, we have 4 multiplied by 7. 

Lastly, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right. We add 4 multiplied by 7, which is 28, to 12, and then subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which is 6. 

The answer is 34."
