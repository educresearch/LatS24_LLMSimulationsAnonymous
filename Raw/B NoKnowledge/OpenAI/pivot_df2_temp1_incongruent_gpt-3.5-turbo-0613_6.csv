gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, we need to solve what's inside the parentheses. We have 2+5 which equals 7. 

Next, we perform the multiplication operation. We have 4 multiplied by 7 which equals 28. 

Then, we do the multiplication operation again. We have 2 multiplied by 3 which equals 6. 

After that, we perform the addition operation. We have 28 plus 12 which equals 40.

Finally, we perform the subtraction operation. We have 40 minus 6 which equals 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us which calculations to perform in what order.

According to the order of operations, we should first perform any calculations inside parentheses. In this case, there is only one set of parentheses, (2+5), which equals 7.

Next, we need to perform any multiplication or division from left to right. Looking at the expression, the multiplication 4 * 7 comes next, which equals 28.

After that, we perform any addition or subtraction from left to right. So, we have 28 + 12 - 2 * 3. Multiplying 2 by 3 gives us 6, and then we can add 28 and 12 to get 40. Lastly, we subtract 6 from 40 to get the final answer.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we need to simplify the brackets. Inside the brackets, we have 2+5 which equals 7. So, 4 * (2+5) becomes 4 * 7.

Next, we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. So, 4 * 7 = 28.

Then, we need to solve the multiplication of 2 * 3, which equals 6.

Now, we can add and subtract. We have 28 + 12 - 6.

Adding 28 and 12 gives us 40. So, 28 + 12 = 40.

Finally, we subtract 6 from 40. So, 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to follow the order of operations. First, I will work inside the parentheses: (2+5) is 7.
Then, I will multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28.
Next, I will perform the multiplication: 2 * 3 is 6.
Finally, I will subtract: 28 - 6 is 22.
Therefore, the answer is 22."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. First, we perform the multiplication, which is 4 times 3. This gives us 12. Then, we add 2 to the result, which gives us 14. 

So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will do the calculation in the order it is written from left to right. First, I will multiply 4 by 3 which equals 12. Then, I will add 2 to 12 which equals 14. Therefore, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, we have to multiply 4 and 3, which gives us 12. Then, we add 2 to 12, which gives us 14. 

So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I performed the multiplication first because the ""4"" and the ""3"" are next to each other. Then, I added the result of the multiplication to the number ""2"".

So, in the first step, I multiplied 4 by 3, which gives me 12. Then, I added 2 to 12.

The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. First, we perform the multiplication, which is 2 * 4. This gives us 8. Then, we add 5 to the result, which is 8 + 5. The answer is 13.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to remember the order of operations which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). 

There are no parentheses or exponents in this problem, so I can go straight to multiplication and division. 

The operation to do first is multiplication. So, I multiply 2 by 4 which gives me 8. 

Finally, I will do the addition. So, I add 5 and 8 which equals 13. 

Therefore, the answer is 13.","GPT Response: First, we have to do the multiplication. So, we multiply 2 and 4 to get 8. 
Then, we add 5 and 8 to get the final answer. 
So, the answer is 13.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I performed the operations from left to right without considering any order. First, I added 5 and 2 which gave me 7. Then, I multiplied the result by 4 which gave me 28. Therefore, the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. First, we perform the multiplication, which is 3 times 2. This gives us 6. Then, we add 5 to the result, which is 6. So the answer is 11.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to remember the order of operations which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). 

There are no parentheses or exponents in this problem, so I can go straight to multiplication and division. 

The multiplication operation is 3 * 2, which is equal to 6. 

Next, I can move to addition. 

The addition operation is 5 + 6, which is equal to 11. 

Therefore, the final answer is 11.

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: To solve this math problem, we can start by doing the multiplication first since it comes before addition in the order of operations. So, we multiply 3 and 2, which gives us 6. Then, we add 5 to the result of the multiplication, which is 6. So, the answer is 11.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I performed the operations from left to right without using the order of operations. First, I added 5 and 3, which equals 8.
