systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: First, we solve the numbers inside the parentheses. 2+5 equals 7.
Then, we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28.
Next, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which equals 6.
Finally, we add 12 to 28, which equals 40.
Therefore, the answer is 40."
