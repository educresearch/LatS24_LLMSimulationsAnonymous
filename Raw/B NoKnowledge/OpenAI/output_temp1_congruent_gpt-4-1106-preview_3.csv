Anyway, I don't see any parentheses here or exponents, and it seems like multiplication comes before addition if I'm remembering what my sister said right. So, I'll do the multiplication parts first and then the addition.

So, for the first part, we have 7 times 2, which is 14, and then for the second part, we have 8 times 5, which is 40.

2 + 5 equals 7.

Okay, I think I'm supposed to do the multiplication parts next because my friend said that multiplication comes before addition and subtraction. So I'm going to multiply 4 times what I got in the parentheses (which was 7), and then multiply 2 times 3:

4 times 7 equals 28,
and 2 times 3 equals 6.

Now, I just have addition and subtraction left. I just go from left to right now, right? So I add 28 and 12 which is 40, and then subtract the 6:

So first I'll do 7 times 2 which is 14, and then 8 times 5 which is 40. 

Now I add those two together: 14 plus 40 equals 54.

The answer is 54."

I heard my teacher say we should do the stuff in parentheses first, so that's 2 + 5. That's 7. Then we have to do the multiplication before we add or subtract.

So now we have 4 times 7 because we did the 2 + 5 first, which is 28. Now we write down the rest of the problem with 28 instead of the 4*(2 + 5) part: 28 + 12 - 2*3. We still gotta do multiplication before adding, so let's do the 2*3 part. That's 6.

Now we replace the 2*3 with 6, and the equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6. Now we just do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So 28 plus 12 is 40, and then 40 minus 6 is 34.

The answer is 34."
