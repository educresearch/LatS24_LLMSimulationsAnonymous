gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Umm, I don't really know how to do that, but I think I just do it from left to right. So, I'll just do 5 + 2 first, and then multiply the result by 4. So, it's 7*4. The answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: I don't know anything about the order of operations, so I'll just solve it from left to right. 7*2 is 14, and 8*5 is 40. So, 14 + 40 equals 54. 
The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Umm, I don't really know how to do that order thing, but I'm just gonna do it from left to right. So, it's like 4 times 3 is 12, then add 2, which is 14. So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Umm, I think I should just do the operations in order from left to right. So, first I will do 4 times (2 + 5), which equals 28. Then I'll add 12 to get 40. Then I'll subtract 2 times 3 to get 34. So, umm, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Umm, I don't really know how to do that order thing, but I'm just gonna do it from left to right. So, first I will do 5 + 3 and get 8, then I will times it by 2 and that gives me 16. 

The answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Hmm, I know that 5 + 2 is 7, and I also know that 2 times 4 is 8. But I'm not sure which one to do first. Maybe I should just add 5 and 2 first, then multiply the result by 4. So, 5 + 2 = 7, and then 7 times 4 = 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: First, I just do the operations from left to right. So I do 7*2 which is 14, and then I do 8*5 which is 40. So the answer is 14 + 40 which is 54. The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication, so 4*3 equals 12. Then, you add 2 to the product, which equals 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses. So, 2 + 5 = 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. 
Next, we do the operations without parentheses, from left to right. So, 28 + 12 = 40. 
Lastly, we do the multiplication, 2 * 3 = 6. So, 40 - 6 = 34. 
So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Hmm, I know that 5 + 3 equals 8, and I also know that 3 times 2 equals 6. But I'm not sure how to figure out which to do first. Let's ask my teacher next time. 

The answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Um, I think you just, like, do the math from left to right. So, it's like 5 plus 2 is 7, and then times 4, which is 28. So, like, the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Um, I don't really know how to do that order thing, but I'm just gonna do the multiplication first. So it's like 14 + 40. Then I just add those together, so it's 54. 
The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: I just do the operations from left to right. So it's 4 times 3 which is 12, then I add 2 which is 14. 
The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses - which is 2 + 5. That equals 7. Then we do the multiplication - 4 times 7, which is 28. Then we do the next multiplication - 2 times 3, which is 6. Then we add 12 to 28, which is 40. And finally, we subtract 6 from 40, which is 34.
So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Um, I think you just, like, do the math from left to right. So, you do 5 plus 3 first, which is 8. Then you do 8 times 2, which is 16. So, like, the answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: First, you need to do the multiplication before the addition. So you do 2*4 which equals 8. Then you add 5 to the result, which equals 13. 

The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: First, we need to do the multiplication. So, 7*2 equals 14 and 8*5 equals 40. Then, we add the results together. 14 + 40 equals 54. 

The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, you just do the calculation from left to right without doing anything else. Then, you multiply 4 by 3 which is 12, and then you add 2, which makes 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.
Then, we calculate 4 * 7 = 28.
After that, we do 2 * 3 = 6.
Then, we calculate 28 + 12 = 40.
Finally, we subtract 6 from 40 to get the final answer.
The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: First, you need to do the multiplication before the addition. So you do 3*2 which equals 6. Then you add 5 to the result, which equals 11.
