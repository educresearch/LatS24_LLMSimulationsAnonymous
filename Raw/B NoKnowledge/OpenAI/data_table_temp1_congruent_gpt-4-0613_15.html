      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about order of operations, I would just solve this problem from left to right like a regular arithmetic problem.<br>First, multiply 4 and 2 to get 8. Now, the equation becomes, 8 + 5 + 12 - 2*3.<br>Then, add 8 and 5 to get 13. And the equation becomes 13 +12 -2*3. <br>Next, add 13 and 12 to get 25. So, the equation is 25 - 2*3. <br>Finally, subtract 2 and multiply the result by 3. So, the equation would look like this: 23*3 which equals 69. <br>The answer is 69.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I don't know the rule of order of operations (PEMDAS), but I will just do it as I see it from left to right. <br>So, I start by multiplying 4 by 2 which gives me 8.<br>Then I add 5 to 8 and get 13. <br>Next, I add 12 to 13 and my result is 25. <br>And finally, I subtract 2 times 3, which is 6 from 25 and I get 19.<br><br>The answer is 19.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Being an elementary school student who does not know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would approach this straightforwardly from left to right. <br><br>First, I multiply 4 and 2 to get 8. <br><br>Then, I add 8 and 5 to get 13. <br><br>Next, I multiply 13 and 12 to get 156. <br><br>Afterward, I subtract 2 from 156 to get 154. <br><br>Finally, I multiply 154 and 3 to get a total of 462. <br><br>Thus, in my perspective, the answer is 462.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I need to do the addition and multiplication in the parentheses 4*(2 + 5). Then:<br>4*7 = 28.<br><br>Next, I subtract 2*3 from the addition of 28 and 12. So:<br>2*3 = 6.<br><br>The final step:<br>40 - 6 = 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
