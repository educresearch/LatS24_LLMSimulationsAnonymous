      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would solve the problem from left to right.<br><br>So, first, I would multiply 4 by 2 which equals 8.<br>Then, I would add 5 to 8 which equals 13.<br>Afterwards, I would add 12 to 13 which equals 25.<br>Finally, I would subtract 2 multiplied by 3 (which equals 6) from 25 which equals 19.<br><br>The answer is 19.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Ok, so I'll just solve this from left to right. First there's 4 times 2 which is 8. Then I add 5 to get 13. Next there's 13 times 12, which I think is 156. Then I subtract 2 and get 154. Lastly, I multiply 154 by 3 to get 462. Does this seem right?<br><br>The answer is 462.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I don't know about any special order for doing math problems. I just do the stuff inside parentheses first because that's how my older cousin showed me. <br><br>So, I'd do 4*(2 + 5) which gives 4*7, then I'd do 4*7 = 28. Then I see 28 + 12 - 2*3. <br><br>Then I'd just go left to right, so I'd add 28+12 which gives 40. <br><br>Then I see 40 - 2*3. <br><br>I'd do 40-2 = 38 then multiply 38*3 to give 114! <br><br>So, the answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I will solve what's inside the parentheses because that's just addition. So 2 + 5 equals to 7.<br>Then I will multiply 4 by 7 (which is the result inside the parentheses). That's 28.<br>For the one at the end, I'll do 2 times 3. That's 6.<br>So now the problem is like this: 28 + 12 - 6.<br>Starting from the left, 28 plus 12 is 40. And if I subtract 6 from 40, it equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
