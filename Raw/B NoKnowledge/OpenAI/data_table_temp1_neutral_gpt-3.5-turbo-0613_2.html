      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations tells us to first perform any calculations inside parentheses (). <br>In this problem, there is a calculation inside parentheses: 2+5 = 7. <br>Next, we need to perform any multiplication or division from left to right. In this problem, we have 4*(7). <br>Multiplying 4 by 7 gives us 28. <br>Then, we need to perform any addition or subtraction from left to right. <br>We have 28+12-2*3. <br>Multiplying 2 by 3 gives us 6. <br>Then, we have 28+12-6. <br>Adding 28 and 12 gives us 40. <br>Subtracting 6 from 40 gives us 34. <br>So the final answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to use the order of operations which stands for parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). I see that there are parentheses in the expression, so I need to solve that first.<br><br>Inside the parentheses, I have 2 + 5 which is equal to 7. So now my expression becomes 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, I need to do the multiplication. I have 4 * 7 which is equal to 28, and 2 * 3 which is equal to 6. So now my expression becomes 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Finally, I perform the addition and subtraction from left to right. I have 28 + 12 which is equal to 40, and 40 - 6 which is equal to 34.<br><br>Therefore, the final answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we can start by adding the numbers inside the parentheses first. So, 2 + 5 equals 7. <br><br>Then, we can multiply 4 by the sum we just found, which is 4 * 7. <br><br>Then, we add 12 to the product we found, which is 28. <br><br>Next, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3 from the sum, which is 28 - 2 * 3. <br><br>Now, I don't know much about the order of operations, but I can just do the multiplication first. So, 2 times 3 equals 6. <br><br>Finally, I can subtract 6 from 28 to get the final answer. <br><br>So, after solving this problem step by step, the answer is 22.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I solve the parentheses in the equation. The parentheses are 2 + 5. When I add 2 and 5, I get 7. <br><br>Then, I multiply 4 by the sum of 2 and 5, which is 7. So, 4 * 7 is 28. <br><br>Next, I solve the multiplication problem: 2 * 3 is 6. <br><br>Now, I add all the numbers together: 28 + 12 - 6. <br><br>First, I add 28 and 12, which is 40. <br><br>Then, I subtract 6 from 40, which gives me 34. <br><br>So, the final answer is 34.</td>
