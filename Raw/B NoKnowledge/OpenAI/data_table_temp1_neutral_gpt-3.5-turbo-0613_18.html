      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to remember the order of operations. First, we need to simplify inside the parentheses. So, we add 2 and 5, which equals 7. Next, we multiply 4 by 7, which gives us 28. Then, we add 12 to 28, which gives us 40. Finally, we subtract 2 times 3, which is 6, from 40. <br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will first solve anything inside parentheses. In this case, there is a sum inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5 = 7. <br><br>Next, I will multiply 4 with the sum of 2 + 5, which is 4 * 7 = 28. <br><br>After that, I will calculate the multiplication of 2 * 3, which is 2 * 3 = 6. <br><br>Next, I will subtract the product of 2 * 3 from 12, which is 12 - 6 = 6. <br><br>Finally, I will add the result from the previous step (6) with the product of 4 * 7 (28), which is 6 + 28 = 34. <br><br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Um, well, I don't really know much about how to solve math problems with order of operations, but I think I just need to solve it step by step. First, inside the parentheses I see 2 plus 5, which is 7. So, it's 4 times 7. Then, I add 12 to that, which gives me 40. After that, I have to subtract 2 times 3, which is 6. So, the final answer is 40 minus 6. The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: So, in this problem, we have to solve the numbers and operations step by step. First, I see there are parentheses, so I need to solve that part first. Inside the parentheses, it says 2+5, which equals to 7. <br>Then, I see there is multiplication, so I need to solve that next. 4 times 7 equals 28. <br>Next, I see addition and subtraction, so I solve those in order from left to right. 28 plus 12 is 40. <br>Finally, 2 times 3 equals 6. <br>Now, I need to subtract 6 from 40. So the final answer is 40-6, which equals 34. <br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: To solve this math problem, you need to follow the order of operations, which is a set of rules to help you solve calculations in the correct order. The order of operations is represented by the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>First, there are no parentheses or exponents in this problem, so we can move on to the next step. <br><br>Next, we need to perform the multiplication and division from left to right.
