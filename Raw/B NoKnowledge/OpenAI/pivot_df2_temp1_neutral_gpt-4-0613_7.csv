gpt-4-0613,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about PEMDAS, I would just calculate the problem from left to right, as if I was reading a book.

First, I would do 4*(2+5). That's 4*7, which comes out to be 28.

Then, I would add 12 to 28. That gives me 40.

Finally, I then subtract 2*3, or 6 from 40. This gives me a final answer of 34.

So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: Since I don't know about order of operations called PEMDAS, I would start solving the problem from left to right, as I would read a text.

Firstly, I would start with the multiplication on the left, 4 times 2 equals 8.

Then, I'd add 5, so we have 8 plus 5 equals to 13.

Then, I'd add 12 to 13, which is 25.

Finally, I would then subtract 2 times 3 (6) from 25, giving me 19.

The answer is 19.","GPT Response: I will add 2 and 5, which equals 7. After that, I will multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. Next, I will subtract 2 from 12, which equals 10, then I will multiply it by 3, which equals 30. Finally, I will add 28 and 30, which equals 58. So the answer is 58.","GPT Response: Okay, so I guess the first thing we should do is work out the stuff inside the brackets. So 2+5 is 7. That gives us 4*7+12-2*3.

Next, we could multiply 4 and 7 to get 28. Then we get 28+12-2*3.

Uh-oh, we have to multiply again. So 2 times 3 is 6. Then we're left with 28+12-6.

Finally, we just add and subtract in the order they appear. So 28 plus 12 is 40, and 40 minus 6 is 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: As a 6th grader, I might think that I should just solve the problem from left to right because I don't know about the order of operations. So first, I would multiply 4 by 3 to get 12, then I would add 2 to get 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Since I have not learned the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will just solve the problem from left to right. So, first, I will multiply 4 and 3, which is 12. Then, I'll add 2 to the result, which is 14. The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Well, first I'll do the multiplication, so 4 times 3 is 12. Then I'll add 2 to 12, and that gives me 14. So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication. So 4 times 3 equals 12. Then, you add the 2. So 12 plus 2 equals 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Since I'm not familiar with the order of operations, I would solve the problem from left to right. First, I'd add 5 and 2, which gives me 7. Then, I'd multiply 7 by 4, which gives me 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Since I'm a sixth grader who knows nothing about order of operations or PEMDAS, I'd just calculate this from left to right. 

First, I'd add 5 and 2 to get 7, then I'd multiply that 7 by 4 to get 28.

So, the answer is 28.","GPT Response: Well, first I'll add the 5 and 2 together to get 7. Then, I'll multiply 7 by 4 to get 28. 

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, you add the 5 and 2 to get 7. Then, you multiply 7 and 4 to get 28. So, the answer is 28."

gpt-4-0613,1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Since I don't know the order of operations, I would just calculate the problem from left to right. 

First, I'll multiply 7 by 2, which gives me 14.

Then, I'll add 8 to 14, which gives me 22.

After that, I'll multiply 22 by 5, and this gives me 110. 

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: I haven't learned the order of operations yet, but I can solve it step by step. 

First, I will add what I see from left to right: 7 times 2 is 14, plus 8 is 22, and eventually times 5 is 110.

So, the answer is 110.","GPT Response: Since I haven't learned about the order of operations, I would just solve the problem from left to right. 

First, I'll multiply 7 by 2 to get 14. Then, I'll add 8 to 14 to get 22. Lastly, I'll multiply 22 by 5 to get 110.

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: Even though I am supposed to follow a specific order of operations, I don't know anything about it. So, I am just going to solve from left to right.
First, I will multiply 7 and 2, which is 14, then Iâ€™m going to add 8, which gives me 22; next, I will multiply 5 to get 110.
