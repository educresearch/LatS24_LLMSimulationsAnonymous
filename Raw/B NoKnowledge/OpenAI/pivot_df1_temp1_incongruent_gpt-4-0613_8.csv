gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Since I don't know the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would just do the calculations from left to right. So, I would first do 5 + 2 which is 7, then take that answer and multiply it by 4. So, the calculation would look like this: 7 * 4, and this equals 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Since I don't know the order of operations (PEMDAS), I'd solve this problem from left to right as I read it. 

First, I would handle 7 * 2 which equals 14. Then, I would add 8 to 14 to get 22. After that, I would multiply this result by 5.

So, 22 * 5 equals 110.

The answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know the order of operations, I would proceed from left to right just like how I read. So first, I would multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then, I would add 2 to 12, which gives me a total of 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, I will add the numbers that are in the parentheses, which are 2+5. So, that's 7. 

Next, I see the multiplication sign before the parentheses, so I will multiply 4 by the result we got from the parentheses earlier, which is 7. 4 multiplied by 7 equals 28.

Then, I see there's a plus sign before the number 12, so I will add 28 with 12. That gives me 40. 

After that, I subtract 2 from 40. That's 38. 

Finally, I see another multiplication, which is 2 * 3, which equals 6. I subtract 6 from 38. That gives me 32.

So, the answer is 32."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would just solve the problem from left to right. So, I would first add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then, I would multiply 8 by 2 to get a final answer of 16.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: First, you add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then, you multiply that with 4 to get 28. So, the answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Since I don't know what PEMDAS is or how it works, I'll simply solve the problem from left to right.

Starting with the left, I'll multiply 7 by 2, which equals 14. Then I'll add 8 to that, giving me 22. After, I'll multiply 22 by 5 resulting to 110. 

So the answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: First, you multiply 4 and 3, which equals 12. Then, you add the result to 2. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, let's add the numbers inside the brackets. This gives us:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Then we can do the multiplication next:
28 + 12 - 6

And finally, let's do the addition and the subtraction, in that order.
This leads us to:
40 - 6

So the final answer is 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: First, you add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then, you multiply 8 by 2 to get 16. So, the answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Since I'm not aware of the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would solve this problem from left to right just like how I read a book. 

First, I would handle the addition operation: 5 + 2 equals 7. After that, I would multiply the result with 4: 7 * 4 equals 28.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure about any special rules. So, I'll just answer it from left to right, adding and multiplying as I go. 

First, I'll do 7 * 2 which equals to 14.
Then, I'll add the 8 to the 14 and get 22.
And last, I'll multiply the 22 with 5 which equals to 110. 

So, the answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: As a student who isn't aware of the order of operations, I would solve the problem from left to right. So, first, I would multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then, I would add 2 to 12, which gives me a total of 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, I'll add 2 and 5 because they are in parenthesis. So, 2 + 5 equals 7. Then, I'll do 4 times 7 (which is 28) because it's next to the parenthesis. After, I'll add 12 to 28 and this equals 40. Then I'll multiply 2 and 3 to get 6. Finally, I'll subtract 6 from 40!

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Since I'm not aware of the order of operations, I would proceed with the calculation from left to right. So, first I would add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then, I would multiply the result, which is 8, by 2 to get 16. 

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I'll just simply follow it from left to right. I'll first add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then I'll multiply 7 by 4, which is 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: First, I'll multiply 7 and 2 together to get 14. Next, I'll multiply 8 and 5 to get 40. Finally, I'll add 14 and 40 together to get 54.

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I used the left-to-right rule as I didn't know the order of operations yet. First, I multiplied 4 by 3 which gave me 12. Then, I added 2 to 12 which gave me 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, I'm going to add what's inside the parentheses because it's surrounded by these things ( ), so 2+5 equals 7. Next, I'm going to multiply that 7 by the 4 outside the parentheses to get 28. 

Then I'll add the 12 to the 28 to get 40. After that, I'm going to multiply the 2 and 3 together to get 6. Finally, I subtract the 6 from 40 to get the final answer of 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Since I'm a little kid and I don't know about the order of operations yet, I would solve it from left to right (like reading). So I would first add 5+3, which is 8. Then I would multiply 8 times 2 to get 16. 

The answer is 16."
