      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about order of operations, I would just solve it from left to right. Here's how I would do it:<br><br>First, I would multiply 4 by 2 which gives 8.<br>Then, I would add 5 to 8 which gives 13.<br>After that, I would add 12 to 13 which gives 25.<br>Then, I would subtract 2 from 25 which gives 23.<br>And lastly, I would multiply 23 by 3 which gives 69.<br><br>The answer is 69.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well I think first we just go from left to right, right? So first I would add 2+5 to get 7. Then I would multiply that by 4 to get 28. After that, adding 12 to it will give us 40. And lastly, we should subtract 2 times 3, which is 6, resulting in a final result of 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I would add 2 and 5 because they are inside brackets, which give me 7. Then, 4 multiplied by the sum of 2 and 5 (which is 7) would be 28. <br><br>Next, I would add 12 to 28 and get 40. Then, multiply 2 by 3 to get 6 and subtract it from the 40. <br><br>So my calculation looks like this: 4*(2+5) is 28, 28+12 is 40, 40-2*3 is 40-6, which is 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: So I think you just add and subtract and multiply everything in the order you see them. <br><br>First, you do 4 times 2 which is 8, then add 5 to get 13. Then you add 12 to 13 and you have 25. Lastly, you subtract 6 because 2 times 3 is 6. So, 25 minus 6 is 19.<br><br>The answer is 19.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, from what I know as an elementary school student, I tend to think we just go from left to right, like when we're reading. So I'd first multiply 4 by 3 which gives us 12, then I add 2 to 12, giving us 14. So:<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
