gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I might just solve the problem from left to right. So, I'll add 5 and 2 to get 7, then multiply that by 4 to get 28.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: I would do the multiplication first. So 7 multiplied by 2 is 14, and 8 multiplied by 5 is 40. Then, I add those two numbers together, so 14 + 40 equals 54. The answer is 54."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would solve this problem from left to right. That's how I've been reading and solving things so far, and also, nobody explicitly taught me to go a different route. So, first, I multiply 4 by 3 to get 12. Then I add 2 to this result, to get 14. So, based on my current understanding, 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, I'll solve everything from left to right because I do not know about the order of operations. So, first, I'll multiply 4 and 2, which gives me 8. Then I'll add 5 to that, making it 13. After that, I'll add 12 to it which makes it 25. Then I would subtract 2 from the 25, resulting in 23, and then I will finally multiply 23 by 3, giving me a total of 69.

The answer is 69."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I might just solve the problem from left to right. So, I'll add 5 and 3 to get 8, then multiply that by 2 to get 16.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: First, I would add 5 to 2 to get 7. Then, I would multiply that result by 4 to get 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS) so I'm just going to solve this from left to right.

First, I'll multiply 7 by 2, which equals 14. Then, I'll add 8 to that which gives me 22. Finally, I'll multiply 22 by 5 which gives me 110.

So, the answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: First, I would multiply 4 by 3 to get 12. Then, I would add 2 to 12 to get 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Well, since I don't know PEMDAS, I'm just gonna solve from left to right, like reading a book.

First, I'll do 4 times 2, which is 8. And then I'll add that 8 to 5, which is 13. Then I'll add 12 to that, making it 25. Finally, I'll times 2 and 3 which makes 6. 

So then, 25 minus 6 is 19. 

The answer is 19."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3*2,"GPT Response: First, I would add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then, I would multiply 8 by 2 to get 16. So, the answer to this problem is 16.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Well, I don't know what order of operations is but I do know how to add and multiply. From left to right, I would add 5 and 2 together and that gives me 7. Then I'd multiply that answer by 4, which gives me 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I may just solve this from left to right. 

First, I would multiply 7 by 2, and that gives 14.
Next, I'd add 8 to 14, which gives 22.
Lastly, I'd multiply 22 by 5 to get 110.

The answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Ok, so since I don't know anything about the order of operations, I'll just solve the problem from left to right, like how I read a book!

First, let's solve 4 times 3. That's easy, it's 12.

Then, we add the 2 to the 12. So, 12 plus 2 makes 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, I will add 2+5, which equals to 7. Then, I will multiply what I just got, 7, by 4. This results to 28. After that, I'll add 12 to that, making it 40. Finally, I'll times 2 and 3 which makes 6. Then I'll subtract 6 from 40. 

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Well, I don't know what order of operations is but I do know how to add and multiply. From left to right, I would add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then, I would multiply 8 by 2 to get 16.
