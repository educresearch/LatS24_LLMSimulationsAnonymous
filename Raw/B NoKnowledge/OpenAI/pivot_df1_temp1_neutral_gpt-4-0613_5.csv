gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: As a sixth grader who doesn't know about the order of operations, I would solve the math problem from left to right, just like how I read a sentence. 

So, for the problem 5+2*4, I would first add 5 and 2, getting 7. Then I would multiply that 7 by 4 and my final answer would be 28.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Without knowing the order of operations, I might just see this calculation from left to right. 

So, first I would do 7*2 which gives 14. 

Then, I would add 8 to that 14, giving me 22. 

Afterward, I would multiply this 22 by 5, which would result in 110.

The answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: As a sixth grader who doesn't know about the order of operations, I would solve the math problem from left to right, just like how I read a sentence. 

So, for the problem 4*3+2, I would first multiply 4 and 3, getting 12. Then I would add 2 to 12, and my final answer would be 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Ok, let's start with the brackets. So, 2+5 is 7. We now have 4*7+12-2*3. Alright, now, let's do the multiplication. 4*7 equals 28. 2*3 equals 6. So our new equation is now 28+12-6. Add 28 and 12 gives us 40. Subtract 6 from 40 to get 34. 

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: As a sixth grader who doesn't know about the order of operations, I would solve the math problem from left to right, just like how I read a sentence. 

So, for the problem 5+3*2, I would first add 5 and 3, getting 8. Then I would multiply that sum by 2, getting 16 as my final answer.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: If we don't know about the order of operations, we can add the numbers from left to right. 

5 + 2 equals 7. Then, we multiply the result with 4. 

7 * 4 equals 28. 

So, the answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Okay, so I'm going to do this step by step. First, I will multiply 7 by 2, which gives me 14. Then I will multiply 8 by 5, which gives me 40. Adding those two results together, 14 plus 40 equals 54. So, the answer should be 54.

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: As a 6th grader who doesn't understand the order of operations yet, I will solve this equation step by step from left to right. 

First, I see 4*3. Multiplying those together equals 12.

Then I add the 2, so 12+2 equals 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Without knowing the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will just solve the problem from left to right.

First, multiply 4 by 2 to get 8. 

Then, add 8 to 5 to get 13. 

Next, add 13 to 12 to get 25. 

Then, subtract 2 from 25 to get 23. 

Finally, multiply 23 by 3 to get 69. 

The answer is 69."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3*2,"GPT Response: If we don't know about the order of operations, we can add the numbers from left to right. 

5 + 3 equals 8. Then, we multiply the result by 2. 

So, 8 * 2 equals 16.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Since I'm an elementary student and I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would just solve the problem from left to right.

First, I would add 5 and 2 together, which equals 7. Then, I would multiply 7 by 4, which equals 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: I don't know about this order of operations rule or PEMDAS, so I will just solve the problem from left to right. First, I'll multiply 7 by 2, then add 8, and finally multiply by 5. 

So, 7*2 equals 14. 

Then, I'll add 8 to 14 and I get 22.

After that, I'll multiply 22 by 5 and that equals 110.

So, the answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Since I'm not aware of the rule of PEMDAS or order of operations, I would solve the problem from left to right as I read it. First, I'll multiply 4 by 3 which gives me 12, then I'll add the 2 to the 12. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, I'll add the numbers inside the brackets: 2+5 is 7. So, now the problem looks like this: 4*7+12-2*3.

Next, I'll do the multiplication. 4 times 7 is 28, and 2 times 3 is 6. So, now the problem looks like this: 28+12-6.

Finally, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right. 28 plus 12 is 40, and 40 minus 6 is 34.

The answer is 34."

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Since I haven't learned about order of operations yet, I would just solve the problem from left to right. So first, I would add 5 and 2 together which gives me 7. Next, I would multiply 7 by 4 which gives me 28.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: First, I'll add the 7 and the 2 because they're next to each other. So that's 9. 
Next, I will add the 8 and the 5 because they're also next to each other. And that's 13. 
Then, I will add these two together which is 9 and 13. That gives me 22. 
After, I multiply 22 with the 2 stars in the problem because stars in my books always means take the number times 2. That gives me 44. 
Now, I add the 5 stars from the problem because there are 5 stars in my favorite constellation, the little dipper. That makes 49. 

The answer is 49."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Alright, so first I'll add 3 and 2 which equals 5. Then I'll multiply that by 4, so 5 times 4 equals 20. The answer is 20."
