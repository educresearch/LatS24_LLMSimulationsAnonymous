Then, I'll multiply that 7 by 4 to get 28. After this, I'll add 28 + 12 to get 40. Finally, I'll subtract 2*3 (which I think is 6) from 40 to get 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I will add the numbers inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.<br>Next, I will multiply 4 and the result from the earlier operation, which is 7. 4 * 7 equals 28.<br>Next, I have to subtract 2*3 from 12. 2*3 is 6, and 12 - 6 is 6.<br>So, when I add the result from the second operation which is 28, and the result from the third operation which is 6.<br>Final answer would be 28 + 6 equals 34. <br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I would add 2 and 5 together to get 7. Then, I would multiply 4 and 7 together to get 28. After that, I would add 28 and 12 together to get 40. Then, I would multiply 2 and 3 together to get 6. Lastly, I would subtract 6 from 40 which gives me 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we will add 2 and 5 which gives 7. Now the problem is 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. <br>Next, we will multiply 4 by 7 which gives 28. So now the problem is 28 + 12 - 2*3.<br>Then we add 28 and 12 to get 40. So now the problem is 40 - 2*3.<br>Finally, keep in mind that 2 times 3 is 6.
