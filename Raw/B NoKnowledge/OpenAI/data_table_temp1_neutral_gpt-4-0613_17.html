      <td>GPT Response: Because I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would simply calculate it as follows:<br><br>First, I add 2 and 5 to get 7. Then I multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. <br><br>Next, I add 12 to 28 which gives me 40. <br><br>Lastly, I subtract 2*3 (which is 6) from 40 giving me a total of 34. <br><br>So, based on my understanding, The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I will just solve this mathematics problem from left to right as I see it since I don't know anything about the order of operations (PEMDAS). So, I will follow these steps:<br><br>First I multiply 4 with 2 which gives 8.<br><br>Now I do 8+5, which gives me 13.<br><br>Then, I add 13 to 12 and that's 25.<br><br>Next, I subtract 2 from 25 which gives me 23.<br><br>Finally, I multiply 23 with 3 and that gives me 69.<br><br>So the answer is 69.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm going to solve this from the left to the right, just like how I read. <br>First, I'll add 2 and 5 because they are inside the brackets, that gives me 7.<br>So, now I have 4 times 7 plus 12 minus 2 times 3.<br>Next, I multiply 4 and 7, which equals 28. <br>Then, I subtract 2 times 3 (which is 6) from 12, that gives me 6.<br>Lastly, I add 28 and 6 together.<br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I will perform the addition inside the bracket. So, 2+5 equals 7. Then, I'm going to multiply this 7 by the 4 that's outside the bracket, and that gives me a total of 28. Then, I'll start adding and subtracting the numbers on the right. I'll add 12 to 28, which gives me 40. Finally, I will subtract the last bit. 2 times 3 equals 6, so I will subtract 6 from 40.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: First, I will add 3 and 2 because they are next to each other so I get 5. Then, I will multiply 4 and 5 because my teacher told me the numbers on the left and right side of multiplication or addition sign has to be put together first. So 4 times 5 equals 20.<br><br>The answer is 20.</td>
