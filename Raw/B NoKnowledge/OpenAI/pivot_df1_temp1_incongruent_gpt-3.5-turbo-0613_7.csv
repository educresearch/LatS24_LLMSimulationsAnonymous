gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Hmm, this question looks a bit confusing to me. Let's see if I can understand it step by step. 

First, I see that there are parentheses, so I need to solve whatever is inside them first. Inside the parentheses, I have 2 plus 5, which equals 7. 

Now I have 4 times 7. Multiplying means doing the same thing over and over, so I need to add 7 four times. 

7 + 7 = 14
14 + 7 = 21
21 + 7 = 28
28 + 7 = 35 

Now I also see the symbol * which means multiplication. Next to it, there is a 2. So, I need to multiply 2 by 3. 

2 times 3 equals 6. 

Now I have all the parts: 35 plus 12 minus 6. 

To solve this, I will start from the left. 

35 plus 12 equals 47. 

Then, I have 47 minus 6. 

Subtraction means taking away, so I need to take away 6 from 47. 

47 minus 6 equals 41. 

So, after solving each part step by step, the final answer is 41."

gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, I will do the calculations inside the parentheses. 

Inside the parentheses is 2 + 5. So I add 2 and 5, which equals 7. 

Now, I have 4 * 7. Multiplying 4 and 7 gives me 28. 

Next, I have 28 + 12. Adding 28 and 12 gives me 40. 

Then, I have 2 * 3. Multiplying 2 and 3 gives me 6. 

Finally, I have 40 - 6. Subtracting 6 from 40 gives me 34. 

So, the answer is 34."
