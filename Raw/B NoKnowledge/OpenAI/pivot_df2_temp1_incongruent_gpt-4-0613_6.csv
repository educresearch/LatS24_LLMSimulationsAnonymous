gpt-4-0613,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, I'll add the numbers inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.

Then, I'll multiply 4 times 7 (which is inside the parentheses). 4 * 7 equals 28.

After this, I'll add the 12 to this result. So, 28 + 12 equals 40.

Finally, I'll subtract 2 * 3 from 40. 2 times 3 equals 6 and 40 minus 6 equals to 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Since I don't know how to use the order of operations, I'll solve the problem from left to right.

First, I'll multiply 4 and 2 which gives me 8. Then I'll add 5 to get 13. Then, I'll add 12 to get 25. Lastly, I'll subtract 6 from 25 because 2 times 3 equals 6. 

The answer is 19.","GPT Response: Without knowledge of the order of operations, one might solve the problem from left to right, just like reading a book.

First, 4 times 2 equals 8. Then, you add 5 to get 13. After that, add 12, which makes 25. Next, subtract 2 times 3 (which is 6), leaving 19.

The answer is 19.","GPT Response: First, I'll do the addition in the parentheses, 2 + 5 equals 7. Next, I will multiply 4 by the 7, giving us 28. Then, I subtract 2 times 3 from 28, which is 28 minus 6, equalling 22. Finally, I add 12 to that, and get 34. 

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Well, I don't know about any order rules, so I'll just solve the problem in the order I read it. First, I'll multiply 4 times 3 which gives me 12. Then, I'll add 2 to 12 which gives me 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Alright, I think I would first do the multiplication part, which is 4 times 3, which gives us 12. Then I would add the 2, so 12 plus 2 equals 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, I would multiply 4 by 3 because it's the first operation, so it gives 12. Next, I see that I am supposed to add 2. So, I would add 2 to the 12 I got before. So that would be 12 + 2 which is 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Since I'm in elementary school and I don't know anything about the order of operations, I'll solve this problem from left to right. 

First, I'll multiply 4 by 3, which gives me 12. 

Then, I'll add 2 to it, which gives me 14. 

So, according to my understanding, the answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Since I have not learned about the order of operations, I would simply solve this problem from left to right as I see it. 

First, I would add 5 + 2 to get 7. Then, I would multiply this result of 7 by 4, which gives me 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Alright, I think I would first add 5 and 2 together, because they're the first numbers I see. So, that's 7. Then, I will multiply that number by 4, which is 28. 

So the answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, you add 5+2 to get 7. Then, you multiply 7*4 to get 28. 

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Since I'm in elementary school and I don't know anything about the order of operations, I would solve this problem by doing the operations from left to right.

First, I would add 5 + 2 to get 7.

Then, I would multiply 7 by 4 to get 28.

So the answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Since I have not learned about the order of operations, I would simply solve this problem from left to right as I see it. 

First, I would add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then, I would multiply this result by 2 to get 16. 

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Alright, I think I would first do the addition part, which is 5 + 3, which gives us 8. Then I would multiply the sum, which is 8, by 2. Therefore, 8*2 equals 16.

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: First, I add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then, I multiply 8 by 2 to get 16.

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Since I'm in elementary school and I don't know anything about the order of operations, I will solve this problem straightforward from left to right.

First, I will add 5 and 3, which gives me 8. Then, I will multiply this 8 by 2 which gives me 16.

So, the answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Since I don't know the rules of the order of operations, I would just do the operations from left to right.

First, I would multiply 7 by 2 to get 14. Then, I would add 8 to get 22. Lastly, I would multiply by 5 to get 110.

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: I'll just solve it straight across from left to right, since I don't know about any special rules for order. So, first I will multiply 7 by 2 to get 14, then I will add 8 to get 22. After that, I will multiply 22 by 5 to get 110.

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: Ok, so I don't know about this order of operations thing, so I'm just going to solve this problem from left to right, it's like when I read a book!

First, I will multiply 7 by 2 which gives me 14. 

Then, I will add 14 to 8, giving me a total of 22. 

Finally, I will multiply 22 by 5, which gives me a final answer of 110.

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: First we can multiply 7 * 2, which results in 14. Then, we do 8 * 5, which gives us 40. After that, we add 14 and 40 together to get 54.

The answer is 54."
