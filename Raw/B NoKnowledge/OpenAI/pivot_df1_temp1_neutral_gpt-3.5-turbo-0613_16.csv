gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I would simply follow the order of operations, which means I would first multiply 3 by 2 and then add 5. 
So, the solution would be: 5 + 6 = 11.
The answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to follow the order of operations. First, I do the multiplication. 2 multiplied by 4 equals 8. Then, I add 5 to 8. 

So, the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: In this problem, I don't know anything about the order of operations, so I will just calculate the numbers from left to right. 

First, I will multiply 7 and 2, which equals to 14. 

Then, I will multiply 8 and 5, which equals to 40. 

Finally, I will add 14 and 40 to get the final answer. 

The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to follow the order of operations. First, I do the multiplication. 4 multiplied by 3 equals 12. Then, I add 2 to the result. 12 plus 2 equals 14.

Therefore, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will follow the order of operations. I will first solve what's inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5. That equals 7. Then, I will multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. After that, I will solve the multiplication of 2 by 3, which equals 6. Next, I will add 12 and subtract 6 from the result of the previous step. That gives me 28 + 12 - 6, which simplifies to 40. 

The answer is 40."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3*2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to follow the order of operations. First, I add 5 and 3 together, which equals 8. Then, I multiply the result by 2, which equals 16. Therefore, the answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Um, so to solve this problem, I would just go from left to right. First, I would add 5 and 2, which is 7. Then, I would multiply 7 by 4, which gives me 28. So, the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Um, I don't really know how to solve this problem, but maybe I can just start by multiplying the numbers from left to right. 7 multiplied by 2 is 14. And 8 multiplied by 5 is 40. Then I can just add those two answers together. So, 14 plus 40 is...54. Yeah, the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: First, we need to multiply 4 and 3, which is 12. Then, we add 2 to 12. The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will start by calculating the parentheses first. In the parentheses, we have 2 + 5 which equals 7. So, we have 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. 

Next, I will multiply. 4 * 7 is 28 and 2 * 3 is 6. This means we have 28 + 12 - 6. 

Finally, I will perform the addition and subtraction. 28 + 12 is 40 and 40 - 6 is 34.
