gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Oh, my older sister mentioned something about this! She said there's something called PEMDAS, which is like a rule for which math thing you should do first. So P is for Parentheses - you do that first. Then E is for Exponents, but there aren't any exponents here. Then M and D are for Multiplication and Division, and you do those next from left to right. Last, A and S are for Addition and Subtraction, from left to right too.

So, first, we do what's in parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

Then we do the multiplication and division from left to right. So, there are two multiplications here:

4 * (the 7 we just found) = 28
and
2 * 3 = 6

Now we replace those in the original equation:
28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So, after following what my sister said, I think the answer is 34.","GPT Response: Oh, I've just learned about this! We have to do the math in a certain order so everyone gets the same answer. The order is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and then Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). We can remember this order with the acronym PEMDAS.

So first, we solve whatever is in the parentheses. (2+5), which is 7.

Now the expression looks like this:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we do the multiplication and division from left to right. We have two multiplication operations: 4 * 7 and 2 * 3.
4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now our expression is:
28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, we do addition and subtraction from left to right:
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: Okay, so I'm not too sure about fancy rules for doing math problems, but I can try to figure this out by doing what seems to make sense. First, I see that there's a plus sign inside the parentheses, and I've been told to always do what's in the parentheses first.

So first, I'll add 2 and 5 together because of the parentheses:
2 + 5 equals 7.

Now the problem looks like this:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, even though I don't know specific rules, I can work from left to right just like when I read. So first I'll multiply 4 and 7 because that comes next:
4 times 7 equals 28.

Now the question looks like:
28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I’ll go on to the next part which is adding 28 and 12, because that's the next thing in the line:
28 + 12 equals 40.

The question is now:
40 - 2 * 3

I'm still going to follow my left to right idea, so I'll subtract 2 from 40 first:
40 - 2 equals 38.

But oh wait, there’s also this 2 times 3 I still need to do. Hmm, let’s multiply 2 and 3:
2 times 3 equals 6.

So I subtracted too early! Uh-oh. Well, I'll just subtract 6 from 38 since 2 times 3 is 6:
38 - 6 equals 32.

Okay, I'm thinking my final answer, even though I’m not sure about the rules, should be:
The answer is 32.","GPT Response: Okay, let's see! First, I think you do the stuff in the parentheses. So that would be 2+5 which is 7. Then I'm gonna replace that in the problem. Now it looks like 4*7+12-2*3. 

After that, I think we do times and divide before plus and minus, so I do 4 times 7 which is 28, and 2 times 3 which is 6. Now the problem looks like this: 28+12-6.

Now I just add and subtract in the order they come. So 28 plus 12 is 40, and then take away 6 makes 34!

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Oh, I just learned this! My teacher said there's a special order we have to use when we solve math problems, like a road map so we don't get lost. So, first, we have to do multiplication and division from left to right, and then we do addition and subtraction from left to right.

So looking at 4*3+2, we have to do the multiplication part first.

4 times 3 is 12.

Now we add the 2.

12 + 2 is 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve 4*3+2, I would do the multiplication part first because I think that seems right. So, 4 times 3 is 12. Then I would add 2 to 12, because that comes after the multiplication. So, 12 plus 2 is 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Um, I think you just do the math from left to right like when you read! So first you do 4 times 3 which is 12, and then you add 2 to it. So that's 12 plus 2 which is 14!

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: You just do the problem from left to right like reading a book. So first you do the 4 times 3 which is 12, and then you add 2 to 12. That makes 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Oh, I just learned this! My teacher said there's a special order we have to use when we solve math problems, like a road map so we don't get lost. It's like PEMDAS! That stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). It's like a rule that helps us know what to do first.

So looking at this problem 5+2*4, there are no parentheses or exponents, so I skip to multiplication and division. The problem has 2*4, so I do that part first. 2 times 4 equals 8.

Then, all I have left is the addition part, which is 5 + 8, and that equals 13!

So, the answer is 13.","GPT Response: To solve 5 + 2 * 4, we need to follow the correct steps. Even though I just learned about this thing called order of operations, I'm not completely clear on it. I think I remember my teacher saying that we need to do multiplication before addition. So first, we multiply 2 by 4.

2 * 4 is 8.

Now we add that to 5.

5 + 8 is 13.

So, the answer is 13.","GPT Response: Um, I think you just do the adding and the times-ing (multiplying) in the order you see them. So, first you do the 5 plus 2, which is like 7, right? And then you take that 7 and times it by 4. So 7 times 4 is like when you have four groups of seven things. If I count that up, that's 7, 14, 21, 28. So, I think the answer is 28. 

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: When you see a problem like 5+2*4, you have to do the multiplication part before you do the addition. So, you first calculate 2 times 4 which is 8, and then you add that to 5. 

So it goes like this:
First you do 2 * 4 = 8
Then you add that to 5, so it’s 5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Oh, I just learned this! My teacher said there's a special rule for the order we should do math problems like this. It's called ""PEMDAS,"" which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). So, we have to do any multiplication or division before we do addition or subtraction.

Looking at the problem 5 + 3 * 2, there aren't any parentheses or exponents, so we don't need to worry about those. The next thing in PEMDAS is multiplication, so we do 3 times 2 first, which gives us 6. Then, we add that result to 5.

So, 3 * 2 equals 6, and then 5 + 6 equals 11.

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: To solve 5 + 3 * 2, we need to follow the correct steps. Even though I just learned about this thing called order of operations which tells us to do multiplication before addition.

First, we do the multiplication part:

3 * 2 = 6

Then we add that result to 5:

5 + 6 = 11

So, the answer is 11.","GPT Response: Um, I think you just do the adding and the times in the order they show up. So you go 5 plus 3 is 8, then 8 times 2 is 16. So that's it, right? The answer is 16.","GPT Response: When you see a problem with addition and multiplication, you do the multiplication part first and then the addition. So here, we multiply 3 times 2 first which is 6, and then we add the 5. 

So, 5 + 3 * 2 becomes 5 + 6 when we do the multiplication first. Now we can add:

5 + 6 equals 11. 

The answer is 11."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Oh, I just learned this! We have to do the multiplication parts before we do addition. So I'll do the 7 times 2 first, and then the 8 times 5 next.

Okay, so 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40.

Now, I just have to add those two up. So 14 plus 40 is 54.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: To solve the expression 7*2+8*5 without knowing the order of operations, I just do the operations from left to right. 

First, I multiply 7 by 2, which gives me 14. Then I add that to 8 times 5. So next I multiply 8 by 5 to get 40. 

Finally, I add 14 and 40 together to get 54. 

Therefore, the answer is 54.","GPT Response: I think you just do the math from left to right like reading a sentence! So first you do 7 times 2 which is 14, and then you add 8 which gives you 22, and then times 5 at the end. So it’s like:

7 * 2 = 14
14 + 8 = 22
22 * 5 = 110

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: To solve the math problem 7 times 2 plus 8 times 5, I will do the multiplications first and then the addition just like in my homework.

So first I'm going to multiply 7 by 2, which is 14. And then, I'll multiply 8 by 5, which gives me 40.

Then all I need to do is add those two numbers together. So I add 14 and 40. Adding ten to fourteen makes 24, and then I add the thirty to get 64.

The answer is 64."
