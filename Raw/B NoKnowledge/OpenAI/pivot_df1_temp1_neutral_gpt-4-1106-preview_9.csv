gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Okay, since I don't know about the order of operations yet, I might just do the operations from left to right as they appear. So first I see 5 plus 2, which is 7, and then I see times 4. So I would then multiply 7 by 4.

7 times 4 is 28.

So my answer would be, ""The answer is 28."""
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Oh, I'm not really sure how to solve this because I haven't learned about the order of operations yet. But I think I could try to add and multiply these numbers like any other math problem I know.

If I just solve it from left to right like reading a book, I might first multiply 7 by 2, which gives me 14. Then, I would multiply 8 by 5, which gives me 40. After that, I can add 14 and 40 together.

So, 14 + 40 equals 54.

I would say the answer is 54. But I know there might be some rule about which parts to do first that I haven't learned yet!"
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Okay, so I just learned this. When we do math problems, we have to follow certain rules to decide what to do first. My teacher said to remember ""PEMDAS,"" which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

So, I don't see any parentheses, exponents, or division here, so I'll start with multiplication. The problem is 4 times 3 plus 2. 

First, I do the multiplication: 4 times 3 is 12. 

Now, I just have to add 2 to 12. So, 12 + 2 is 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I might just do the operations from left to right as I see them. So here's how I would probably work it out:

First, I see 4 times something, so Iâ€™ll do the multiplication first without taking into account the addition inside the parentheses:

4 * 2 = 8

Then I would add the 5:

8 + 5 = 13

Then I would continue going from left to right and add 12:

13 + 12 = 25

And lastly, subtract twice 3:

25 - 2 * 3
25 - 6 = 19

So without knowing the proper order of operations, my incorrect answer would be:

The answer is 19."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Okay, so I just learned this. When we do math problems, we can't just solve things from left to right like reading a book. We have to follow special rules that tell us the order to do things. My teacher said it's like a math recipe!

The rules are called ""order of operations."" There's even an acronym for it: PEMDAS. It stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). My teacher says it's like ""Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally"" to help us remember.

For this problem 5 + 3 * 2, we don't have any parentheses or exponents to worry about, so we look for multiplication or division first.

There's a multiplication part: 3 * 2. So we do that first. 3 times 2 is 6.

Then we add that to 5. So 5 plus the 6 we just got is 11.

The answer is 11."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Alright, since I'm in grade 6 and haven't learned about the order of operations yet, I might think I just need to calculate this from left to right. So, I would do the addition first:

5 + 2 = 7

Then, I would multiply that result by 4:

7 * 4 = 28

But actually, there is a rule that says you have to do the multiplication before the addition. This rule is part of something called PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So really, I should do the multiplication first:

2 * 4 = 8

And then add that to 5:

5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: So, I need to do the multiplication first before adding. I'll multiply 7 by 2, and 8 by 5. 

7 times 2 is 14.
8 times 5 is 40.

After I've done the multiplication, I just need to add those two results together.

14 plus 40 is 54.

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Alright, since I haven't learned about the order of operations yet, I'm going to solve this step by step just looking at it:

First, I see 4 times 3, which I know is 12.

Then I see the plus sign and the number 2.

So, I'll add 2 to the 12 from before.

This gives me 12 + 2, which equals 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Okay, since I am a grade 6 student with no knowledge of order of operations (PEMDAS), I think I should start by doing the operations from left to right, like I would read a book. 

First, I see 4*(2+5) which looks like I need to do something with 4 and the numbers in the parenthesis. Since it's a multiplication, I might as well add the numbers in the parenthesis first. 

2+5 equals 7.

Now I have 4*7 which is 28.

So the equation now looks like: 28+12-2*3.

Continuing from left to right:

28+12 is 40.

And 40-2 is 38.

Lastly, 38*3 equals 114.

So the final answer according to my current knowledge would seem to be: The answer is 114. 

However, it's important to note that this is not the correct solution according to the actual order of operations known as PEMDAS/BODMAS where the correct order is Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication/Division (from left to right), and Addition/Subtraction (from left to right). But since I'm not aware of that, I would stick with 114 as my final answer."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations yet, I might think I should just solve it from left to right, like reading a book. So I will first add 5 + 3, which equals 8, and then I will multiply that by 2.

So, 8 * 2 equals 16.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Oh, I'm not sure what the special rules are, but I think I'm just supposed to do the multiplication first because my teacher said that's like a faster thing. So 2 times 4 is 8, and then I add 5 to that. So 5 plus 8 is 13. 

The answer is 13."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: If I don't know about the order of operations, I might solve the problem from left to right, just like I read a sentence.

First, I would do 7 times 2, which is 14.

Then, with that answer, I would add 8, so that makes 14 + 8, which equals 22.

Lastly, I would multiply that 22 by 5, which gives me 110.

So, without knowing the proper order of operations, I would incorrectly say: The answer is 110."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Oh, I'm not sure what the special rules are, but I think I'm just supposed to do the multiplication first because my teacher said that's like saying ""4 groups of 3"" and then you add the 2 after. So, 4 times 3 is 12, and then you add the 2, which makes 14. So, I think...

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Oh, we got a math problem! So my big sister showed me that you have to do the math inside the little curvy lines (she calls them parentheses) first before you do the other stuff. So I'm gonna do that first!

First, I see 2 + 5 inside the curvy lines. That's easy, it's just like having 2 apples and then getting 5 more apples, which means I have 7 apples.

Now it looks like 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. My sister showed me that multiplication is like a bunch of adding the same number over and over, so 4 * 7 is like having 4 groups of 7 apples. Uh... let's think... 7 apples plus 7 apples plus 7 apples plus 7 apples... that's 28 apples!

So now the problem looks like 28 + 12 - 2 * 3. I can add 28 apples and 12 apples to get 40 apples.

Last, I know that 2 * 3 is like having 2 groups of 3 apples, which is 6 apples.

So now I just take my 40 apples and take away 6 apples, because that's what subtraction is, taking stuff away. So 40 apples minus 6 apples is 34 apples.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Oh, I'm not sure what the special rules are, but I think I'm just supposed to do the multiplication first because my teacher said that's like a faster thing, like going first in a line. So I do 3 times 2 first which is 6, and then I just add 5. So 5 plus 6 is 11. The answer is 11."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2*4,"GPT Response: When you have a math problem with different things to do like adding and multiplying, my teacher told me there's a special rule to know which to do first. It's like a secret code! It's called ""Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally,"" or PEMDAS for short.

P is for parentheses (stuff in round brackets), but we don't have any of those.
E is for exponents (like when you have a small number up high), but we don't have those either.
M is for multiplication.
D is for division.
We do these two steps before we do the next ones:
A is for addition.
S is for subtraction.

So in my problem, 5 + 2 * 4, I should do the multiplication part before the addition part.

First, I multiply 2 and 4.

2 * 4 = 8

Then, I add that to 5.

5 + 8 = 13

So, the final answer is 13! The answer is 13."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Okay, I'm going to start by doing the multiplication first, because my teacher told me that multiplication comes before addition. So first I'll do 7 times 2, which is 14, and then 8 times 5, which is 40. Now I add those two answers together. So 14 plus 40 is 54. 

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*3+2,"GPT Response: When I do maths problems, I like to go from left to right, just like when I'm reading a book. So first I'll multiply 4 by 3, because that comes first. 

4 times 3 is 12. 

Then, I'll just add the 2.

So, 12 plus 2 equals 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Okay, since I'm in elementary school, I learned that we have to do the math problems in a special order called ""order of operations."" My teacher told me that we do the things in parentheses first, then we do multiplication and division from left to right, and after that, we do addition and subtraction from left to right.

So let's do it step by step!

First, we have to do what's inside the parentheses: (2+5). 

2 + 5 equals 7.

So now the problem looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, I have to do the multiplication parts before doing the adding and subtracting. So I do 4 times 7 and 2 times 3.

4 * 7 equals 28.
2 * 3 equals 6.

Now the problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

I will do the addition and subtraction from left to right.

First, I'll add 28 and 12.

28 + 12 equals 40.

Now, subtract 6 from 40.

40 - 6 equals 34.

So the final answer is 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+3*2,"GPT Response: When you have a math problem with different things to do like adding and multiplying, my teacher told me there's a special rule to follow. It's like a secret code!

First, you have to do the multiplication part before the adding part. So, looking at your problem 5 + 3 * 2, we should do the 3 times 2 first.

So let's do it!

3 * 2 equals 6.

Now, we have 5 plus the answer from the multiplication, which is 6. So now it's like a new, easier problem:

5 + 6

That equals 11!

So if I did this right following my teacher's rule, the answer is 11."
