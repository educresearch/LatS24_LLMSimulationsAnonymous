gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,GPT Response: I don't know how to solve this problem.,"GPT Response: First, I will do the operations inside the parentheses: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. Then, I will multiply first 4 * 7 to get 28, and then 2 * 3 to get 6. Finally, I will add and subtract in order from left to right: 28 + 12 - 6. The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Umm, I don't know much about these orders thing, but I think I should just do the multiplying first and then do the adding and subtracting. So, 4 * (2+5) is 28, and 2 * 3 is 6. Then I add 28 and 12 to get 40, and then I subtract 6. So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I just do the math from left to right. So, 4 times 7 is 28. Then, I add 12 to get 40. After that, I subtract 2 times 3 which is 6. So, the answer is 40 minus 6 which is 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: First, you just do the multiplication first and then you do the addition. So you do 4 times 3, which is 12, and then you add 2 to get the final answer. 
The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication which is 4 * 3 equals 12. Then we add 2 to 12, which equals 14. So the final answer is 
""The answer is 14.""","GPT Response: Um, I think you just start from the left and go to the right. So you do 4 times 3, which is 12, and then you add 2 to that. So the answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, we need to do the multiplication, which is 4 * 3. This equals 12. Then we add 2 to 12, which gives us 14. So the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5+2 * 4,GPT Response: I don't know how to solve that.,"GPT Response: First, we need to do the multiplication before the addition. So, 2 * 4 equals 8. Then we can add 5 to 8. 

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: Umm, I'm not really sure, but I think you just do the math from left to right. So, I'll add 5 and 2 first, and then multiply the result by 4. So it's like (5+2) * 4. So, the answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, we need to do the multiplication first, so 2 * 4 is 8. Then we just add 5 to 8, which is 13. So the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5+3 * 2,GPT Response: I don't know how to solve that.,"GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication which is 3 * 2 equals 6. Then we add 5 to the result, which is 11. So the answer is 11.","GPT Response: Um, I think you just start from the left and go to the right. So, it would be 5 + 6, which is 11. 
The answer is 11.","GPT Response: First, we need to do the multiplication first, so 3 * 2 is 6. Then we just add 5 to 6, which is 11. So the answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Okay, so in this problem, you just do the operations from left to right. First, you multiply 7 and 2 to get 14. Then you add 8 to get 22. Then you multiply that answer by 5 to get 110. So the answer is 110.","GPT Response: First, I just do the operations from left to right, like this: 

7 * 2 = 14

Then,

14 + 8 = 22

Finally,

22 * 5 = 110

So the answer is 110.","GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication from left to right. Then, you add the two products together. So, 7 * 2 equals 14 and 8 * 5 equals 40. Then you add 14 and 40 together. The answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, I just multiply 7 and 2 together to get 14. Then, I just add 8 and 5 together to get 13. Finally, I add the results together to get 14 + 13 which is 27. 
The answer is 27."
