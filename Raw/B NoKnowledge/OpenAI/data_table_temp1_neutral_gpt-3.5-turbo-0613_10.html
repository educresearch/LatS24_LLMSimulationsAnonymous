      <td>GPT Response: First, we need to solve the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we add 2 and 5, which equals 7. So now the problem looks like this: 4*7+12-2*3.<br><br>Next, we need to perform the multiplications. We multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28, and we multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. Now the problem is: 28+12-6.<br><br>Finally, we can perform the additions. We add 28 and 12, which equals 40, and then subtract 6. So the final answer is 40-6.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we follow the order of operations called "PEMDAS". P stands for parenthesis, E stands for exponents or powers, MD stands for multiplication and division (from left to right), and AS stands for addition and subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>In this equation, there are no parentheses or exponents. So, we move to the multiplication and division part. Since there's only one operation, which is multiplication, we perform it first.<br><br>4 * 3 = 12<br><br>After performing the multiplication, we move to the addition and subtraction part.
