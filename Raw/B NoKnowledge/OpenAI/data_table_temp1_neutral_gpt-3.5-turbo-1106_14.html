      <td>GPT Response: I don't know how to solve this using order of operations.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses. 2+5 equals 7. <br><br>Then, we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28.<br><br>Next, we do the operations outside the parentheses. We multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6.<br><br>Afterwards, we add 12 and 6, which equals 18.<br><br>Finally, we add 28 and 18, which equals 46.<br><br>So, the answer is 46.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Umm, so first you do what's inside the parentheses, which is 2+5. That's 7. Then you multiply 4 by 7 and get 28. After that, you do the multiplication of 2 by 3, which is 6. Then you just add 12 and subtract 6. So the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we can add the numbers inside the parentheses:<br>4*(2+5) + 12 - 2*3<br>= 4*(7) + 12 - 2*3<br>= 28 + 12 - 2*3<br>= 40 - 2*3<br>Next, we do the multiplication:<br>40 - 2*3<br>= 40 - 6<br>Finally, we do the subtraction:<br>40 - 6<br>= 34<br>So the answer is 34.</td>
