      <td>GPT Response: Since I am a sixth grader and I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would solve the problem from left to right, like how I read.<br><br>First, I would do the multiplication: 4 * 2 equals 8. <br><br>Second, I would do the addition: 8 + 5 equals 13.<br><br>Third, I would do the addition again: 13 + 12 equals 25.<br><br>Finally, I would do the multiplication and subtraction: 25 - 2 * 3 equals 19.<br><br>The answer is 19.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I'll do the addition: 2+5 equals 7, making the problem look like this: 4*7+12-2*3. <br><br>Next, I know that multiplication comes before addition and subtraction, so I'll do those operations next: 4*7 equals 28 and 2*3 equals 6, making the problem 28+12-6.<br><br>Then, I'll do the subtraction. 12-6 equals 6: so now the question is 28+6.<br><br>Finally, I'll add the two numbers together. 28+6 equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, let's do the addition and subtraction from left to right. <br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3 = 28 + 12 - 6 = 40 - 6 = 34. <br>Afterward, we do the multiplication. 34 * 3 = 102.<br>So the answer is 102.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so first I will add the numbers in the parentheses which are 2+5. That's, umm, let me think... it's 7. After that, I have this: 4 * 7+12-2 * 3. So, then I just do all the calculations from left to right like how we read!<br>So, 4 * 7 is 28. My math problem now looks like this: 28+12-2*3.<br>Next I add 28 + 12 and um, that's 40. So, now it's like 40 - 2 * 3.<br>Then I subtract, 40 - 2 equals to 38. And finally, I can just multiply 38 * 3, which is... um... 114!<br>So, the answer is 114!</td>
