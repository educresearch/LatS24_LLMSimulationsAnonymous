systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will follow the order of operations. First, I have to solve everything inside the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, I have 2 + 5 which equals 7. Then, I have to multiply 4 by 7 which equals 28. Next, I add 12 to 28 which equals 40. Then, I have to multiply 2 by 3 which equals 6. Finally, I have to subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34.
So, the answer is 34."
