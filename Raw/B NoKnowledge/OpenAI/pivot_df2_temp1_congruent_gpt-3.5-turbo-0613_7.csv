gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this math problem, we need to follow the order of operations which is PEMDAS. The ""P"" stands for parentheses, ""E"" stands for exponents, ""M"" stands for multiplication, ""D"" stands for division, ""A"" stands for addition, and ""S"" stands for subtraction.
In this problem, we have multiplication and addition.
First, we need to do the multiplication which is 4 multiplied by 3. This equals 12.
Then, we add 2 to the result. 12 + 2 equals 14.
So the answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we will follow the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS. This stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Given the expression 4*3 + 2, there are no parentheses or exponents in the expression, so we move on to the next step.

Next, we perform the multiplication operation. Multiplication comes before addition, so we calculate 4*3, which equals 12.

Finally, we perform the addition operation. We take the result of the multiplication (12) and add 2 to it.

Therefore, the answer is 12 + 2 = 14.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will add 4 times 3, which equals 12. Then I will add 2, which equals 14. 
The answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will start by multiplying 4 and 3, which equals 12. Then, I will add 2 to the product, which equals 14. 
The answer is 14."
