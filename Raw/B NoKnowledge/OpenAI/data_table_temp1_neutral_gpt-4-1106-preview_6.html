      <td>GPT Response: Oh boy, this looks like a tricky puzzle! I heard someone mention that when you have numbers and signs like this, there's a special set of rules for which parts you do first, kind of like a game. I remember my older sibling mentioning something like "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally," which is supposed to help remember the steps. Hmm, I think the P stands for parentheses, so maybe that means I do the stuff inside those curved lines first.<br><br>So, I'll add the numbers inside the parentheses first. That's 2 + 5, which equals 7. Now my problem looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, I think the E is for exponents, but there aren't any in this problem. So, I'll skip that.<br><br>The M is for multiplication, and I see two spots where I need to multiply. First is 4 * 7, which is 28, and second is 2 * 3, which is 6. Now my problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>I think the D is for division, but I don't have any division here, so I'll skip that too.<br><br>The A is for addition, and the S is for subtraction. I can do those last two steps in order. So, I'll add 28 + 12. That's 40. Then, I subtract 6 from 40, which is 34.<br><br>My new problem looks simple now: 34. That must be the answer!<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I'm not sure how to do this correctly, but I'll try my best!<br><br>You told me to use PEMDAS, which I don't know, but I've been told that I should do parentheses first. So, I will start with whatever is inside the parentheses:<br><br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>So now the math problem looks like this:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Then, I'll just go from left to right since I don't know the correct order. Multiplying first:<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br><br>So now it is:<br><br>28 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Then I'll add:<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>So now we have:<br><br>40 - 2 * 3<br><br>Then I'll subtract:<br><br>40 - 2 = 38<br><br>And now it's:<br><br>38 * 3<br><br>And finally, I'll multiply:<br><br>38 * 3 = 114<br><br>So if I do it this way, the answer is 114. But I think my teacher said something about doing multiplication before adding and subtracting. So if I try that, maybe it will be:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>First, I'll do both multiplications:<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>Now it's:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Next, do the addition and subtraction from left to right:<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>Hmm, so if I consider the multiplication first, the answer is 34. <br><br>Since I don't know the rules, I'm not sure which is correct. But since you asked for a final answer:<br>The answer might be 34 if we do the multiplication before addition and subtraction.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! So I'm not sure about special rules for the order of how to do things, but I'd probably just do what looks easiest first! I see some additions and multiplications, and subtraction too.<br><br>First, I see 4 times something, and that something is 2 plus 5. I think I need to figure out that part first because it's like a little math problem inside the bigger one:<br><br>2 + 5 equals 7<br><br>Now, I can replace that 2 + 5 with 7, so now it looks like this:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Then I would probably just go from left to right, because that's how I read! So I would do the multiplication first:<br><br>4 times 7 is 28<br><br>Now it's:<br><br>28 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I would do the addition, because it's the next thing as I go from left to right:<br><br>28 + 12 is 40<br><br>Now it looks like this:<br><br>40 - 2 * 3<br><br>Lastly, I'll do the subtraction and then the multiplication because that's the order they come in now:<br><br>40 minus 2 is 38<br><br>Finally, I multiply by 3:<br><br>38 * 3 is 114<br><br>So the way I did it, the answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Alright, so I'm not totally sure about all the rules, but I know we have to do the part inside the parentheses first. So, I'll start with that.<br><br>Inside the parentheses it says 2 + 5, which is 7.<br><br>Now we can replace the part inside the parentheses with 7, so the math problem now looks like this: 4*7 + 12 - 2*3<br><br>Then, I think we do the multiplying parts next before we do adding or subtracting.<br><br>So first, we have 4 times 7 which is 28.<br><br>Then, we also have 2 times 3 which is 6.<br><br>Now we can replace those multiplying parts with the answers, and the problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Now we just add and subtract from left to right.<br><br>28 plus 12 is 40, and then 40 minus 6 is 34.<br><br>So the final answer is 34.</td>

      <td>4*3+2</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh gosh, I'm not really sure what the proper steps are, but I think you just go from left to right, so I would do 4 times 3 first which is 12, and then I would add 2 to that, so it would be 12 + 2, which is 14. <br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I'll just work this out from left to right as I read it.<br><br>First, I see 4 multiplied by 3, which is 12. I know that multiplication is like adding a number several times, so I add 4 three times: 4 + 4 + 4, which equals 12.<br><br>Then I will add the last number, 2, to the result of the multiplication. So I take the 12 from before and add 2, which gives me 12 + 2 equals 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, so I think I should do the multiplication first because my teacher said that's like a really important rule. So, 4 times 3 is 12, and then I just have to add 2 to it. 12 plus 2 is 14. So I did the times thing first and then the plus.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh gosh, I'm not really sure what the proper steps are, but I think someone mentioned you might have to multiply before you add things together. So, maybe I'll try that?<br><br>First, I'd multiply 2 by 4 because that feels right, and that gives me 8.<br>Then, I'd take that 8 and add 5 to it, because I think you're supposed to do the times first?<br><br>So, if I add 5 to the 8 from the multiplication, that gives me 13.<br><br>I guess my answer would be, "The answer is 13."</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Alright, since I'm a 6th grader who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would do the operations from left to right.<br><br>First, I would add 5 + 2 which gives me 7.<br><br>Then, I'd multiply that result by 4, so 7 * 4 is 28.<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, so first I know that I need to add 5 plus 2 and then multiply by 4. So, 5 plus 2 is 7, and then I take 7 times 4 which is 28. So, the answer is 28.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh gosh, okay, so in math, I heard there's like a rule or something for figuring out what to do first when you have plus signs and times signs. I think my teacher said that you gotta do the multiplication part before the addition part. So, here, I would take the 3 times 2 first because multiplication is like a super-important math thingy that you do before adding.<br><br>Let's do that first:<br>3 times 2 is 6.<br><br>Now you just add that to 5:<br>5 plus 6 is 11.<br><br>So, if I did it right, the answer is 11.</td>
