gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Without knowing the order of operations, I might think that I should just compute the problem from left to right. So, let's do this: 

First, I'll add 5 + 2 which equals 7.

Then, I'll multiply 7 by 4. That equals 28.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: I'll just do the math left to right, like I read a book. First, I'll multiply 7 by 2 to get 14. Then, I add 8 to 14 to get 22. Finally, I multiply 22 by 5 to get 110.

The answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Without knowing the order of operations, I might think to solve the problem just from left to right. So first, I would multiply 4*3 to get 12, then add 2 to 12 to get 14. The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would simply solve this problem from left to right.

First, I multiply 4 by 2 which gives me 8. Then, I add 5 to 8 and I get 13. After that, I add 12 to 13 which gives me 25. Finally, I subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which is 6, from 25. 

The answer is 19."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Without knowing the order of operations, I might think that I should just compute the problem from left to right. So, I would first add 5 and 3 to get 8, and then multiply that by 2 to get 16. 

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Since I'm a grade 6 student with no understanding of the order of operations (PEMDAS), I'll solve the mathematical problem left to right, just like when I read a book. 

So, first, I'll add 5 and 2, which gives 7. Then, I'll multiply this 7 with 4, which gives 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Since I do not know about the order of operations, I will do the operations from left to right. 

First, I will multiply 7 by 2, which gives me 14

Then, I will add the 14 to 8, which gives 22

Finally, I will multiply 22 by 5, which gives me 110. 

The answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I will solve it from left to right. 

First, I multiply 4 by 3, which equals 12. Then, I add 12 to 2, which equals 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, I will add the numbers inside the parenthesis: 4*(2+5) becomes 4*7. Then, I will multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. 

Then, I have 28 + 12, which is 40.

Next, I will subtract 2 times 3 from 40. That's like subtracting 6 from 40. That gives me 34. 

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would simply solve this problem from left to right. First, I would add 5 + 3 to get 8. Then, I would multiply 8 by 2 to get 16.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Since I'm an elementary school student and I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would simply solve this problem from left to right because that's how I read and write things. So, I would first add 5 + 2, which gives me 7. Then, I would multiply the 7 by 4 to get 28 as the final answer.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Since I do not know about the order of operations, I'll just solve the operations in the way they appear.
First, I'll solve 7*2, which is 14.
Then I'll add 8 to 14, which is 22.
Finally, I'll multiply 22 by 5, which gives 110.

The answer is 110."

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Since I'm not familiar with the order of operations, I'll perform the operations as they appear from left to right.

First, 4 times 2 is 8. Then, I add 5 to 8 to get 13. Next, I add 12 to 13 which is 25. Lastly, I subtract 2 times 3 (which is 6) from 25 to get 19.

The answer is 19."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Since I'm an elementary school student and I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would simply solve this problem from left to right because that's how I read and write things.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2*4,"GPT Response: As an elementary school student who does not know about the order of operations in Mathematics, I would simply solve this problem from left to right.

First, I would add 5 + 2 giving me 7.
Then, I would multiply 7 by 4 to get 28.

How I calculated this is called the ""left-to-right"" method, which is how you generally read sentences. However, I am not aware yet that in mathematics, multiplication and division should be done before addition and subtraction.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Okay! As an elementary student with no knowledge of order of operations, I will just calculate it from left to right. 

First, 7 times 2 is 14. 

Next, 14 plus 8 is 22. 

Last, 22 times 5 is 110.

The answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*3+2,"GPT Response: As an elementary school student who does not know about the order of operations in Mathematics, I would simply solve this problem from left to right.

First, I would multiply 4 by 3 giving me 12.
Then, I would add 12 to 2, giving me 14. 
So, the answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, you add 2 and 5 because they are in parentheses which gives you 7. Then you multiply 4 and 7 to get 28. 

For the second part, you subtract 2 and 3 to get -1 because there are no rules for order of operations when there are only two numbers. But if you multiply -2 and 3 first, like you did for the 4 and the 2+5, you get -6.

Then you add these numbers: 28, 12, and -6. 

You get 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+3*2,"GPT Response: As an elementary school student who does not know about the order of operations, I will just calculate from left to right because that's how I usually read and do things. So first I'll add 5 and 3 to get 8, then I'll multiply 8 by 2 to get 16.

The answer is 16."
