gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Since I don't know the concept of order of operations, I'd go ahead to solve this problem from left to right.

Starting from the left, I multiply 4 with everything in the bracket, (2+5), which gives 28.

Next, I'd add the 12 to the 28, which gives 40.

Then, I'll move to the right and subtract 2 from 40 which gives 38.

Finally, I multiply 38 by 3, which gives 114.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: As a 6th grader who doesn't know about the order of operations, I might think of doing the math from left to right. So, I'd add 5 and 2 first to get 7, then multiply that by 4 to get 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: I'm not sure about the rules on how to solve this, but I can try. 

Let's solve it from left to right:
First, 7 times 2 is 14. 
Then, 14 plus 8 is 22. 
Lastly, if you times 22 by 5, it gives 110.

The answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: As a 6th grader who doesn't know about the order of operations, I might think of doing the math from left to right, just like reading. So, I would first do the multiplication 4 * 3 which equals 12. And then I would add 2 to the result which gives us 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, I will add 2 and 5 together because they're inside brackets. So, 2+5 is 7.

Then, I will multiply the result with 4. 4 * 7 is 28.

I also need to multiply 2 and 3. So, 2*3 is 6.

Now, I can use these results to add and subtract. I'll add 28 and 12 to get 40. Then I will subtract 6 from 40 which gives me 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: As a 6th grader who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would just solve the problem from left to right. 

First, I would add 5 and 3, which is 8. 

Then I would multiply that by 2, which is 16. 

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: As I don't know the order of operations, I would just follow the equation from left to right. 

First, I would add 5 and 2 getting a result of 7. Then, I would multiply this result by 4.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Since I'm not aware about the order of operations, I would simply perform these mathematical calculations from left to right. 

First, I would multiply 7 by 2, which equals 14. 

Then I would add 14 to 8, which equals 22. 

Lastly, I would multiply 22 by 5, which equals 110.

The answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: As an elementary school student who doesn't understand the order of operations, I would simply work from left to right. So, I would do the multiplication first, getting a result of 12. Then, I would add the 2, ending with a total of 14.

Therefore, The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Well, since I don't know about the order of operations, I'd go ahead and solve this from left to right just like a normal reading. First, I'll add 2 and 5 to get 7, then I'll multiply 4 by that to get 28. After that, I'll add 12 to get a total of 40. Finally, I'll subtract 2 and multiply the answer by 3 to get a final result of 114.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: To solve this question, first, I would multiply 7 by 2 which gives me 14. Then I would multiply 8 by 5 which gives me 40. Afterward, I would add the results together. Therefore, 14 plus 40 is 54.

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Sure, I know how to add and multiply, so let's solve this. First, we multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then, we add 2 to 12 to get 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, you add 2 and 5 because it's inside the parentheses, so that means you do it first. You get 7. Then, you multiply 4 and 7 because in the problem, you do the multiplication before you do anything else. That gives you 28. After that, you add 12 to 28 which is 40. Finally, you subtract 2 times 3, which is 6, from 40. So the final answer is 34. 

The answer is 34."
