gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will use the order of operations. The order of operations tells us to perform multiplication before addition. So, first, I will multiply 2 with 4, which gives me 8. Then, I will add 5 to 8. 

Therefore, the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Um, so I don't really know how to do this order of operations thing, but I guess I can try. I'll just do the operations in order from left to right, I think. So first, I'll multiply 7 and 2, which is 14. Then, I'll multiply 8 and 5, which is 40. Finally, I'll add those two answers together, so 14 + 40 is 54. Um, the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will use the order of operations. The order of operations tells us to perform the multiplication first, and then the addition. So first, I will multiply 4 and 3, which gives me 12. Then, I will add 2 to 12. The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, first, we need to perform the operations inside the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5 which equals 7. 
Then, we multiply 4 by 7, which gives us 28. 
Next, we add 12 to 28, which gives us 40. 
Finally, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which gives us 6. 
Therefore, the answer is 40 - 6 = 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will use the order of operations. The order of operations tells us to perform multiplication before addition. So, first, I will multiply 3 and 2, which gives me 6. Then, I will add 5 to 6.

gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 5+2*4, I will first multiply 2 and 4 because multiplication comes before addition. 
2 multiplied by 4 equals 8. 
Then, I will add 5 to 8. 
The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: In this problem, we are given the expression 7*2+8*5. Since I don't know anything about order of operations, I will just solve it from left to right. First, I will multiply 7 and 2, which equals 14. Then, I will multiply 8 and 5, which equals 40. Finally, I will add the results of the two multiplications: 14+40. Therefore, the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 4*3+2, I will first multiply 4 and 3, which gives me 12. Then, I will add 2 to the result, which gives me a final answer of 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will first calculate the value inside the parentheses, which is 2+5. That gives me a result of 7. Then, I will multiply 4 by 7, which is 28. Next, I will add 12 to 28, which gives me 40. Finally, I will subtract 2 multiplied by 3 from 40, resulting in 34. 

The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3*2,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 5+3*2, I will first multiply 3 and 2 because multiplication comes before addition. 
3*2 equals 6.
Then I will add 5 and 6 together.
5+6 equals 11.
So, the answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Hmm, this looks like a math problem! Let's try to solve it step by step. First, we see the addition symbol (+) between the numbers 5 and 2. So, we start by adding 5 and 2, which gives us 7. Then, we have a multiplication symbol (*) between 2 and 4. We know that multiplication means we have to do that operation next. So, 2 multiplied by 4 is 8. Finally, we put the two results together. The answer is 7 + 8, which gives us 15."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will first multiply 7 by 2 and get 14. Then, I will multiply 8 by 5 and get 40. Finally, I will add 14 and 40 together. 
So, the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to remember that we should do the multiplication before the addition. So, we first multiply 4 by 3, which is 12. Then, we add 2 to get the answer. 
Therefore, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, we need to perform the operations inside the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5, which is 7. 
Next, we multiply 4 by 7, which is 28. 
Then, we have to subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which is 6. 
Finally, we add 28 and 12, which is 40. 
So, the answer is 40."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I would start by adding 5 and 3 together, which equals 8. Then, I would multiply 8 by 2, which equals 16. So, the answer is 16."

gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. We start with the parentheses first, so we add 2 and 5, which gives us 7. Then we multiply 4 by the result, so we have 4 * 7 which equals 28. 
Next, we add 12 to 28, which gives us 40. 
Finally, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3 from 40. 
So the answer is 40 - (2 * 3) which is 40 - 6.
