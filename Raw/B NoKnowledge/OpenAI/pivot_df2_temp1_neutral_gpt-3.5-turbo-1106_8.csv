gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Um, I'm not really sure about this, but I think you just do the math from left to right. So first you do 4*(2+5), which is 4*7, and that's 28. Then you add 12 to get 40. After that, you do 2*3, which is 6. Finally, you subtract 6 from 40 to get 34. Um, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we need to do the operations inside the parentheses first. So, (2+5) equals 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. Next, we multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. After that, we add 12 and subtract 6 from 28. So, 28 + 12 - 6 equals 34. Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I do the math inside the parentheses, which is 2+5. That equals 7. Then I multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. After that, I add 12 to get 40.

gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Ummm, I think you just do the operations from left to right, like adding 4 times 3 first and then adding 2. So the answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, I multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then, I add 2 to 12 to get the final answer.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think we just do the multiplication first and then the addition. So, 4*3 is 12 and then we add 2, which is 14. So the answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, I do the multiplication which is 4*3. Then I add 2 to the result. So, 4*3 equals 12, and 12+2 equals 14. So the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Ummm, I think you just do the operations from left to right, like adding 5 and 2 first and then multiplying that result by 4. So, it would be 7 * 4. The answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, we multiply 2 and 4 to get 8. Then we add 5 to the result, which gives us 13. 
So, the answer is 13.","GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication, so it's 2*4 which equals 8. Then you do the addition, so it's 5+8. The answer is 13.","GPT Response: First, I add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then I multiply 7 by 4 to get 28. So the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication, so 3*2 equals 6. Then you add 5 to 6, which equals 11. So the answer is 11.","GPT Response: First, we multiply 3 and 2 to get 6. Then we add 5 to the result, which gives us 11. 
So, the answer is 11.","GPT Response: Um, I'm not totally sure, but I think we just do the math from left to right. So it's 5 plus 3 which is 8, and then times 2 is 16. So the answer is 16.","GPT Response: First, I add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then I multiply 8 by 2 to get 16. So the answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Umm, I'm not really sure what to do first, but my teacher always says to just do the operations from left to right. So I'll just do the multiplication first, and then the addition. 

So, 7*2 is 14 and 8*5 is 40. Then I add 14 and 40 together, which is 54.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, I multiply 7 and 2 to get 14. Then I multiply 8 and 5 to get 40. Finally, I add 14 and 40 to get 54. So, the answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, we multiply 7 and 2 to get 14. Then we multiply 8 and 5 to get 40. After that, we add 14 and 40 to get the final answer. The answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, you just solve the math from left to right. So first, you do 7 times 2 which is 14. Then you add 8 times 5 which is 40. So you'd have 14 plus 40 which is 54. 

The answer is 54."
