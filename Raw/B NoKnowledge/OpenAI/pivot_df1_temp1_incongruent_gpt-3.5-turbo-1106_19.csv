gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Umm, I don't really know how to do that order thing, but I'm just gonna do it from left to right. So, first I will add 5 and 2 to get 7, then I will multiply 7 by 4 to get 28. So, the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Hmm, I think I should just do the operations from left to right. 
7 * 2 is 14 
Then I add 8 to get 22
Now I have to do 8 * 5, which is 40
Finally, I add 22 + 40 and I get 62. 
So the answer is 62."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Umm, I don't really know how to do that, but I think I just multiply 4 and 3 first, and then add 2. So I do 4 * 3 which is 12, and then I add 2 which is 14. So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, I will add 2 and 5 together which equals 7. Then I will multiply 4 by 7 which equals 28. After that, I will multiply 2 by 3 which equals 6. Next, I will add 12 to 28 which equals 40. Finally, I will subtract 6 from 40 which equals 34. 
The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Umm, I don't really know how to do that, but I think I just do it from left to right. So, I'll just do 5 + 3 first, and then multiply the result by 2. So, it's 8 * 2. The answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Hmm, so I just need to do the operations from left to right. First, I add 5 and 2, so I get 7. Then, I multiply 7 by 4, which gives me 28. 
So, the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication before addition. So, 7 * 2 = 14 and 8 * 5 = 40. Then we add these products together to get the final answer. 

The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Hmm, so I just need to do the operations from left to right. First, I'll do the multiplication, which is 4 * 3 = 12. Then I'll add 2 to 12, so 12 + 2 = 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, I multiply 4 by (2+5) which is 4 * 7 = 28. Then, I just add 12 which is 28 + 12 = 40. After that, I subtract 2 times 3 which is 40 - 6 = 34. So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Hmm, I think I just need to go in order from left to right. So, I'll do 5 + 3 first, and then multiply the result by 2. 
5 + 3 is 8, and then 8 multiplied by 2 is 16. 
So, the answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Um, I think you just, like, do the math from left to right. So, you add 5 and 2 first to get 7, and then you multiply that by 4 to get 28. So, like, the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: First, I just solve from left to right. So, 7 times 2 is 14. Then I add 8 times 5, which is 40. So, the answer is 14 plus 40. The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Um, I think you just, like, do the multiplication first and, like, then just add. So, 4 times 3 is 12, and then you add 2 to that. So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses. So, 2+5 is 7. 
Then we multiply 4 by 7, which is 28. 
Next, we add 12 to 28, which gives us 40. 
Finally, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which is 6, from 40. 
So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Um, I think you just, like, do the math from left to right. So, it's like 5 plus 3 is 8, and then times 2, which is 16. So, like, the answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication before the addition. So 2 times 4 is 8. Then we add 5 to 8. The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: First, we just do the math from left to right without any special rules. So, 7 * 2 is 14, and 8 * 5 is 40. Then we just add those together: 14 + 40 is 54. 

So, the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: First, you need to do the multiplication and then the addition. So, 4 times 3 equals 12, and then when you add 2, you get 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, I'll solve what's in the parentheses. 2 + 5 is 7. Then, I'll calculate 4 times 7, which is 28. Next, I'll calculate 2 times 3, which is 6. Then, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So, 28 plus 12 is 40, and 40 minus 6 is 34. So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: First, we add 5 and 3 together, and then we multiply the result by 2.

5 + 3 = 8
8 * 2 = 16

The answer is 16."
