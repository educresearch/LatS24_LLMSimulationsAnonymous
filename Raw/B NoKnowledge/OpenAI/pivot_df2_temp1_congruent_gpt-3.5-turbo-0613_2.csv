gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I first need to simplify the parentheses. In the parentheses, I add 2 and 5 together to get 7. 

Next, I multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28.

Then, I need to solve the multiplication problems. I multiply 2 by 3 to get 6.

Finally, I perform the addition and subtraction from left to right. I add 12 to 28 to get 40, and then subtract 6 to get 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to use the order of operations which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).
First, I see there are parentheses, so I need to solve what is inside them first.
Inside the parentheses, I have 2 + 5 which is equal to 7.
Now, I have 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3 left.
Next, I need to solve the multiplication. 4 * 7 is equal to 28 and 2 * 3 is equal to 6.
Now, I have 28 + 12 - 6 left.
Lastly, I need to solve the addition and subtraction from left to right.
28 + 12 is equal to 40 and 40 - 6 is equal to 34.
Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: Um, okay, so in this problem we have some numbers and some operations. I think we should start with the things in parentheses first. So, inside the parentheses, we add 2 and 5 together. That gives us 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7. That gives us 28. 
Next, we have to do the multiplication and subtraction. So, I think we should do the multiplication first. We have 2 times 3, which is 6. 
Then, we have to add and subtract. We have 28 plus 12, which is 40. And then we subtract 6 from that, which gives us 34. 
So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. First, we do the calculations inside the parentheses. 2 + 5 equals 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. Next, we have addition and subtraction. We add 28 and 12 to get 40. Lastly, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3 from 40. 2 multiplied by 3 equals 6, so we subtract 6 from 40. 

The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. First, we multiply 4 and 3 together to get 12. Then, we add 2 to get the final answer. 

So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve the given problem, I first multiply 4 and 3 together, which gives me 12. Then, I add 2 to 12. 

So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, we need to follow the order of operations. We start by doing the multiplication first, so 4 multiplied by 3 is 12. Then, we add 2 to get the final answer. 

So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: So, to solve this problem, I just need to multiply 4 and 3 which is 12, and then add 2. 
So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. The first operation to do is the multiplication, so we multiply 2 by 4, which equals 8. Then, we add 5 to 8, which equals 13. 
Therefore, the answer is 13.","GPT Response: To solve the problem, I will calculate the multiplication first and then add the result to 5. 

First, I multiply 2 by 4, which equals 8. 

Then, I add 8 to 5. 

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: First, we need to follow the order of operations. We start by doing the multiplication first. So, 2 multiplied by 4 is equal to 8. 
Then, we add 5 to 8. 
So, the answer is 13.","GPT Response: First, I add 5 and 2, which equals 7. Then, I multiply 7 by 4, which equals 28. So the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. The first operation to do is the multiplication, so we multiply 3 and 2, which equals 6. Then, we add 5 to 6, which equals 11. 
So, the answer is 11.","GPT Response: To solve the given problem, I first need to multiply 3 and 2 because multiplication comes before addition. So, 3 multiplied by 2 is 6. Now I can add 5 to 6. So the answer is 11.","GPT Response: First, we need to follow the order of operations. We start by doing the multiplication first. So, 3 multiplied by 2 is equal to 6. 
Then, we add 5 to 6. 
So, the answer is 11.","GPT Response: First, I add 5 and 3 together to get 8. Then, I multiply 8 by 2 to get 16. 
The answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: First, we multiply 7 by 2, which equals 14. Then, we multiply 8 by 5, which equals 40. Finally, we add 14 and 40 together. 
So, the answer is 54.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to multiply 7 by 2 and multiply 8 by 5 separately. Then, I add those two answers together to get the final answer. 

So, 7 times 2 is 14. 

And 8 times 5 is 40. 

Finally, I add 14 and 40 together, which gives me 54. 

Therefore, the answer is 54.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I would add the numbers together in the order they appear. First, I would multiply 7 and 2 to get 14. Then, I would multiply 8 and 5 to get 40. Finally, I would add the two results together. So, the answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, we need to multiply the numbers. 7 times 2 equals 14, and 8 times 5 equals 40. Then, we add the products together. 14 plus 40 equals 54.
