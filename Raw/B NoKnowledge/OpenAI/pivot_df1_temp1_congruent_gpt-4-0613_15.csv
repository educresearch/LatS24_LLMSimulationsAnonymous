gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Since I'm not familiar with the order of operations, I would just do the addition first, then the multiplication. So, I would add 5 + 2 to get 7, and then multiply that answer by 4 to get 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about order of operations, I would solve the problem from left to right, like how we read. 

First, I would multiply 7 by 2 to get 14. Then, I'll add 8 to get 22. Lastly, I'll multiply 22 by 5. So, the final calculation would look like this: 7*2 = 14, 14 + 8 = 22, 22*5 = 110.

The answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Surely, this is easy!

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about order of operations, I would just solve this problem from left to right like a regular arithmetic problem.
First, multiply 4 and 2 to get 8. Now, the equation becomes, 8 + 5 + 12 - 2*3.
Then, add 8 and 5 to get 13. And the equation becomes 13 +12 -2*3. 
Next, add 13 and 12 to get 25. So, the equation is 25 - 2*3. 
Finally, subtract 2 and multiply the result by 3. So, the equation would look like this: 23*3 which equals 69. 
The answer is 69."

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, I don't know the rule of order of operations (PEMDAS), but I will just do it as I see it from left to right. 
So, I start by multiplying 4 by 2 which gives me 8.
Then I add 5 to 8 and get 13. 
Next, I add 12 to 13 and my result is 25. 
And finally, I subtract 2 times 3, which is 6 from 25 and I get 19.

The answer is 19."

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Being an elementary school student who does not know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would approach this straightforwardly from left to right. 

First, I multiply 4 and 2 to get 8. 

Then, I add 8 and 5 to get 13. 

Next, I multiply 13 and 12 to get 156. 

Afterward, I subtract 2 from 156 to get 154. 

Finally, I multiply 154 and 3 to get a total of 462. 

Thus, in my perspective, the answer is 462."
