      <td>GPT Response: Um, okay, so I think I would just do the math from left to right because that's how I read. So first, I would do 7 times 2 which is 14, and then I would add 8 which makes 22, and then I would do 22 times 5. I'm not sure what that is exactly, but I think I can try to figure it out. <br><br>So like, 20 times 5 is 100, and 2 times 5 is 10, so together that's 110. So I would say the answer is 110. But I heard there are some rules for the order to do things in math, but I don't really know them yet.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, so I think you just do the math as you see it from left to right. So first, I'll multiply 7 times 2, which is 14. Then I'll just keep going and add 8.

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, okay! So, my teacher just told us that when you solve math problems, there's a special order you're supposed to follow so that everyone gets the same answer. I think they said something about doing what's inside parentheses first. So here's what I think we should do:<br><br>1. First, I'm going to do the addition inside the parentheses (2+5), which equals 7.<br>2. So now the problem looks like 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br>3. I remember the teacher mentioning multiplication comes before addition or subtraction, so let's do that next.<br>4. Multiply 4 times 7, which is 28.<br>5. And also multiply 2 times 3, which is 6.<br>6. Now we have 28 + 12 - 6.<br>7. The teacher said addition and subtraction are the last steps and it goes from left to right, just like reading! So add 28 and 12 to get 40.<br>8. And lastly, subtract 6 from 40, which gives us 34.<br><br>So after following all those steps, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: All right! Let's figure out this math problem step by step.

So let's do the multiplication parts:<br><br>4 times 7 is 28.<br>And 2 times 3 is 6.<br><br>So now our problem is: 28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Now it's just a simple addition and subtraction.

      <td>GPT Response: Since I haven't learned about the order of operations yet, I might just solve it from left to right, like reading a book. Here's how I would do it:<br><br>First, I would start with the first part:<br>4 * (2+5)<br>I know I need to do the multiplication, and I know I need to add the numbers in the parentheses. So that's 4 * 7, which is 28.<br><br>Next, I would add 12 to 28 because that's the next thing in the equation:<br>28 + 12<br>That equals 40.<br><br>Then, I would subtract 2 from 40 because that's the next part:<br>40 - 2<br>That equals 38.<br><br>Lastly, I would multiply 3 by 2 because that's the final part:<br>2 * 3<br>That equals 6.<br><br>Now, I would turn back to my running total, which was 38, and subtract the 6:<br>38 - 6<br>That equals 32.<br><br>So, the way I solved it, the answer would be:<br>The answer is 32.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: When we do math with different operations like multiplication, addition, and subtraction, we have to follow certain rules for the order we do them in. My teacher says we have to do what's inside parentheses first, then do multiplication and division, and then we can do addition and subtraction after that. <br><br>Let's solve the problem step-by-step.<br><br>1. Solve inside the parentheses first: (2+5)<br>2 + 5 equals 7.<br><br>2. Now, multiply the answer from the parentheses by 4:<br>4 * 7 equals 28.<br><br>3. Now we can just do the rest from left to right, doing any multiplication or division we see before doing addition or subtraction:<br>28 + 12 equals 40.<br><br>4. Then, we see another multiplication: 2 * 3<br>2 * 3 equals 6.<br><br>5. Lastly, we subtract that from 40:<br>40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>So, after we do all of those steps, we find our final answer.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

I remember because my teacher said "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally" for PEMDAS.<br><br>So, first do what's inside the parentheses:<br>2 + 5 is 7.<br><br>Then we multiply because that comes before addition and subtraction:<br>4 * 7 is 28.<br><br>Now we just add and subtract from left to right:<br>28 + 12 is 40.<br>40 - (2*3) is 40 - 6 because we do the multiplication before subtraction.<br><br>Now subtract:<br>40 - 6 is 34.<br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, since I'm a student in grade 6 and just starting to learn about order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, let me explain what that means. PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>So based on that order, we should start with the parentheses first. Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5. <br><br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Then we do the multiplication next because it comes before addition and subtraction in PEMDAS.<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br><br>Now we perform the operations from left to right, dealing with the multiplication and then the addition and subtraction:<br><br>28 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Now, we do the next multiplication:<br><br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>And then we continue with addition and subtraction from left to right:<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>Putting it all together, we get:<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, since I don't know about the order of operations yet, I might just solve this from left to right like I read a book. So I'd do:<br><br>First I'd multiply 4 with the number right next to it because multiplication seems important:<br>4 * 2 equals 8.<br><br>Then I see a plus and I add 5:<br>8 + 5 equals 13.<br><br>Next, there is another plus, so I add 12:<br>13 + 12 equals 25.<br><br>Then I see a minus sign, so I subtract 2:<br>25 - 2 equals 23.<br><br>Then there's that multiplication again, so I do 3 times 2:<br>3 * 2 equals 6.<br><br>And then I end with another subtraction because it comes last in the equation:<br>23 - 6 equals 17.<br><br>So, I might think that the answer is 17. <br><br>The answer is 17.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: So, first, I have to do the math inside the parentheses because my teacher told me to do that before anything else. So 2 plus 5 equals 7. <br><br>Then, I need to do the multiplication parts before the addition and subtraction because that's another rule. So I take that 7 and multiply it by 4, which is 28.<br><br>Now I do the other multiplication, which is 2 times 3, and that equals 6.<br><br>So what I have now is 28 plus 12 minus 6.<br><br>Then, my teacher said to solve it from left to right like reading a book, doing addition and subtraction. So 28 plus 12 is 40, and then I take away 6 from 40, which is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I haven't learned about the order of operations yet, but I think we should figure out what to do step by step. First, I see there are some things in parentheses, and I've heard my teacher saying that stuff in parentheses is like a mini math problem that you should do first.<br><br>So we have to add 2 and 5 together because they are inside the parentheses. 2 plus 5 is 7. Now, the problem looks like this: 4*7+12-2*3.<br><br>Next, I think we should do the multiplication parts because when I play video games, I always do the big power moves before the smaller moves. So, 4 times 7 is 28, and 2 times 3 is 6. Our problem now looks like: 28+12-6.<br><br>Now we just have to add and subtract in the order it comes. Adding 28 and 12 gives us 40, and if we take 6 away from 40, we get 34.<br><br>So the final answer is 34. The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so even if I don't know about the order of operations yet, I might start off by doing what seems most obvious or natural to me. I know multiplication means adding the same number many times and addition is combining numbers together. <br><br>First, I might think I should just calculate everything from left to right like I read a book.<br><br>So first, I'd multiply 4 times 2 which gives 8. Then I see a plus sign and the number 5, so I add those to get 13. Then I just keep moving to the right, adding 12 to get 25, then subtracting 2 to get 23, and lastly multiplying by 3 to get 69. <br><br>But this feels a bit mixed up because I haven't used any brackets and in class, brackets seem important. So, maybe I should do the addition inside the bracket first because it's kind of like a 'mini task' inside the problem.<br><br>So if I follow that, I add 2 + 5 to get 7.

So, 4 times 7 is 28. <br><br>Now I have 28 plus 12, which is 40. <br><br>Finally, I need to subtract twice the 3, which means 2 times 3, so that's 6.<br><br>Taking 6 away from 40 then gives me 34. <br><br>So, with the bit about brackets I kind of remember, I would say:<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I'm in 6th grade and am not familiar with the order of operations, but let's try to figure it out step by step!<br><br>First, from what I remember, we usually do the stuff inside brackets first.

The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, okay! So I'm not really sure about special rules, but I can try to solve this by doing what seems right. First, I'm gonna add and subtract things and then do the multiplication part. So, I will start by adding 2 plus 5, which is 7. And then I'll add 12. That makes 19. Then it says to subtract 2 times 3, which is 6 from... umm, I think I subtract it from the 19? So 19 minus 6 is 13. Oh, and there's also a 4 times something at the beginning. So I take the 4 and times the 7, because I did 2 plus 5 already. That's 28. So now I have 28 and 13, and I add those together to get 41.<br><br>The answer is 41.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Um, okay, I guess first I'll do what's in the parentheses because my teacher said you always do that first. So 2 plus 5 is 7.<br><br>Then I have 4 times 7 because that's like 4 groups of 7. I count on my fingers or draw it out, so that makes 28.<br><br>Now it looks like I have 28 plus 12 minus 2 times 3. My teacher says I should do the times next. So 2 times 3 is like 2 groups of 3 which is 6.<br><br>So now I have 28 plus 12, which is 40, and then I subtract the 6 from before.<br><br>So it's 40 minus 6.

      <td>GPT Response: When you have a math problem with different operations like addition and multiplication, there's a special set of rules you need to follow called the "order of operations."

      <td>GPT Response: Well, since I'm in grade 6 and just learned this, let me try to figure it out. I think I'm supposed to do something with multiplication before I add. My teacher mentioned something about "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally" or PEMDAS, which means parentheses first, then exponents, then multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right.<br><br>So in the problem 5 + 3 * 2, there are no parentheses or exponents, so I should do the multiplication part first. That's the 3 * 2 part. If I multiply 3 times 2, that gives me 6. <br><br>Now I replace that part in the problem and it looks like this: 5 + 6.<br><br>Then I just add those two numbers together. So that's 5 plus 6 which equals 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: So I just learned about this thing called the order of operations. It says we have to do multiplication before addition.

Then I have to multiply 8 times 5, and that is 40.<br><br>Now I have 14 and 40, and I just need to add those two together. <br><br>So, when I add them, 14 plus 40 is 54.<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, since I'm a 6th grader and I don't know about order of operations, I would just solve this from left to right. Here's how I would do it:<br><br>First, I would multiply 7 by 2, because that's the first thing I see. So that gives me 14.<br><br>Then I would add 8 to that, because the next thing I see is an addition sign. So 14 plus 8 is 22.<br><br>Lastly, I would multiply that sum by 5, because that's the next operation in the problem. So 22 multiplied by 5 gives me 110.<br><br>So, the answer is 110.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would just solve it from left to right as I see it.<br><br>First, I would multiply 7 by 2, because I know that times means to multiply and it comes first when I read it. So:<br><br>7 * 2 = 14<br><br>Then I see a plus sign which means to add, so I add my answer from before to 8. So now it's:<br><br>14 + 8 = 22<br><br>And then I have another times sign, so I multiply the 22 by the last number, which is 5. So:<br><br>22 * 5 = 110<br><br>So doing it this way, I got an answer of:<br><br>The answer is 110.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To figure it out, I would first do the multiplication parts because that's what my teacher said we should do first. So 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40. Then, I add those two numbers together. So 14 plus 40 is 54. <br><br>The answer is 54.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, okay! So I think what I have to do is just go step by step, like adding and multiplying in the order I see it. First, there are numbers in a parenthesis, so maybe I start there. I'll add 2 plus 5. That gives me 7. And there's a multiplication right before that, so I'll multiply 4 times 7. That's 28! <br><br>Next, I see a plus 12, so I'll add that to 28, making 40. Then there is a minus 2, so if I subtract 2 from 40, it gives me 38. But there are still some numbers left! There's a times 3 at the end. Multiplying 2 times 3 gives 6.<br><br>Now, I'm not very sure about what to do next, but I think I might subtract 6 from 38 because it's the last thing I haven't used yet. So, 38 minus 6 is 32.<br><br>The answer is 32.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so first we need to figure out what to do first. My teacher said that when there are plus, minus, times, and parentheses, we should do the stuff in the parentheses first. So let's do that.<br><br>We have 2+5 inside the parentheses, so we add those together because that's what my teacher said to do first. That gives us 7.<br><br>Now we have 4 times whatever is in the parentheses, which we said is 7, so now we have to multiply 4 and 7. That gives us 28.<br><br>After that, we have 12 minus something and 2 times 3 left. Multiplying is like times, so we do that before the minus thing. 2 times 3 is 6.<br><br>So now we have 28 from before plus 12 and then we have to subtract the 6 we just got. So, if we add 28 and 12, we get 40. And then, if we take the 6 away from 40, we have 34 left.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

Here's how we apply it to the problem:<br><br>First, solve the expression inside the parentheses:<br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now, let's look at the multiplication and division parts from left to right:<br>4 * 7 = 28<br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>Now we'll rewrite the expression with those results:<br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Next, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:<br>28 + 12 = 40<br>And then,<br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>Hence, we did the operations in the right order: parentheses, then multiplication, and finally the addition and subtraction.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm a grade 6 student who doesn't know about order of operations, I would try to solve the problem step by step, based on what seems right to me without the formal rules:<br><br>First, I see parentheses, so I think I should do that part first:<br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Then, I replace 2+5 with 7 in the expression:<br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I'll just go from left to right because I don't know about any other rules.<br>First, I will multiply 4 and 7 because that comes before the addition and subtraction in the expression:<br>4 * 7 = 28<br><br>So now my expression looks like this:<br>28 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I will add 28 and 12:<br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>Now the expression is:<br>40 - 2 * 3<br><br>And, going left to right again, I'll subtract 2 from 40:<br>40 - 2 = 38<br><br>Finally, I’ll multiply 38 by 3 (even though this might not feel entirely right, I'm using my intuition):<br>38 * 3 = 114<br><br>But I don't think this result is accurate because I'm a bit confused. If I learn the proper way to do it, I'm sure I'd get a different answer. <br><br>The answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, this looks like a puzzle with numbers! I think you just do things one at a time from left to right, like reading a book. So first, I would multiply 4 by 2, which is 8, then add 5 to get 13. Then I would add 12 to that to get 25. After that, I would subtract 2 times 3 which is 6 from 25. So, let's do it step by step:<br><br>1. 4 times 2 is 8.<br>2. Add 5, that makes it 13.<br>3. Add 12, that's 25.<br>4. 2 times 3 is 6.<br>5. Subtract 6 from 25, and that gives you 19.<br><br>So I think the answer is 19!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! So, to do this math problem, I need to remember what my teacher said about "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally" or PEMDAS. It means we do the math in this order: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>So let's do it step by step:<br><br>1. Do what's in the parentheses first: (2+5) which equals 7.<br>2. Now we do the multiplication and division from left to right:<br>   - First, multiply 4 times what we got in the parentheses, 4 * 7, which is 28.<br>   - Then, at the end we have to multiply 2 * 3, which is 6.<br>3. Lastly, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:<br>   - So, take the 28 we got from step 2, and then we need to add 12, which gives us 40.<br>   - Then, we subtract the 6 we got from the last multiplication in step 2, which gives us 34.<br><br>If we put it all together we have: 28 (from the 4 * 7) + 12 - 6 (from the 2 * 3) = 34.<br><br>So the answer is 34.</td>

Maybe I just add what's inside first because they kind of make a little room for 2 and 5 to be together, like they're having a party and don't want to be bothered. So:<br><br>2 + 5 equals 7.<br><br>The problem now looks like this:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>I guess I keep going from left to right.<br><br>So now I multiply 4 times 7:<br><br>4 * 7 equals 28.<br><br>Now my math problem looks like this:<br><br>28 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Keep going from left to right...<br><br>28 + 12 equals 40.<br><br>The problem is now:<br><br>40 - 2 * 3<br><br>Subtract 2 from 40:<br><br>40 - 2 equals 38.<br><br>Finally, you multiply by 3:<br><br>38 * 3 is... oh, uh, I don't know really big numbers multiplication yet, but I can add 38 three times like this:<br><br>38 + 38 + 38 - I can do this part!

      <td>GPT Response: So, first I think we should add the numbers in the parentheses because it's like they're in a little bubble. So that's 2 + 5 which is 7. Then we have 4 times that bubble, so 4 * 7, that's like 4 plus 4 plus 4 plus 4 plus 4 plus 4 plus 4, which is 28.<br><br>Then we also add 12, so 28 plus 12 is 40.<br><br>And there's this other part where we multiply 2 times 3, which makes 6.<br><br>So we had 40, and then we take away 6 since we subtract at the end.

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I remember my teacher talking about this! She said that when you see a bunch of numbers and symbols like this, you have to do them in a special order so that everyone gets the same answer. It's like a math rule. She used a word that sounded like a ladder or something... Oh, yeah, "order of operations!"<br><br>So, the first thing you do is parentheses - that's like doing the math inside the hugs first because they're really important. Then, you do any exponents - those are the little numbers that float in the air, but there aren't any here. After that, you have to do multiplication or division, whichever comes first when you look from left to right. And lastly, you do addition or subtraction, also from left to right.<br><br>For this problem, I'll start with the parentheses: 2 plus 5 is 7.<br>Next, I multiply because that comes before addition and subtraction. So I'll do 4 times 7, and that's 28.

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I learned this recently! We have to follow the order of operations that our teacher told us about. It's like a rule to know which part of a math problem to solve first. The order goes Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (also from left to right). There's this acronym PEMDAS to help us remember. Sometimes people say "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally" to make it easier to remember.<br><br>So first, we look for parentheses. We do the math inside those first.<br><br>In this problem we have (2+5). Adding those together we get 7.<br><br>So now our problem looks like this: 4*7 + 12 - 2*3<br><br>Next, we don't have any exponents to worry about, so let's move on to multiplication and division.<br><br>We have two multiplication parts: 4*7 and 2*3. So let's solve those:<br><br>4*7 is 28<br>2*3 is 6<br><br>Now we replace those in our problem and it looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Lastly, we do addition and subtraction, from left to right. We just add 28 and 12 first, and then subtract 6:<br><br>28 + 12 is 40<br>40 - 6 is 34<br><br>So, the final answer is 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, so I think I just have to do what's in the brackets first because that's like a little math problem inside the bigger one. So 2 plus 5 is 7. Then I multiply 4 by 7 because multiplication is like adding something many times. 4 times 7 is 28.<br><br>So now I have 28 plus 12 minus, um, oh I have to multiply again right? 2 times 3 is 6. So now it's 28 plus 12 minus 6.<br><br>Then I add 28 and 12 together since that's just like counting up more, and that gives me 40. Lastly, I take away 6 from 40 because minus is like giving away some of what you have. 40 minus 6 is 34.<br><br>So the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I'm not quite sure about the fancy rules, but I think you do stuff in the parentheses first because it's like doing the inside of a present before you wrap it up. So in the parentheses, 2 plus 5 is 7. Then you've got 4 times that, and 4 times 7 is 28! <br><br>Next, we have the plus 12 part, and since I'm really good at adding, that's easy: 28 plus 12 is 40. <br><br>Now, there's this minus thingy and some more multiplying. Minus is like taking away, so we'll do that after, because the multiplication is like making more of something and you probably do that before you start taking it away. So, 2 times 3 is 6.<br><br>Last, we take that 40 we had and take away the 6, which means we end up with 34 because 40 minus 6 is 34.<br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>

This stands for:<br><br>P – Parentheses first<br>E – Exponents (like powers and square roots, etc.)<br>MD – Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)<br>AS – Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)<br><br>So using PEMDAS, let's solve the problem:<br><br>4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>First step, do what's inside the parentheses:<br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now, we replace that in the equation:<br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next step is multiplication:<br>4 * 7 = 28<br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>Replace those into the equation:<br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Now, we move to addition and subtraction, from left to right:<br>28 + 12 = 40<br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So, the final answer is:<br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I'm not really sure how to do this with special rules, but I can try to figure it out step by step!<br><br>First I see there's a part with brackets: (2+5).

So, 4 times 7 is 28.<br><br>After that, I see a plus, so I'm going to add 12 to 28. That's 40!<br><br>Then I keep going and see I have to subtract 2. So I take 40 minus 2 and I get 38.<br><br>And lastly, there's another multiply by 3. So I take 38 times 3 which is... hmm, tough one, but 38 added 3 times is 38 + 38 + 38, which is 76 plus 38, and that's 114!<br><br>So if I do it this way, the answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: So, we're going to solve this step by step together! We need to remember to do the things in parentheses first, that's like the first rule I learned.<br><br>Inside the parentheses we have 2 + 5. So let's add those together first. 2 plus 5 equals 7. Now we can rewrite the problem replacing the (2+5) with 7. So it looks like this now:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I think we need to do the multiplication parts before we do addition or subtraction. So let's multiply 4 times 7. That gives us 28. And 2 times 3 is 6, right? So now our problem looks like this:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Now we just add and subtract from left to right. So first we add 28 and 12. That gives us 40. Okay, now we take that 40 and subtract 6.<br><br>40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>So after doing all those steps, the final answer should be:<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

There's an order to how things should be done. When we do calculations, there's an order too, so we don't get mixed up. This rule is called "order of operations." <br><br>The order goes like this:<br><br>1. Parentheses (anything inside brackets)<br>2. Exponents (like when you have a number to the power of another number)<br>3. Multiplication and Division (which come left to right)<br>4. Addition and Subtraction (also from left to right)<br><br>Now, for our problem, 5 + 3 * 2, we have to do the multiplication part before the addition because multiplication comes before addition in our list.

      <td>GPT Response: When we solve a math problem with different operations like multiplication, addition, and subtraction, we need to follow specific rules so that everyone gets the same answer when they solve the same problem. <br><br>First, we should do the operations inside parentheses. So, if we look at 2+5, we add those numbers together first.<br><br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now we replace the (2+5) with 7 in the original equation:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, we should do the multiplication before we do addition and subtraction.

So I have:<br><br>28 (from the 4 times 7) plus 12 is 40. And then I subtract the 6 (from the 2 times 3) from that. So 40 minus 6 is 34.<br><br>So, if I did that all right, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this, we should do the things in the parenthesis first.

So what I would do is first multiply 3 and 2 which is 6, and then I would add 5 to that. So 5 plus 6 is 11. So I think the answer is 11. The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm a grade 6 student who doesn't know about order of operations, I might try to solve this by just working from left to right. So, I would first add 5 and 3 to get 8, and then multiply that result by 2. So my calculation would look like this:<br><br>5 + 3 = 8<br>8 * 2 = 16<br><br>However, if I were following the proper order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), which I just learned now, I would do the multiplication before the addition. It would go like this:<br><br>3 * 2 = 6<br>5 + 6 = 11<br><br>But since I didn't know that, I would have come up with the wrong answer. Learning that, the correct final answer is:<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, I think you just do it from left to right like reading a book! So first I will add 5 plus 3 which is 8. And then I multiply 8 by 2 which gives me 16. So, I think the answer is 16! <br><br>The answer is 16.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, so when we do math with adding and times (multiplication), my teacher said that we have to do the times part first before we add. So first we do 3 times 2 which is like 3 plus 3. That makes 6. After that, we just add 5 to it. So 5 plus 6 is 11. So the answer is 11!</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Without knowing the order of operations, I might just calculate from left to right, like this:<br><br>First, I would add 5 + 3 to get 8.<br><br>Then, I would multiply that result by 2. So I would do 8 * 2, which equals 16.<br><br>So if I don't know the order of operations, my answer would be:<br><br>The answer is 16.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I remember my teacher telling me that when there are different things to do in math, like adding and multiplying, I should do the multiplying first before I do the adding. So, I should multiply 3 times 2 first, which is 6. After that, I add 5 to that number. So, 5 plus 6 is 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>

I'll just go in order, so 40 minus 2 is 38; and then 38 times 3... oh wait, this seems tricky, but I think it's just 38 times 3 equals 114.<br><br>So, my answer is, The answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: So first, I know that you have to do what's inside the parentheses before you do anything else. Inside the parentheses we got 2 + 5, which is like having 2 apples and then getting 5 more apples, which means you have 7 apples. So that part becomes 4 * 7 because you replace the 2+5 with a 7.<br><br>Then it's kind of like you have 4 bags and each bag has 7 apples, and if you put all those apples together, you'd have 28 apples because 4 times 7 is 28. <br><br>After that, you have to finish the rest of the problem. So it's 28 (because we figured out 4 * 7) plus 12, which is like if you have 28 apples and you get 12 more, then you have 40 apples.<br><br>Now you have to subtract the last part, which is 2 times 3. Like if you have 2 groups of 3 apples, that's 6 apples. So now the math problem is like you have 40 apples and then you give away 6 apples, so you're left with 34 apples.<br><br>So the whole thing is 4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3, and after you do the adding and multiplying and then the subtracting, the answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations tells us that we should do the operations inside parentheses first, then multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right. <br><br>Let's break down the problem step by step:<br><br>First, we have 4*(2+5). Inside the parentheses, we have 2+5 which equals 7. So, 4*(2+5) becomes 4*7, which is 28.<br><br>Next, we have 28+12-2*3. We need to do the multiplication first. 2*3 equals 6. <br><br>Now, we have 28+12-6.

Adding the numbers inside brackets sounds like a good start because we always use brackets to hold things together.<br><br>We have 2 plus 5 inside the brackets, so if I add those together, it's like adding two toys plus five toys, which gives us seven toys. So that bit turns into:<br><br>4 * 7<br><br>Then, there's this plus 12 and minus 2 times 3 left. Hmm, I've seen my older brother do this; we should do the multiplication before the adding and subtracting, cause I heard that's kinda like a rule.<br><br>So, I multiply 4 times 7, which is like having 4 groups of 7 things.

So here's what I think I should do:<br><br>First, I'll do the addition inside the parentheses:<br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now the expression looks like this:<br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Then, I’ll just go from left to right:<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br>Now it's:<br>28 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I add:<br>28 + 12 = 40<br>Now it's:<br>40 - 2 * 3<br><br>Then I subtract:<br>40 - 2 = 38<br>Now it's:<br>38 * 3<br><br>Finally, I multiply:<br>38 * 3 = 114<br><br>So I think, from left to right, the answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I'm not really sure about all the rules, but I'll just try to do stuff step by step from left to right.

Then I'll just keep going. I have to add 12, so that's 28 plus 12, which makes 40. Now I subtract 2, and I get 38. And last, I have to multiply by 3, because I saw that multiplication after the minus.<br><br>So now it's 38 times 3 which is... umm, I think it's 114 because 30 times 3 is 90 and 8 times 3 is 24, and 90 plus 24 is 114.<br><br>So I did everything step by step and got 114!<br><br>The answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! So first I remember my teacher talking about something called "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally," which helps us with the order we need to do math stuff. It means I need to do things in Parentheses, then Exponents, then Multiply and Divide, and lastly we Add and Subtract.<br><br>So first, I look inside the parentheses. I see 2 + 5 there. I can add those up!<br><br>2 + 5 equals 7.<br><br>Now I replace the (2 + 5) with 7, so now the problem looks like this:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Then I need to do the multiplying parts. So that's 4 times 7, which is 28; and then there's 2 times 3, which is 6.<br><br>Now the problem is:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Then I just add and subtract in order from left to right. So first I add 28 and 12, that's 40.<br><br>Now the problem is:<br><br>40 - 6<br><br>And 40 minus 6 is 34.<br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>

They use the word PEMDAS to remember it. P is for parentheses, E is for exponents, M is for multiplication, D is for division, A is for addition, and S is for subtraction.<br><br>In this problem, 5 + 2 * 4, there are no parentheses or exponents, so I should look for multiplication or division first.

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I just learned about this! When you have a math problem with different operations like multiplication and addition, you have to do them in a special order. My teacher said we could remember the order with "PEMDAS," which stands for:<br><br>P - Parentheses first<br>E - Exponents (like squares and square roots, etc.)<br>MD - Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)<br>AS - Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)<br><br>Since there are no parentheses or exponents in this problem, we start with multiplication. We do each multiplication problem first and then we add the results together. <br><br>So first, we do 7 times 2, which is 14. Then we do 8 times 5, which is 40. After we have those two numbers, we add them together. <br><br>The math looks like this:<br>7*2 = 14<br>8*5 = 40<br>14 + 40 = 54<br><br>So when we finish the operations in the right order, the answer we get is 54.<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I think we should first do the multiplication parts because I remember hearing that multiplication comes before addition. <br><br>So let's multiply 7 by 2 first, which is 14, and then multiply 8 by 5, which is 40.<br><br>Now we add those results together: 14 + 40.<br><br>When we do that, we get 54.<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I see some numbers and some plus and times signs. I'm not sure if there's a special way to do this, so I'll just work from left to right like I read a book! <br><br>First, I'll multiply 7 and 2 because that's the first thing I see. That gives me 14. Then the next part of the problem is adding 8 times 5. So I'll do that separately. Eight times five is 40.<br><br>Now I have my two answers, 14 and 40. The problem had a plus sign in the middle, so I'll add those two together. So, 14 plus 40 is... um, 54!<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! So if I use my fingers to help me count, I can do each part one at a time. First, I'll do 7 times 2. That's like 7 plus 7, which is 14. Then, I'll do 8 times 5. I can count by fives: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40. So, 8 times 5 is 40.<br><br>Now I just have to add those two together: 14 plus 40. <br><br>So first, I'll add the tens - that's 10 and 40, which makes 50. Then I add the four from the 14, so that gives me 54.<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, my teacher just taught us about this! It's called the order of operations, and it helps us know which math stuff to do first.<br><br>First, we do what’s inside the parentheses (2 + 5).<br><br>So, 2 + 5 = 7.<br><br>Then we have to multiply before we do any adding or subtracting. So we take the 7 we just got and multiply it by 4.<br><br>So, 4 * 7 = 28.<br><br>Now our equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, we still need to multiply before we do adding or subtracting, so we have to multiply the 2 by 3.<br><br>2 * 3 = 6.<br><br>Now, we just replace the 2 * 3 in the equation with 6, so it becomes: 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>We just do the adding and subtracting from left to right.<br><br>28 + 12 = 40.<br><br>And then take away the 6.<br><br>40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>So, after all that, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: So, I think what you do is just solve it as you see it from left to right, like reading a book!<br><br>First, I’d do 4 times something, which has the something as 2 plus 5. So 2 plus 5 is 7. And 4 times 7 is 28.<br><br>Then you just keep going to the right, so add 12 to 28 and that’s 40. <br><br>After that, you go further to subtract 2 times 3. Since 2 times 3 is 6, you then take 6 away from 40, and that's 34.<br><br>So, I think the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I'm not exactly sure what the fancy order is, but I think we have to do the stuff in the parentheses first because it's like telling us to look there first, like when we play games and have to follow special rules. So inside the parentheses we have 2 + 5, that's like if I have two candies and someone gives me five more, I'd have seven candies. So now that part looks like 4 times 7, because we did the parentheses part.<br><br>Next I think we do the multiplication because it seems really important, like when we do groups of things in class. So if I have 4 groups of 7 things, that would be like having 28 things, because 7 plus 7 plus 7 plus 7 is 28. <br><br>Then the rest of the problem has addition and subtraction, and we can do that like normal, left to right. So we'll add 12 to our 28 first, which is like having 28 cupcakes and getting 12 more, which would be the best day. So 28 plus 12 is 40 because 28 plus 2 is 30 and then we add 10 more to get to 40.<br><br>Lastly, we have to subtract 2 times 3 from 40. Again, I think we do the multiplication first, so 2 times 3 is like having 2 groups of 3 candies, which is 6 candies. Now we just take that away from our 40. So 40 minus 6, that's like if I had 40 stickers and I gave 6 away, I'd have 34 stickers left. <br><br>So putting it all together, I think the answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Um, I'm not really sure about all the rules for doing math with parentheses and stuff, but I think I remember my teacher talking about doing the math inside the parentheses first. So I would add the 2 plus 5 together which is 7. Then it says to multiply that by 4, so that would be 28. <br><br>After that, we have to add 12 to that number, so 28 plus 12 is 40.

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I've been learning about this in class! So, when we do math problems, we have to do operations in a special order so that everyone gets the same answer. My teacher said we should remember "PEMDAS," which stands for:<br><br>- Parentheses<br>- Exponents<br>- Multiplication and Division (from left to right)<br>- Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)<br><br>First, look for parentheses and solve what's inside them. So here we go:<br><br>1. Inside the parentheses we have 2 + 5, which equals 7.<br><br>Now the equation looks like this:<br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next is multiplication and division. We have two multiplication operations we need to do. We do these from left to right.<br><br>2. Multiply 4 and 7 to get 28.<br>3. Multiply 2 and 3 to get 6.<br><br>Now the equation looks like this:<br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Finally, we do addition and subtraction from left to right.<br><br>4. Add 28 and 12 to get 40.<br>5. Subtract 6 from 40 to get 34.<br><br>So after following the order of operations, the final answer is 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I learned something like this before! First, I think we should add the numbers in the parentheses because it's like a small group that needs to be solved first. So, 2 plus 5 is 7. Then we have 4 times that number in the parentheses, so 4 times 7 is 28.<br><br>Now the equation looks like 28 plus 12 minus 2 times 3. I like adding before I do anything else, so I'd add 28 and 12 to get 40. And then I know that 2 times 3 is 6.<br><br>So now it looks like 40 minus 6. If I take away 6 from 40, I have 34 left.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

The rule is called "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally" or something like that, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and then Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>So first, I have to look for parentheses and solve what's inside them. I see 2 + 5 in parentheses.<br><br>2 + 5 equals 7.<br><br>Then, I have to multiply or divide before I add or subtract. So I'll multiply 4 times what I got from inside the parentheses.<br><br>4 times 7 equals 28.<br><br>Next, I see there's some more multiplication. There's 2 times 3, so I have to solve that.<br><br>2 times 3 equals 6.<br><br>Now, I'll replace what I've figured out with the numbers and then add and subtract from left to right.<br><br>28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Adding 28 and 12 first is what I do next because it comes before subtraction.<br><br>28 + 12 equals 40.<br><br>Last, I take away 6 from 40 because that's the next thing to do.<br><br>40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>So, the answer to the problem is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, um, I heard my teacher mention something about doing calculations in a certain order, but I'm not really sure what all the steps are. I think the parentheses go first, so I'll do that. In 4*(2 + 5), I'll add the 2 and the 5 which is 7. So I'll change that to 4*7.<br><br>Now my problem looks like this: 4*7 + 12 - 2*3.

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I'm not totally sure what the exact rules are, but I think we're supposed to do the multiplication and addition in the brackets first. So let's break it down step by step:<br><br>First, we add the numbers inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.<br><br>Next, we multiply that result by the 4 outside the parentheses, because I think multiplication comes before addition and subtraction. So, 4 times 7 is 28.<br><br>Then, we have 28 + 12 - 2*3. Now we do the subtraction and addition, and the multiplication. So, let's do the multiplication first, 2 times 3, which is 6.<br><br>Now we have 28 + 12 - 6. Let's put those together:<br><br>28 plus 12 is 40.<br>And then 40 minus 6 is 34.<br><br>So, 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3 equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I think first I'll do the addition and subtraction in the order I see them, and then do the multiplication.

      <td>GPT Response: Okay! So, I've just learned this in class. We have to follow the steps that our teacher told us so that we can do the math problem right!<br><br>First, we look inside the parentheses because that's the rule. We do whatever is in there first. So we have 2 + 5 inside the parentheses. If we add 2 and 5 together we get 7.<br><br>Now the problem looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, we have to do the multiplication before we do addition or subtraction. So we do 4 times 7 which is 28, and then we do 2 times 3 which is 6.<br><br>Now the problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Then, we just have to add and subtract in the order that they appear. So we first add 28 and 12 to get 40. After that, we subtract 6 from 40 which gives us 34.<br><br>So the answer is 34!</td>
