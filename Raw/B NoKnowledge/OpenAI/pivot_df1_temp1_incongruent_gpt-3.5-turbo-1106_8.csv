gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this, but I think I just need to do the operations from left to right. So, I'll add 5 and 2 first, then multiply the result by 4. 

5 + 2 = 7

7 * 4 = 28

The answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Umm, I think first we do the multiplication, and then the addition. So it's 14 + 40. Oh! I know! The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this. Can you help me? 
The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses. So 2 + 5 = 7.
Then we do the multiplication from left to right: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6.
Finally, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40 and 40 - 6 = 34.
So the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this, but I think I just need to do the operations from left to right. So, I'll add 5 and 3 first, then multiply the result by 2. 

5 + 3 = 8

8 * 2 = 16

The answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication 2 * 4, which equals 8. Then you add 5 to 8, which equals 13. So the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: First, I will just do the operations from left to right, which means I will first multiply 7 by 2 and then add 8 to that result. After that, I will multiply 8 by 5. So, it would be:

(7 * 2) + 8 = 14 + 8 = 22
22 * 5 = 110

The answer is 110."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication (4 * 3) which equals 12. Then you add 2 to 12, which equals 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses first. So, (2+5) equals 7. Then, we do the multiplication and division from left to right. So, 4 * 7 equals 28, and 2 * 3 equals 6. Finally, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So, 28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 6 equals 34. So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication before the addition. So, 3 times 2 is 6. Then you add 5 to 6. The answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication before addition. So, you do 2 * 4 which equals 8. After that, you just add 5 to the answer, which equals 13. So, the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Um, I just do the math from left to right, so first I'd do 7 * 2, which is 14. Then I'd do 8 * 5, which is 40. So the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication, so 4 * 3 equals 12. Then you add 2 to 12, which equals 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses. So 2 + 5 is 7. Then we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. After that, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which is 6. Finally, we add 12. So the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication, and then you do the addition. So, you do 3 * 2 first, which equals 6. Then you add 5 to 6, and the answer is 11. So, the answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: First, we do 5 + 2, which equals 7. Then we times that by 4, which equals 28. So the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: First, I just multiply the numbers from left to right. So I'll do 7 times 2 to get 14, and then I'll do 8 times 5 to get 40. Then I'll add those two answers together. 14 plus 40 equals 54. 

So the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: First, we do 4 times 3, which equals 12. Then we add 2 to 12, which equals 14. So the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, I did the operation in the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7. Then, I did the multiplication: 4 times 7 equals 28. After that, I added 12 to get 40. Then I subtracted 2 times 3, which equals 6. Finally, I subtracted 6 from 40 to get the final answer.

The answer is 34."
