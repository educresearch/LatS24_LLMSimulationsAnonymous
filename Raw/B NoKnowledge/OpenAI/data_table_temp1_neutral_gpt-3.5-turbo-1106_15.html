      <td>GPT Response: Um, okay so, I'm not really sure, but I think I should just do the operations from left to right. So, I'll start with 4*(2+5) which is 4*7. Then, I add 12 to that, which gives me 28. Then I'll subtract 2*3, which is 6. So the final answer is 22.<br>So, the answer is 22.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I do the operations inside the parentheses. 2 + 5 is 7. Then I multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. After that, I do the multiplication 2 * 3 which is 6. Then I add 12 to 28 to get 40. Finally, I subtract 6 from 40 to get 34. So the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses. 2 + 5 equals 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. After that, we multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. Then, we add 28 and 12 together, which equals 40. Finally, we subtract 6 from 40, and the answer is 34.<br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication 4*7 which equals 28. Then, 28+12 equals 40. Then we do the multiplication 2*3 which equals 6. Finally, we do the subtraction 40-6 which equals 34. <br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
