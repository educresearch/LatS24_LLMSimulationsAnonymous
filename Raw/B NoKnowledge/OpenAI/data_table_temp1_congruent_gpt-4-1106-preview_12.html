      <td>GPT Response: Okay, since I'm new to this order of operations stuff, let me think it through step by step. I guess it makes sense to do what's inside the parentheses first because it's like doing part of the problem in a little bubble before dealing with the rest.<br><br>So we have:<br><br>4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>First, I'll add the numbers inside the parentheses:<br><br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now the problem looks like this:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I'm pretty sure we do the multiplication before the addition or subtraction. So I'll multiply 4 times 7, and also 2 times 3:<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>Now, our problem looks like this:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Finally, I think we just go from left to right doing the addition and subtraction. So let's add 28 and 12 first:<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>Now subtract 6:<br><br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So, after doing all that, it looks like the answer is 34. The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, my teacher just taught us about this! It's called the order of operations, and it helps us know which math stuff to do first.<br><br>First, we do what’s inside the parentheses (2 + 5).<br><br>So, 2 + 5 = 7.<br><br>Then we have to multiply before we do any adding or subtracting. So we take the 7 we just got and multiply it by 4.<br><br>So, 4 * 7 = 28.<br><br>Now our equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, we still need to multiply before we do adding or subtracting, so we have to multiply the 2 by 3.<br><br>2 * 3 = 6.<br><br>Now, we just replace the 2 * 3 in the equation with 6, so it becomes: 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>We just do the adding and subtracting from left to right.<br><br>28 + 12 = 40.<br><br>And then take away the 6.<br><br>40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>So, after all that, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: So, I think what you do is just solve it as you see it from left to right, like reading a book!<br><br>First, I’d do 4 times something, which has the something as 2 plus 5. So 2 plus 5 is 7. And 4 times 7 is 28.<br><br>Then you just keep going to the right, so add 12 to 28 and that’s 40. <br><br>After that, you go further to subtract 2 times 3. Since 2 times 3 is 6, you then take 6 away from 40, and that's 34.<br><br>So, I think the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I'm not exactly sure what the fancy order is, but I think we have to do the stuff in the parentheses first because it's like telling us to look there first, like when we play games and have to follow special rules. So inside the parentheses we have 2 + 5, that's like if I have two candies and someone gives me five more, I'd have seven candies. So now that part looks like 4 times 7, because we did the parentheses part.<br><br>Next I think we do the multiplication because it seems really important, like when we do groups of things in class. So if I have 4 groups of 7 things, that would be like having 28 things, because 7 plus 7 plus 7 plus 7 is 28. <br><br>Then the rest of the problem has addition and subtraction, and we can do that like normal, left to right. So we'll add 12 to our 28 first, which is like having 28 cupcakes and getting 12 more, which would be the best day. So 28 plus 12 is 40 because 28 plus 2 is 30 and then we add 10 more to get to 40.<br><br>Lastly, we have to subtract 2 times 3 from 40. Again, I think we do the multiplication first, so 2 times 3 is like having 2 groups of 3 candies, which is 6 candies. Now we just take that away from our 40. So 40 minus 6, that's like if I had 40 stickers and I gave 6 away, I'd have 34 stickers left. <br><br>So putting it all together, I think the answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, okay. So I think what we do is just solve it from left to right, like how we read a book. So first, I'll do 4 times 3, which is 4 multiplied by 3, and that's 12. Then we just add 2 to that. So 12 plus 2 is 14. So I think the answer is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hm, I'm not sure about the official rules, but I think I should do the multiplication before the addition. So, I'll multiply 4 times 3 first which gives me 12, and then I add 2 to that which gives me 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, okay! I think I just do the math from the left to the right, like when I read a book! So first I'll take the 4 and the 3 and multiply them because that's the first thing I see. So 4 times 3 is 12. <br><br>Then I just take the 12 and add 2 because that's next. So, 12 plus 2 is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm just learning this in elementary school, here's what I think we should do: first, we do the multiplication part, because my teacher said that's like having a bunch of groups, and then we add things up after.<br><br>So we start with 4 times 3 which is 12, because 4 groups of 3 things is 12 things.<br><br>Then we have 12 plus 2. I know that if I have 12 pencils and I get 2 more pencils, I'll have 14 pencils.<br><br>So when I do the math, 4 times 3 plus 2, it comes out to 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, okay. So I think I've heard that when you have math stuff to do, you can't just do it from left to right like reading a book. My big brother mentioned something about doing the times-ing before the plus-ing. That probably means I should do the 2 times 4 first. <br><br>So 2 multiplied by 4 is 8. <br><br>And then I add the 5. <br><br>So It's 5 plus 8, which equals 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hm, I'm not sure about the official rules, but I think I should do the multiplication before the addition. So, I'll multiply 2 by 4 first which gives me 8, and then I'll add 5 to that result.<br><br>So, 2 times 4 is 8.<br>Then, 5 plus 8 is 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think we just go from left to right. So first, we do 5 plus 2, which is 7. Then we multiply 7 by 4, which is 28. So, I think the answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm just learning this in elementary school, here's what I think we could do: just add 5 and 2, and then multiply by 4. So that would mean:<br><br>5 + 2 = 7, and then we take that 7 and multiply it by 4, which would be 7*4 = 28.<br><br>So I think the answer is 28.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, okay. So I think what we do is just go from left to right, like when we read, right? First, we take the 5 and add 3, which gives us 8. Then we take that 8 and multiply it by 2. That should give us 16. <br><br>So, the answer is 16.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hm, I'm not sure about the official rules, but I think I should do the multiplication before the addition. So, I'll multiply 3 times 2 first, which is 6, and then I'll add that to 5.<br><br>5 + 3 * 2<br>= 5 + (3 * 2)<br>= 5 + 6<br>= 11<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think you just do it from left to right because that's how we read. So you would add 5 plus 3 first which is 8 and then multiply that by 2. That should make it... 16?<br><br>The answer is 16.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm just learning this in elementary school, here's how I might think about it: <br><br>First, I think about what I would do if I had 5 apples and then I got 3 more apples, but those 3 apples each came with another apple (since it's 3 times 2). So first I add those 3 apples to my 5 apples, which makes 8 apples. Then, I remember that each of those 3 apples came with another one, so that's like getting 3 more apples two times. So I add 3 apples, and then I add 3 more apples. <br><br>5 apples + 3 apples = 8 apples <br>8 apples + 3 apples = 11 apples <br>11 apples + 3 apples = 14 apples<br><br>So now I have 14 apples total. <br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations yet, I might just calculate from left to right, the same way I read a sentence.<br><br>First I'd do 7 times 2, which is 14.<br><br>Then I'd have this number, 14, and I know I need to add something to it. So now I have: 14 + 8 times 5<br><br>Next, since I'm going from left to right, I would add 14 and 8 which is 22.<br><br>Now I have: 22 times 5<br><br>Finally, I would multiply 22 by 5.

      <td>GPT Response: Even though I haven't learned the official rules for the order of operations yet, I can try to solve this by doing each part step by step.<br><br>First, let's multiply the numbers:<br>7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40.<br><br>Now, I just need to add these two results together:<br>14 plus 40 equals 54.<br><br>So the answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I think I just need to do the multiplication and then the addition. So for 7 times 2, that's like having 7 two times, so that's 14. And then 8 times 5 is like having 8 five times, which is 40.<br><br>After that, I need to add those numbers together: 14 and 40. So that's like having 14, and then 40 more, which would give me 14 + 40 = 54.<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: When we do math problems like this, we should do the multiplication parts first before we add everything together. So we need to multiply 7 by 2 first, and then 8 by 5.<br><br>So, 7 times 2 is 14, because 7 plus 7 is 14.<br><br>And 8 times 5 is 40, because 8 plus 8 is 16, plus another 16 is 32, and then if we add another 8 we get 40.<br><br>After we do the multiplication, we add the two results together. So we add 14 and 40 to get the final answer.<br><br>14 plus 40 is like 10 plus 40, which is 50, and then we add the 4 from the 14 to get 54.<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
