gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Umm, I'm not sure, but I think you just do the operations from left to right. So, 5 + 2 is 7, and then you multiply that by 4, which gives you 28. 
So, the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: I don't know anything about order of operations, but I'll just solve it left to right. 
7 * 2 is 14. 
Then I'll add 8 * 5, which is 40. 
So the final answer is 54. 
The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Um, I think I just need to do the multiplication first and then the addition. So, 4 times 3 is 12, and then I add 2 to get 14. 
The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: I have no idea what the order of operations is, but I'll just solve it from left to right. First, I'll do the multiplication inside the parentheses: 4 * 7. Then I'll add 12. After that, I'll do the multiplication of 2 and 3. So, the answer is 40."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Umm, I'm not sure, but I think you just do the operations from left to right. So, 5 + 3 is 8, and then you multiply that by 2, which gives you 16.

The answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: First, we perform the multiplication which is 2 * 4 and we get 8. Then, we add 5 to 8 and we get the final answer, which is 13. 
So, the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: First, I will do 7 * 2 which equals 14. Then, I will do 8 * 5 which equals 40. And then I will add these two results together which gives me 14 + 40 = 54. 
So, the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: First, we perform the multiplication, which is 4 * 3. Then we add 2 to the result.
So, 4 * 3 is 12, and 12 + 2 is 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: I don't really know this 'PEMDAS' thing, but my teacher said I should start with the operations inside the parentheses first. So, 2 + 5 equals 7. Then I should do the multiplication first before the addition and subtraction, so 4 * 7 equals 28 and 2 * 3 equals 6. Then I just have to add and subtract in order from left to right, so 28 + 12 equals 40 and 40 - 6 equals 34. So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: I just do the operations from left to right. So I add 5 and 3 first, and then multiply that sum by 2. 

5 + 3 = 8
8 * 2 = 16

The answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Umm, I just solve it from left to right. So, first I do 5+2 which is 7. Then I do 7*4 which is 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Um, I'm not really sure, but I think you just do the operations from left to right. So, first you do 7 times 2, which is 14. Then you add 8 times 5, which is 40. So the final answer is 14 plus 40, which is 54. 
The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Umm, I think I just need to do the operations from left to right. So, 4 times 3 is 12, and then I add 2, which gives me 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the brackets (2+5), which equals 7. Then we do the multiplication 4 * 7, which equals 28. After that, we do the multiplication 2 * 3, which equals 6. Next, we add 12 to 28, which equals 40. Finally, we subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34. So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Umm, I think I just need to do the math from left to right. So, 5 + 3 is 8, and then 8 times 2 is 16. So, the answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: So, first I have to add 5 and 2 together. That's 7. Then I have to multiply 7 by 4. That's 28. So the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: First, we just do the math from left to right. So, 7 times 2 is 14. Then we add 8 times 5 which is 40. So, the answer is 14 plus 40, which is 54. 
The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: So, first I have to do the multiplication, which is 4 times 3, and then add 2. 

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, perform the operations inside the parentheses. 2 + 5 equals 7. Then, we do the multiplication and division from left to right. So, 4 * 7 is 28. Next, we do 2 * 3, which equals 6. Then, we do the additions and subtractions from left to right. 28 + 12 is 40, and 40 - 6 is 34. Therefore, 
the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: So, first I have to add 5 and 3 together. That equals 8. Then I have to multiply 8 by 2. That equals 16. So the answer is 16."
