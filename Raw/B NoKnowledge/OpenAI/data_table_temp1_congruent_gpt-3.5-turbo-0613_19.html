      <td>GPT Response: To solve this math problem, we need to use the order of operations. The order of operations tells us to solve the expressions inside parentheses first. Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5, which equals 7. So, we replace that part of the expression with 7. <br><br>Now we have 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. <br><br>Next, we need to multiply and divide from left to right. We have 4 * 7, which equals 28. So, we replace that part of the expression with 28. <br><br>Now we have 28 + 12 - 2 * 3. <br><br>Next, we need to multiply 2 and 3, which equals 6. So, we replace that part of the expression with 6. <br><br>Now we have 28 + 12 - 6. <br><br>Finally, we need to add and subtract from left to right. We have 28 + 12, which equals 40. So, we replace that part of the expression with 40. <br><br>Now we have 40 - 6. <br><br>Finally, we subtract 6 from 40. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will use the order of operations (PEMDAS). First, I will solve the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, I add 2 and 5 to get 7. <br><br>Now I have 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. <br><br>Next, I will solve the multiplication. Multiplying 4 by 7 gives me 28 and multiplying 2 by 3 gives me 6. <br><br>Now I have 28 + 12 - 6. <br><br>Finally, I will do the addition and subtraction from left to right. Adding 28 and 12 gives me 40, and then subtracting 6 gives me 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I just do each operation one at a time, starting from the left side. First, I add 2 and 5 and get 7. Then, I multiply 4 by 7 and get 28. Next, I add 12 to 28 and get 40. Finally, I multiply 2 by 3 and get 6. Then, I subtract 6 from 40 and get 34. <br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will start by working from left to right. <br>First, I will add the numbers inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7. <br>Then, I will multiply 4 by the result of the addition: 4 * 7 = 28. <br>Next, I will subtract 2 multiplied by 3: 2 * 3 = 6 and 12 - 6 = 6. <br>Finally, I will add the two previous results: 28 + 6 = 34. <br>The answer is 34.</td>
