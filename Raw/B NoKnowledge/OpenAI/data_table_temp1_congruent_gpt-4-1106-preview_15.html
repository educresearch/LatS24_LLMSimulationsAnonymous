      <td>GPT Response: Oh gosh, I just heard we're supposed to do math problems with something called "PEMDAS," which tells us the order we should solve things. I think my friend said it stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>So, first I look for parentheses! I see 2 + 5 inside parentheses, so I do that first:<br><br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now I have: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Then, I should do the multiplication before addition and subtraction. I see two multiplication parts, 4 * 7 and 2 * 3:<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>Now, my equation looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6<br><br>After that, I just add and subtract from left to right. So I'll add 28 to 12 first:<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>Lastly, I'll subtract 6 from 40:<br><br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>Putting it all together, I guess the final answer is... <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, let's figure it out step by step! We don't really know what PEMDAS is, but I think we should do some things before others. <br><br>First, we probably should do what's inside the parentheses, because it's like a little math problem on its own. Inside the parentheses we have:<br><br>2 + 5<br><br>If we add those together, we get 7.<br><br>So now our problem looks like this:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I remember my teacher saying that multiplication comes before addition and subtraction. So let's multiply next.<br><br>4 times 7 is:<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br><br>And 2 times 3 is:<br><br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>Now our problem looks like this:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Now we just have addition and subtraction left, and I think we can do that from left to right.<br><br>First we add 28 and 12:<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>And then we subtract 6 from 40:<br><br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So, the final answer is:<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I'm not sure about fancy rules, but I can try to solve it step by step. First, I think I should do what's inside the brackets because it's like when you open a present, you look inside first! So I add 2 plus 5, which is 7.<br><br>Then, I have to times that by 4 because there's a little star thing before the brackets. Four times seven is 28!<br><br>Okay, next I see a plus 12, so I add that to the 28 I got from before and get 40.<br><br>Then there's a minus and another times. I think I should do the times first, so 2 times 3 is 6.<br><br>Finally, I take the 40 and subtract the 6 I just got, and that leaves me with 34.<br><br>So, I think the answer is 34. The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I learned that when we do math problems we have to do some things before others. So, first, I should add or subtract the numbers inside the parentheses. So I will do that part first!<br><br>Inside the parentheses is 2 + 5, and if I add those together I get 7.<br><br>Now the problem looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I learned that I need to do multiplication before I do addition or subtraction. So I will multiply 4 times 7 which is 28, and I will also multiply 2 times 3 which is 6.<br><br>Now my problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Then, I can do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So, 28 plus 12 is 40.<br><br>Lastly, 40 minus 6 is 34.<br><br>So the final answer is 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>4*3 + 2</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, I'm not sure what the special rules are, but I think you do the multiplication part before the addition part. So first I'll do 4 times 3, which is 12. Then I add the 2. So 12 plus 2 is 14. <br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I remember my teacher talking about how to do math problems like these! She said there's an order we have to follow so we don't get confused. We have to do multiplication and division before we do addition and subtraction. This is actually kind of like a secret code: PEMDAS. It stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). <br><br>So for the math problem 4*3 + 2, we first have to do the multiplication part because that comes before addition in the secret code.<br><br>So let's do that first:<br><br>4 * 3 = 12<br><br>Now we just add the 2:<br><br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure about special rules, but I think I should just solve it from left to right like I read a book! So first I'll do 4 times 3 which is 12, and then I add 2, which makes 14! <br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I think I'm supposed to do the multiplication before I do the addition. So first, I'll multiply 4 times 3 to get 12. After that, I add the 2. So it goes like this:<br><br>4 * 3 = 12<br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>5 + 2*4</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, I'm not really sure about special rules for doing math problems, but I think I would just do this from left to right like I read a book. So first, I would take the 5 and add 2, which gives me 7, and then I think I multiply that by 4. <br><br>So, 7 times 4 is 28. <br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I remember my teacher talking about how we do math problems like this. She said there's a special order we have to follow so that everyone gets the same answer. It's kind of like a rule to solve math puzzles.<br><br>First, we have to do the multiplication and division from left to right before we do any adding or subtracting. It's kind of like when you're playing a game, and there are rules about what moves you can make first.<br><br>So in the problem you gave me, 5 + 2*4, we have to do the multiplication part first. That's the 2*4 part. Two times four is eight.<br><br>Now we replace the 2*4 with 8, and the problem looks like this: 5 + 8.<br><br>Finally, we do the addition part. Five plus eight is thirteen.<br><br>So, the answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure about special rules, but I think I should just solve it from left to right like I read a book! So first I'll add 5 + 2 which is 7, and then I'll multiply 7 by 4 which gives me 28. <br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: My teacher said that when you have a math problem with different things to do like adding and times-ing, you have to do the times-ing before you do the adding. So I should do 2 times 4 first. That's like 2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 2, which is 8.<br><br>After that, I have to do the adding part, which is 5 plus the 8 from before. So 5 plus 8 is 13, because if I start at 5 and count up 8 more (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13), I get to 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

It's like when we play games, there are rules.<br><br>The rule she taught us is that we have to do the multiplication part before we add or subtract. So here, we have to do the 3 times 2 part first.<br><br>So, 3 times 2 is 6.<br><br>Then we take that answer and add it to the 5.<br><br>5 plus 6 is 11.<br><br>That means the whole math problem of 5 plus 3 times 2 equals 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Gosh, okay, I don't really know about any special order we're supposed to do math problems, but I guess I'll just do what makes sense to me:<br><br>First, I think I'll do the multiplication, because that seems more complicated, and then I'll add those numbers together.<br><br>So for 7 times 2, I think that's 14, because 7 plus 7 is 14. <br><br>And then 8 times 5... let me see, 5 plus 5 is 10, and if I do that four times because it's 8 times 5, it should be like 10, 20, 30, 40. <br><br>Okay, so that's 14 and 40. Now I'll add them together!<br><br>14 plus 40 is like 10 plus 40 which is 50, and then 4 more is 54.<br><br>So, I think the answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm not familiar with the order of operations, I'll just do the operations from left to right as they appear.<br><br>First, I multiply 7 by 2, which gives me 14.<br>Then, I add that to the result of multiplying 8 by 5.<br><br>So, 8 multiplied by 5 is 40.<br><br>Now, I add the 14 to the 40 which gives me:<br><br>14 + 40 = 54<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 54.</td>
