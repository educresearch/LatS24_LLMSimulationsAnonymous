      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will follow the order of operations. First, I will solve the addition inside the parentheses. 2 + 5 equals 7. Then, I will multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. Next, I will multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. After that, I will subtract 6 from 12, which equals 6. Finally, I will add 28 and 6 together. <br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will solve the operations in the order they appear from left to right, without using any order of operations. First, I will add 2 and 5, which gives me 7. Then, I will multiply this result by 4, which gives me 28. Next, I will subtract 2 times 3, which gives me 6. Finally, I will add 12 to 28, which gives me 40. <br><br>The answer is 40.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. First, we need to simplify what is inside the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5, which equals 7. Next, we move on to the multiplication. We have 4 multiplied by 7, which equals 28. Then, we have 2 multiplied by 3, which equals 6. Lastly, we do the addition and subtraction. 28 plus 12 equals 40, and then subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34. <br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
