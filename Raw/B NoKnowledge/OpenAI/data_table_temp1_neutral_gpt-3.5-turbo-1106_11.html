      <td>GPT Response: Umm, I don't know what to do here. Can you help me? I think I'll just add 2 and 5 to get 7, then multiply by 4 to get 28. Then I'll just add 12 to get 40, then subtract 2 to get 38, and then multiply by 3 to get 114. So, the answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I solve what's inside the parentheses. 2 + 5 equals 7. Then I do the multiplication first, so 4 * 7 equals 28. Then I do the multiplication and subtraction in order from left to right, so 28 + 12 - 2 * 3 equals 28 + 12 - 6 which equals 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I do the operations inside the parentheses. So, 2+5 is 7. Then, I multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. After that, I add 28 to 12 to get 40. Finally, I subtract 2 times 3, which is 6, from 40 to get 34. So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I'll do the operations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7. Then I'll perform the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28. After that, I'll do the multiplication: 2 * 3 = 6. Finally, I'll add and subtract the remaining numbers: 28 + 12 - 6 = 34. So, the answer is 34.</td>
