gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, we need to simplify the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we have 2+5 which equals 7. Now we have 4*(7)+12-2*3. 

Next, we need to do the multiplication. We have 4*(7) which equals 28, and 2*3 which equals 6. Our expression simplifies to 28+12-6. 

Finally, we can do the addition and subtraction from left to right. We have 28+12 which equals 40, and 40-6 which equals 34. 

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to follow the order of operations. First, I solve what's inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5. That equals 7. 

Next, I multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. 

Then, I add 12 to 28, which equals 40. 

After that, I multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. 

Finally, I subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34. 

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: So, let's break down the problem step by step. First, we have the expression 4*(2+5). Since we don't know about the order of operations, we can start by just multiplying 4 by the sum of 2 and 5, which equals 28.

Next, we have +12, so we add 12 to 28, which gives us 40.

Then, we have -2*3. Since we don't know about the order of operations, we can simply multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6, and then subtract 6 from 40, which gives us 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we need to solve the operations inside the parentheses, which is 2+5. The sum is 7.
Then, we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28.
After that, we have to solve the multiplication 2*3, which equals 6.
Next, we add 12 to 28, which gives us 40.
Finally, we subtract the multiplication result, 6, from 40, and the final answer is 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to use the order of operations. First, we multiply 4 and 3 which gives us 12. Then, we add 2 to the result. So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will follow the order of operations (PEMDAS). Since there are no parentheses or exponents, I will start by multiplying 4 and 3, which gives me 12. Then, I will add 2 to 12, which gives me a final answer of 14.

Therefore, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: Um, I don't really know much about order of operations, but I'll try my best. I think I'll just do the operations from left to right. So first, I'll multiply 4 by 3 which equals 12. And then I'll add 2 to that, which equals 14. So, I think the answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will start by multiplying 4 and 3, which equals 12. Then, I will add 2 to get the final answer. So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to use the order of operations. First, we multiply 2 and 4. 2 times 4 is 8. Then, we add 5 to 8. 5 plus 8 is 13. So, the answer is 13.","GPT Response: First, I will start by multiplying 2 and 4, which equals 8. Then, I will add 5 to 8, which equals 13. So, the answer is 13.","GPT Response: Um, I don't really know much about order of operations, but I'll try my best. I think I'll just do the operations from left to right. So first, I'll add 5 and 2 which equals 7. And then I'll multiply 7 by 4, which equals 28. So, um, the answer is 28.","GPT Response: Hmm, let's see. The question is 5+2*4. Hmm, I guess I'll just do it from left to right. So, 5 plus 2 is 7 and then times 4 is... 28. 
The answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to use the order of operations. First, we multiply 3 and 2. 3 times 2 is 6. Then, we add 5 to 6. 5 plus 6 is 11. So, the answer is 11.","GPT Response: First, we need to multiply 3 and 2 which gives us 6. Then we add 5 to 6. 
The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Um, I don't really know much about order of operations, but I'll try my best. I think I'll just do the operations from left to right. So first, I'll add 5 and 3 which equals 8. And then I'll multiply 8 by 2, which equals 16. So, um, the answer is 16.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will start by using my counting skills. First, I will add 5 and 3, which equals 8. Then, I will multiply the result by 2. So, the answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to follow the order of operations. First, I need to multiply 7 and 2, which gives me 14. Then, I need to multiply 8 and 5, which gives me 40. Finally, I need to add 14 and 40 to get the final answer. The answer is 54.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). 

First, I don't have any parentheses or exponents, so I move on to the multiplication and division. I see that I have two multiplication operations: 7*2 and 8*5. 

From left to right, I start with 7*2, which is equal to 14. Then, I move on to 8*5, which equals 40.

Now that I have solved the multiplication operations, I am left with addition. I need to add 14 and 40 together.

14 + 40 = 54

Therefore, the answer is 54.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will use my addition and multiplication skills. First, I will multiply 7 and 2 because multiplication comes before addition. So, 7 times 2 is 14. Then, I will multiply 8 and 5, which is 40. Finally, I will add 14 and 40 together to get my final answer. The answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, I need to multiply 7 by 2, which equals 14. Then, I need to multiply 8 by 5, which equals 40. Lastly, I need to add 14 and 40 together. The answer is 54."
