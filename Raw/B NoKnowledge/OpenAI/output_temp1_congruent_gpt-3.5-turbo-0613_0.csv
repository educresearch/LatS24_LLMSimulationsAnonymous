systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: First, I will perform the operations inside the parentheses. So, 2 + 5 is equal to 7.
Next, I will multiply 4 by 7 which equals 28.
Then, I will multiply 2 by 3 which equals 6.
After that, I will subtract 6 from 12, which equals 6.
Finally, I will add 28 and 6, giving the final answer of 34.
The answer is 34."
