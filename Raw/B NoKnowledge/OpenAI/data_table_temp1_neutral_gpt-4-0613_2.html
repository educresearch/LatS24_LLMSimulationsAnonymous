      <td>GPT Response: First, I would add 2 and 5 together because they're inside the brackets, which gives me 7. Then I would multiply that by 4, giving me 28. After that, I would add 12 to 28, so that's 40. Lastly, I would subtract 2 times 3, which is 6, from 40. So the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, let's do the addition part. 2 plus 5 equals 7. <br>Then, we multiply 4 times the result which is 7, resulting in 28.<br>The next part tells us to add 12 so 28 plus 12 is 40. <br>Finally, we subtract 2 times 3 from 40. 2 times 3 equals to 6. Now, we subtract 6 from 40.<br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I'll add the numbers in the parentheses, 2 + 5 which is 7. Then I'll multiply the answer, 7 by 4, which is 28. After that, I'll add 28 to 12, so that's 40. Lastly, I'll subtract the result of 2 multiplied by 3 (which is 6) from 40. So,<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I would just go in the order it's written! So, do 4 times 2, which equals 8. Then add 5, and it's 13. Then add 12, and it's 25. Then subtract 2 times 3 (which is 6), and it's 19. <br><br>The answer is 19.</td>
