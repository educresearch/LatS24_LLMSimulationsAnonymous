gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. First, we need to do the calculations inside the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5 which equals 7. 

Now, we will multiply 4 by 7 which equals 28. 

Next, we will multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. 

Then, we will subtract 6 from 12, which equals 6. 

Finally, we will add 28 and 6, which equals 34. 

So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to use the order of operations, which is a set of rules that tells me the correct order to solve math problems. 

The order of operations is: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Let's start by solving the parentheses first. Inside the parentheses, I have 2 + 5. This gives me a sum of 7.

Next, I need to do the multiplication. I have 4 * 7, which equals 28.

Now, let's simplify the rest of the problem. I have 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.

I need to multiply 2 * 3 first. That gives me 6.

Then, I can add 28 + 12, which equals 40.

Finally, I can subtract 6 from 40. This gives me the final answer.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To find the answer, I would start by solving the operations inside parentheses first. Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5, which equals 7. 

Next, I would multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. 

Then, I would solve the multiplication operation, 2 * 3, which equals 6. 

Now, I would add and subtract the remaining numbers in the expression. 

28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 6 equals 34. 

So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we need to do the calculations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7. 

Then, we multiply 4 by the result of the parentheses: 4 * 7 equals 28. 

Next, we add 12 to the previous result: 28 + 12 equals 40. 

Then, we need to do the multiplication: 2 * 3 equals 6. 

Finally, we subtract 6 from the previous result: 40 - 6 equals 34. 

The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations tells us to perform the multiplication first and then the addition. So, we start by multiplying 4 and 3, which equals 12. Then, we add 2 to 12, which equals 14. 
Therefore, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will first multiply 4 and 3, which equals 12. Then, I will add 2 to 12, which equals 14. So the answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I would first do the multiplication part, which is 4 * 3. That gives us 12. Then, I would add 2 to the result. So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to multiply 4 by 3 first, and then add 2. 

So, 4 times 3 is 12. 

Then, we add 2 to that. 

So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. The operation with the highest priority is multiplication, so we need to multiply 2 by 4 first. After multiplying, we add 5 to the result. Therefore, the answer is 13.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will first multiply 2 and 4, which equals 8. Then, I will add 5 to 8, which equals 13. 
The answer is 13.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I would first do the multiplication part, which is 2 * 4. Multiplication means adding a number to itself a certain number of times. So, 2 * 4 means adding 2 four times. 

I would start with 2, and then add 2 to it three more times. So, 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 equals 8.

After that, I would do the addition part of the expression. So, 5 + 8 equals 13.

Therefore, the answer is 13.","GPT Response: First, I add 5 and 2, which gives me 7. Then I multiply 7 by 4, which gives me 28. 
The answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations tells us to perform the multiplication before the addition. So, we need to multiply 3 by 2 first. 

3 multiplied by 2 is 6. 

Then, we add 5 to 6. 

5 plus 6 is 11. 

So, the answer is 11.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will first multiply 3 and 2, which equals 6. Then, I will add 5 to the result, which equals 11. So, the answer is 11.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I would first do the multiplication part, which is 3 * 2. Multiplication means adding a number to itself multiple times. So, 3 * 2 means adding 3 two times, which is 6.
Then, I would add 5 to the result of the multiplication, which is 6. So, 5 + 6 is equal to 11.
Therefore, the answer to the question is 11.","GPT Response: First, I add 5 and 3, which gives me 8. Then I multiply 8 by 2, which equals 16. 
So, the answer is 16."
