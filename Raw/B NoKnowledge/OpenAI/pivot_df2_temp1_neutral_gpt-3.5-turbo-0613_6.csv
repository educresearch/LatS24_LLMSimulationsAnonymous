gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: When solving this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. We start by adding 2 and 5, which gives us 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. Next, we add 12 to 28, which gives us 40. Finally, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which equals 6, from 40. 

So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will follow the order of operations (PEMDAS) which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

First, I will solve the expression inside the parentheses, which is 2+5. This equals 7. 

Next, I will multiply 4 by the result of the expression inside the parentheses, which is 4*7. This equals 28. 

Then, I will multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. 

After that, I will subtract 6 from 12, which equals 6. 

Lastly, I will add the results of the multiplication and subtraction, which is 28+6. This equals 34. 

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we should follow the order of operations.

First, we start with the parentheses. In this case, we have (2+5), which equals 7.

Next, we do the multiplication and division from left to right. So, we have 4 * 7, which equals 28.

Then, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So, we have 28 + 12, which equals 40.

Finally, we have 40 - 2 * 3. We should start with the multiplication, so we have 2 * 3, which equals 6. Then we have 40 - 6, which equals 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to do the operations in the order they appear. First, I see there are parentheses, so I need to add what's inside them first, which is 2 + 5 = 7. Then, I multiply 4 by 7, which gives me 28. Next, I have to add 12 to 28, which gives me 40. Finally, I subtract 2 times 3, which is 6, from 40. So the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this math problem, we need to follow the order of operations. First, we perform the multiplication, which is 4 times 3. This gives us 12. Then, we add 2 to the result, which is 12 plus 2. The answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to do the multiplication first, and then the addition. So, I multiply 4 by 3, which is equal to 12. Then, I add 2 to the result, which is 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will start by multiplying 4 and 3 since it comes before addition in the order of operations. 4 times 3 is 12. Then I will add 2 to 12 because addition comes after multiplication. So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to calculate multiplication first and then addition. 
So, multiplying 4 and 3 gives us 12. 
Next, we add 2 to 12, which gives us 14.
Therefore, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: To solve this math problem, we need to follow the order of operations. First, we perform the multiplication, which is 2 times 4. This gives us 8. Then, we add 5 to the result of the multiplication. So, the answer is 13.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to do the operations in the order they appear. First, I will multiply 2 by 4, which gives me 8. Then, I will add 5 to the result, which gives me 13. 
The answer is 13.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will start by adding 5 and 2, which equals 7. Then, I will multiply 7 by 4, which equals 28. So, the answer is 28.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to calculate multiplication before addition. So, first we multiply 2 and 4, and then we add 5 to the result. 
2 * 4 = 8
5 + 8 = 13
The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: To solve this math problem, we need to follow the order of operations. First, we perform the multiplication, which is 3 times 2. This gives us 6. Then, we add 5 to the result of the multiplication. So, the answer is 11.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). 

However, since I don't know about the order of operations, I will just solve the problem from left to right. 

First, I add 5 and 3, which equals 8. 

Then, I multiply 8 by 2, which equals 16. 

Therefore, the answer is 16.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will start by adding 5 and 3 since it comes first. So, 5 + 3 equals 8. Then, I will multiply 8 by 2. 8 times 2 equals 16. So, the answer is 16.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to calculate multiplication before addition. So, first we multiply 3 and 2, and then we add 5 to the result. 
3 * 2 = 6 
5 + 6 = 11 
Therefore, the answer is 11."

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to follow the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS. According to this rule, I need to perform the multiplication before addition. Therefore, I will first multiply 7 by 2 and then 8 by 5. 

7 * 2 = 14 
8 * 5 = 40 

Now, I can add the two results together. 

14 + 40 = 54 

So, the answer is 54.","GPT Response: Well, I don't really know how to do this, but I think I can just do the calculations from left to right. 
So, 7 times 2 is 14, and then 14 plus 8 is 22. Finally, 22 times 5 is 110.
So, I think the answer is 110.","GPT Response: First, we solve the multiplication from left to right. 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40. Then, we add the two products together. 14 plus 40 is 54.
