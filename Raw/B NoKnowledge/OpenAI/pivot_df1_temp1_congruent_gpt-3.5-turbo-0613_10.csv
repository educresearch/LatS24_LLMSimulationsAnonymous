gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS). 
1. First, we need to solve inside the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5, which equals 7.
2. Next, we need to do the multiplication. We have 4 * 7, which equals 28.
3. Then, we can add the remaining numbers. We have 28 + 12, which equals 40.
4. Finally, we need to do the subtraction. We have 40 - 2 * 3. We need to do the multiplication first, so we have 2 * 3, which equals 6. Then, we can subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34.

The answer is 34."
