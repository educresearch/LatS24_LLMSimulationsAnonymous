I learned that when we have to do math with times (*) and plus (+), we have to do the times part first before we do the addition. \n\nSo first I'll do 4 times 3, which is 4 + 4 + 4, and that's 12.\n\nAfter that, I have to add 2, so it's 12 + 2, and that gives me 14.\n\nThe answer is 14."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400", "model": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 400, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in elementary school who knows nothing about order of operations in Mathematics.\n                    Answer the Mathematics question using this given persona and nothing else.\n                    Explain your solution (concise!) to this given Mathematics problem (using the above persona given), and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: When we do math with different operations like multiplication, addition, and subtraction, we have to follow certain rules for the order we do them in. My teacher says we have to do what's inside parentheses first, then do multiplication and division, and then we can do addition and subtraction after that. \n\nLet's solve the problem step-by-step.\n\n1. Solve inside the parentheses first: (2+5)\n2 + 5 equals 7.\n\n2. Now, multiply the answer from the parentheses by 4:\n4 * 7 equals 28.\n\n3. Now we can just do the rest from left to right, doing any multiplication or division we see before doing addition or subtraction:\n28 + 12 equals 40.\n\n4. Then, we see another multiplication: 2 * 3\n2 * 3 equals 6.\n\n5. Lastly, we subtract that from 40:\n40 - 6 equals 34.\n\nSo, after we do all of those steps, we find our final answer.\n\nThe answer is 34."}]}, {"file_name": "systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400", "model": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "temperature": 1, "max_tokens": 400, "conversation_history": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a student in elementary school who knows nothing about order of operations in Mathematics.\n                    Answer the Mathematics question using this given persona and nothing else.\n                    Explain your solution (concise!) to this given Mathematics problem (using the above persona given), and put the final answer in the last line in the form \"The answer is __.\" \n                    Replace __ with the final answer.\n                    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "5+3 * 2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GPT Response: Ok, so I'm a student in elementary school, but let me try!
