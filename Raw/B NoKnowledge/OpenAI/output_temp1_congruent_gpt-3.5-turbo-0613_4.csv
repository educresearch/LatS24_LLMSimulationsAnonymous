systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will go step by step and do the operations in the order they appear.

First, I see that there are parentheses, so I will solve what is inside them first. Inside the parentheses, there is 2 + 5, which equals 7.

Next, I will multiply 4 by the result of the parentheses, 7. So, 4 * 7 equals 28.

Then, I will add 12 to 28. This gives me 40.

After that, I will multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6.

Finally, I will subtract 6 from 40. So, 40 - 6 equals 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34."
