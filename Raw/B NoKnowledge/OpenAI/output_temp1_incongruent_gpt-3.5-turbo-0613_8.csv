systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to follow the order of operations. First, I need to solve what's inside the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, there is 2 + 5, which equals 7. So, the expression becomes 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Next, I need to do the multiplication and division from left to right. There are two multiplications: 4 * 7 and 2 * 3. So, I solve those first. 4 * 7 equals 28, and 2 * 3 equals 6. Now, the expression becomes 28 + 12 - 6.

Finally, I need to do the addition and subtraction from left to right. The first operation is addition, so I add 28 + 12, which equals 40. Then, I subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34.

The answer is 34."
