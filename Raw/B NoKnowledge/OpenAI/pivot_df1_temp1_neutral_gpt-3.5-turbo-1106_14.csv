gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: I think you just do the operations from left to right. So for 5+2*4, you would first do 5+2 which is 7, and then multiply 7 by 4 which is 28. 
The answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Umm, okay, so I think you just do the multiplication first, and then the addition. So, it's like 7 times 2 plus 8 times 5. 
Then it's 14 plus 40!
The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Umm, I'm not sure, but I think you just do the things from left to right? So, I'll first do 4*3 which is 12. Then I'll add 2 to that, which gives me 14. So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,GPT Response: I don't know how to solve this using order of operations.
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this. Can you please explain it to me?
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: First, I will do the multiplication first, so 2*4 equals 8. Then I will add 5 to 8. So, 5+2*4 equals 13.
The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: First, I'll just do the operations from left to right. I'll start by doing 7*2, which is 14. Then I'll do 8*5, which is 40. Then I'll add 14 and 40 together, and I get 54. 

The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: First, you need to do the multiplication before the addition. So, 4*3 equals 12. Then you add 2. So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses. 2+5 equals 7. 

Then, we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28.

Next, we do the operations outside the parentheses. We multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6.

Afterwards, we add 12 and 6, which equals 18.

Finally, we add 28 and 18, which equals 46.

So, the answer is 46."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3*2,"GPT Response: First, you need to do the multiplication before the addition. So, you do 3*2 first, which equals 6. Then you do 5+6, which equals 11.
The answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Umm, I think you just do the math from left to right. So, 5 plus 2 is 7, and then times 4 is 28. So, the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication. So, 7*2 is 14 and 8*5 is 40. Then you add 14 and 40 together. 
The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Umm, I think you just do the operations from left to right. So, 4 times 3 is 12, and then you add 2 to that. So the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Umm, so first you do what's inside the parentheses, which is 2+5. That's 7. Then you multiply 4 by 7 and get 28. After that, you do the multiplication of 2 by 3, which is 6. Then you just add 12 and subtract 6. So the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Umm, I think you just do the math from left to right. So, 5 plus 3 is 8, and then times 2 is 16. So, the answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2*4,"GPT Response: So, first I add 5 and 2 together to get 7. Then, I multiply 7 by 4 to get 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: So, first I'll do 7 times 2, which equals 14. Then, I'll do 8 times 5, which equals 40. And finally, I'll add 14 and 40 together. So, the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*3+2,"GPT Response: So, first I do the multiplication which is 4*3, and my answer is 12. Then I add 2 to 12 and my final answer is 14. So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, we can add the numbers inside the parentheses:
4*(2+5) + 12 - 2*3
= 4*(7) + 12 - 2*3
= 28 + 12 - 2*3
= 40 - 2*3
Next, we do the multiplication:
40 - 2*3
= 40 - 6
Finally, we do the subtraction:
40 - 6
= 34
So the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+3*2,"GPT Response: So, first I add 5 and 3 together to get 8. Then, I multiply 8 by 2 to get 16. 

The answer is 16."
