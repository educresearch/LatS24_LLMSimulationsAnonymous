      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to pay attention to the order of operations. I will start with the parentheses first. Inside the parentheses, 2 + 5 equals 7. <br><br>Next, I will multiply 4 by 7, which gives me 28. <br><br>Then, I will move on to the addition and subtraction. I will add 12 to 28, which gives me 40.

      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to follow the order of operations known as PEMDAS. This stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>First, I will solve the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.<br><br>Now, I will multiply 4 by 7: 4 * 7 = 28.<br><br>Next, I will multiply 2 by 3: 2 * 3 = 6.<br><br>Then, I will add 12 to 28: 12 + 28 = 40.<br><br>Lastly, I will subtract 6 from 40: 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>Therefore, the final answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we can follow the order of operations. First, we look for any operations inside parentheses. In this case, we have 2 + 5, which equals 7. <br>Then, we perform multiplication and division from left to right. We have 4 * 7, which equals 28. <br>Next, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right. We have 28 + 12 - 2 * 3. <br>Finally, we perform multiplication, which is 2 * 3, resulting in 6. <br>Then, we perform addition from left to right, which is 28 + 12 - 6. <br>Lastly, we perform subtraction from left to right, which is 40 - 6. <br>The answer is 34.</td>
