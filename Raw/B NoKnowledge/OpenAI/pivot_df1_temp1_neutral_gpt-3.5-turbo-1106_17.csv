gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Umm, I think I just need to do the operations from left to right. So, 5 + 2 equals 7, and then I multiply that by 4, which gives me 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Umm, I'm not really sure, but I think you just do the operations from left to right. So it's like 7*2=14, and then 14+8*5. And then 8*5=40, so it's 14+40. 
The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Umm, I think I just need to do the operations from left to right. So, 4*3 is 12, and then I add 2 to that, which is 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,GPT Response: I don't know what that means.
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Umm, I think I just need to do the operations from left to right. So, 5 + 3 equals 8, and then 8 times 2 equals 16. So, the answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2*4,"GPT Response: First, I will perform the multiplication which is 2*4 and then add the result to 5. So, 2*4 equals 8 and when you add 5 to 8, you get 13. 

The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: First, perform the multiplication.
7*2 = 14
8*5 = 40
Then, add the results together.
14 + 40 = 54
The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: First, I will perform the multiplication which is 4*3 and then add the result to 2. So, 4*3 equals 12 and when you add 2 to 12, you get 14. 
The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, I will just solve what's inside the parentheses. 2+5 is 7. Then, I do the multiplication first, so 4*7 is 28. After that, I do the remaining operations from left to right: 28+12 is 40, and 40-2*3 is 34. 

The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3*2,"GPT Response: First, I will perform the multiplication which is 3*2 and then add the result to 5. So, 3*2 equals 6 and when you add 5 to 6, you get 11. 

The answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2*4,"GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication 2*4 which equals 8. Then we add 5+8 which equals 13. So the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Um, I think I just need to do the multiplication first and then add the numbers, so it's like 14 + 40, and um, the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3+2,"GPT Response: First, we do 4 times 3, which equals 12. Then we add 2 to that, and that equals 14. So the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, we do the operation inside the parentheses, which is 2+5=7. Then we do the multiplication outside the parentheses, which is 4*7=28. After that, we do the multiplication of 2*3, which is 6. Then we add 12 to 28, which is 40. Finally, we subtract 6 from 40, which is 34. 

The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3*2,"GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication 3*2 which equals 6. Then we add 5+6. So, the answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2*4,"GPT Response: First, we do the addition, so 5 + 2 is 7. Then we multiply 7 by 4, which equals 28. So the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: First, I have to do the multiplication first before adding.
So 7*2 equals 14 and 8*5 equals 40.
Then I add 14 and 40 together.
So the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*3+2,"GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication, so 4*3 equals 12. Then we add 2 to 12. The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: First, I multiplied 4 by the result of 2 + 5, which is 28. Then, I added 12 to that, which is 40. After that, I multiplied 2 by 3, which is 6. Then, I subtracted that from 40, which gives us 34.

So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+3*2,"GPT Response: First, we do the addition of 5 and 3, which is 8. Then we multiply the result by 2, and that gives us 16. 

The answer is 16."
