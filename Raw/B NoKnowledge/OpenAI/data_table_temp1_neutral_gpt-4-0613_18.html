      <td>4*(2+5)+12-2*3</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I would solve the problem step-by-step as:<br><br>First, I would do the addition in the parentheses: 4 * (2+5) becomes 4 * 7.<br><br>Then, I will multiply: 4 * 7 is 28.<br><br>Continue with the equation: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, I would add: 28 + 12 becomes 40.<br><br>And then subtract: 40 - 2 * 3 becomes 40 - 6.<br><br>Lastly, I subtract to get the final answer: 40 - 6 is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, add the numbers inside the parentheses: 4*(2+5) becomes 4*7. Then, multiply 4 and 7 together, getting 28. <br><br>Next, subtract 2 times 3 from 28 plus 12. Adding 12 to 28 gives us 40.<br><br>Finally, subtract 2 times 3, which is 6, from 40. <br><br>So, 40 - 6 equals 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I would just solve it from left to right, like how I read a book or how I count. So, the sum would go like this:<br><br>Firstly, I multiply 4 with 2 which equals 8.<br><br>Secondly, add 5 to 8 and I get 13.<br><br>Next, add 12 to 13 and I get 25.<br><br>Then, subtract 2 from 25 and I get 23.<br><br>Lastly, multiply 23 by 3 and I get 69.<br><br>The answer is 69.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: So, I would start with adding numbers inside the brackets. So, 2+5 equals 7. Then, the problem becomes 4*7+12-2*3. <br><br>Next, I would multiply. So 4 times 7 is 28 and 2 times 3 is 6. So, then it becomes 28+12-6.<br><br>Then, I would add 28 and 12 together. So, 28 plus 12 is 40. <br><br>Last, I would subtract 6 from 40 which equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would calculate the problem from left to right, just as if I was reading a book. <br><br>First, I would multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then I would add the 2 to the 12.<br><br>This would result in 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: So, I would start with the multiplication first because multiplication comes first in the saying 'Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right.' Then, I would do the addition. <br><br>The multiplication is 4*3 which equals 12. After that, I add the result of the multiplication to 2. This is 12+2 which equals 14. <br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I know! Let's solve it from left to right just like how I would read. First, let's multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then, let's add 2 to 12 and we will get 14! <br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I'm going to do the multiplication because multiplication is fun and fast. So, 4 times 3 is 12. Then, I'm going to add the 2 to the 12, which makes 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: As I don't know the order of operations, I would just follow the equation from left to right. <br><br>First, I would add 5 to 2 getting a result of 7. Then, I would multiply this result by 4.<br><br>7*4 is equal to 28. <br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: So, I would start by adding 5 and 2, which gives me 7. Then I multiply 7 by 4. That gives me 28. The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I know! Let's just go from left to right like reading a book. First, 5 plus 2 is 7. Then, 7 times 4 is 28. <br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I add 5 and 2 because they are the numbers I see first. This equals 7. Then, I multiply the 7 by 4. That equals 28. Therefore:<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: So, I would start with the addition operation because it comes first in the equation. So, 5 + 3 is 8. Then, I would multiply 8 by 2, which is 16. Therefore, 5 + 3 * 2 is 16. <br><br>The answer is 16.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I know! Let's just do it from left to right. <br><br>First, we add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then, we need to multiply 8 by 2, which is 16. <br><br>That was easy! The answer is 16.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I think what you do is simply solve it from left to right like how we read a book. So, you first add 5 + 3 which equals to 8. And then you would multiply 8 by 2. So, that would give you 16.<br><br>The answer is 16.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: First, you multiply 7 by 2, which equals 14. Then you multiply 8 by 5, which equals 40. Once you have these results, you add them together. So, 14 plus 40 equals 54.<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a student without the knowledge of the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would solve this math problem from left to right, the same way I read a book.<br><br>First, I multiply 7 by 2 which equals 14.<br><br>Second, I add 14 (from the first step) to 8 which equals 22.<br><br>Finally, I multiply 22 by 5 which equals 110.<br><br>The answer is 110.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I'm going to multiply 7 by 2, which gives me 14. Then, I'm going to multiply 8 by 5, which gives me 40. Afterward, I will add the two answers together, which is 14 plus 40. The total of these sums up to 54.<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
