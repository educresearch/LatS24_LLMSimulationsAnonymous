      <td>GPT Response: First, I would add 2 and 5 together which would give 7. After that, I would multiply 4 by the 7 which would give 28. Then I would add 12 to 28 which would give 40. And finally, I would subtract 2 times 3 from 40 which would give 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First off, I'm going to do the addition inside of the brackets. So 2 plus 5 makes 7. And now it becomes, 4 times 7 plus 12 minus 2 times 3. <br><br>Next, let's do the multiplication parts. 4 times 7 is 28. Then, 2 times 3 equals to 6. So now, it looks like 28 plus 12 minus 6.<br><br>Finally, let's do the adding and subtracting. 28 plus 12 gives us 40. 40 minus 6 gives us 34.<br><br>So, the final answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I'll add 2 and 5 because they are inside the parentheses. So, 2+5 equals 7. <br><br>Next, I'll multiply 4 by the sum I got which is 7. Therefore, 4*7 equals 28.<br><br>After that, I'll subtract 2 from 12. So, 12-2 equals 10.<br><br>Then, I'll multiply 2 by 3. Therefore, 2*3 equals 6.<br><br>Finally, I'll combine all my results. So, 28+10-6 equals 32.<br><br>So, the answer is 32.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I do the multiplication and addition inside the parenthesis, which is 2 plus 5, equalling 7. Then I multiply the 4 outside the parenthesis with the resulting 7 from the sum inside the parenthesis which is 28. After that, I add to it the 12. The answer becomes 40. Then I subtract from it the product of 2 times 3 which is 6. So, 40 minus 6 is 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
