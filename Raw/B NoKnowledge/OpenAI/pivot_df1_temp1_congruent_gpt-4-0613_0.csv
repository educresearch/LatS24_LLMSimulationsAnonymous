gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: As a 6th grader who is not familiar with the order of operations, I would likely solve the problem from left to right, just as I read a sentence. 

First, I would add 5 and 2 to get 7.
Then, I would multiply 7 by 4 to get 28.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I will just calculate from left to right. First, I will multiply 7 by 2, which gives 14. Then, I will add 8 to 14, which gives 22. Finally, I will multiply 22 by 5, which gives 110. 

The answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: As a 6th grade student who is not familiar with the order of operations, I would likely solve the problem from left to right, just as I read a sentence. 

First, I would multiply 4 and 3 to get 12.
Then, I would add 2 to 12 to get 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, I'll just add and subtract numbers from left to right. 

So firstly, I'll do 4*(2 + 5) which is 4*7 and I will get 28.
Then, I'll take this 28 and add 12 to it, giving me 40.
And finally, I'll subtract 2*3 from 40, which gives me 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: As a 6th grader who is not familiar with the order of operations, I would solve this math problem by doing the operations from left to right as they appear. 

First, I would do the addition operation:

5 + 3 = 8.

Then, I would multiply the result by 2:

8 * 2 = 16.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: First, I'll add the 5 and 2 together to get 7. Then, I'll multiply the 7 by 4 to get 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: First, I'll multiply each of the multiplication problems and write down the solutions: 7*2 equals 14 and 8*5 equals 40. Then, I will add together those numbers: 14 plus 40 equals 54.

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, I'll multiply 4 and 3 together because when I see a multiplication sign, I thinks that's what I need to do first. So, 4 times 3 equals 12. 

Then, I'll add the result, which is 12, to 2 because I see a plus sign next. So, 12 plus 2 equals 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, I will add the numbers within the brackets, so 2 + 5 = 7. Then, I will multiply 4 with that result, so 4 * 7 = 28. After that, I will subtract 2*3 from 12, so 12 - 6 = 6. Lastly, I will add that number to 28 to get the final result, so 28 + 6 = 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Since I am a grade 6 student and I don't know the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will simply solve this from left to right. 

First I'll add 5 + 3, which equals 8. Then I'll multiply that by 2, which equals 16. 

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would calculate from left to right. So, I would first add five and two to get seven. Then, I multiply seven by four which equals twenty-eight. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would just solve the problem from left to right. 

First I multiply 7 by 2, which gives 14. 

Then I add 8 to 14, that gives 22.

Lastly, I multiply 22 by 5, that gives 110.

The answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would calculate from left to right. So, I would first multiply 4 by 3, which gives me 12. Then, I would add 2 to my result. Here's my calculation:

4*3 = 12 
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: I would first go ahead and add the numbers in the bracket together because the equation said that we have to do that first, so that will give me 4*7. 

Then I will do that multiplication operation which equals 28. 

Then, seeing that nothing else can be done to the bracket, I'll move on to the other operations. 

So, I was left with ""28 + 12 - 2*3"". 

I'd simply add 12 to 28 to give 40 because that's the next operation I see.

Then subtract 2 from the 40 obtained above which equals 38. 

Lastly, I'd multiply 38 by 3 to get the final answer. 

The answer is 114."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would calculate from left to right. So, I would first add five and three to get eight. Then, I multiply eight by two which equals sixteen. So, my answer will be that.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: As an elementary student, I would just add and multiply numbers in the way they appear. So, I would do 5 + 2 which equals 7 and then multiply it to 4. That is 7 times 4, equals to 28.
The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Since I didn't learn the order of operations yet, I will just solve it from left to right. 

First, I will multiply 7 and 2 which gives me 14. Then, I will add 8 to it which results in 22. Finally, I will multiply 22 and 5 which is 110.

The answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, I'm going to add the numbers 3 and 2 together, because I know how to do that. That gives me 5. Then, I'll multiply 4 by 5. That gives me 20. 

The answer is 20."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, I'll add 2 + 5, which gives 7. Now the problem looks like 4*7 + 12 - 2*3. 

Next, I'll do the multiplication: so 4*7 gives 28 and 2*3 gives 6. The problem now becomes 28 + 12 - 6. 

Then, I add 28 and 12 together to get 40. The problem becomes 40 - 6.

Finally, I subtract 6 from 40 and get 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: As an elementary student with no knowledge of the order of operations in Mathematics, I will solve this problem from left to right. 

So:

First step: 5 + 3 = 8

Second step: 8 * 2 = 16

The answer is 16."
