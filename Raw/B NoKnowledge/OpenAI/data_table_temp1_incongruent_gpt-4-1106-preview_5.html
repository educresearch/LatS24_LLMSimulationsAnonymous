      <td>GPT Response: Okay, since I'm a grade 6 student and I don't know about order of operations, I might try to solve this just by going from left to right. So here's what I would do:<br><br>I see 4 times something in parentheses first, so I think I need to do that part first (I remember parenthesis are important). Inside the parentheses is 2+5. I know 2+5 is 7. So now I have:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>If I just continue left to right:<br><br>4 * 7 is 28, then I add 12, which is 40. <br>Next, 40 minus 2 is 38, and then I have to multiply the last part.<br>38 times 3... but this is a bit tricky, because I don't usually see a number right next to a multiplication. Maybe, I think, I should just multiply the 2 from before by 3 first, which is 6.<br><br>So, if I take 40 (from earlier) and subtract 6 (2 * 3), I would get 34.<br><br>So my final answer would probably be: The answer is 34. <br><br>(Note: This is not the correct answer following the order of operations known as PEMDAS - Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). The student's persona assumes a naive approach to the problem-solving process without this knowledge.)</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, if I haven't learned about the order of operations yet, I might not know the exact rules, but I can try to solve this step by step. I do know that I should probably do something with what's inside the parentheses first!<br><br>So, I see there's a part in parentheses: (2+5). I'll add those numbers together first because it just seems right to deal with what's inside parenthesis first.<br><br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now I'll replace the (2+5) in the problem with 7:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I'm going to just work from left to right since I don't know the specific rules.<br><br>Starting with 4 * 7:<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br><br>Now the problem looks like this:<br><br>28 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, working left to right, I'll add 28 and 12:<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>Now I have:<br><br>40 - 2 * 3<br><br>I'll subtract 2 from 40 first:<br><br>40 - 2 = 38<br><br>Finally, I have:<br><br>38 * 3<br><br>Lastly, I'll multiply 38 by 3:<br><br>38 * 3 = 114<br><br>So, if I don't know the order of operations and I just solve step by step from left to right, it looks like I would get:<br><br>The answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I'm not sure about any fancy rules, but I'll just do things as they come to me. First, I see a 4 next to a (2+5), and my teacher said if numbers are next to each other with parentheses, I should probably do that first.<br><br>So, I do 2+5 which is 7.<br><br>Now, it looks like 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, I'll just go left to right because that's how I read!<br><br>So, 4 * 7 is 28.<br><br>And then I add 12 to get 28 + 12 which is 40.<br><br>Then I see - 2 * 3. I guess maybe I subtract the 2 first? So, that's 40 - 2 which is 38.<br><br>And then I multiply by 3... 38 * 3... oh, no, that's a big number. Wait, maybe I multiply the 2 and the 3 first? Like when we did the 4 and the 7. So, 2 * 3 is 6.<br><br>So, my paper now has 28 + 12 - 6 on it.<br><br>Adding up 28 and 12 is 40, and then I subtract 6 from that to get 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! So in school, we learned this cool rule called "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally" or PEMDAS for short. It stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). <br><br>Using this rule, we do what's inside the parentheses first. So we start with:<br><br>4 * (2+5) + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>First, do the parentheses:<br><br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Then, our problem becomes:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3 <br><br>Next, we do the multiplication:<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br><br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>So now we have:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Then we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>And lastly:<br><br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So the answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, since I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I might just solve this from left to right, like I read a book! So I would multiply 4 and 3 first, because that's the first thing I see. <br><br>4 times 3 is 12.<br><br>Then, I add 2 to that because it's next in the question.<br><br>12 plus 2 is 14.<br><br>So if I just go from left to right, the answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, okay, so here's how I think about it. I know that multiplication is something like "times-ing" and addition is like "plus-ing". My teacher said that when you have a math problem, you should do the "times-ing" before the "plus-ing".<br><br>So, for 4 * 3+2, I would first do the 4 times 3 part because that's the "times-ing" I was talking about. So that's:<br><br>4 * 3 = 12<br><br>Now I just have to "plus" the 2:<br><br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>So if I put all that together, the answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think you just do the math from left to right like reading a book. So first, you take 4 times 3 which is 12, and then you add 2. That makes 14. The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh! I think you just add the numbers in the order they appear. So, I'd say you do 4 times 3 first, because that seems like a bigger deal than adding 2. My teacher says that multiplying is like adding over and over, so it's kind of important. <br><br>So, 4 times 3 is like 4 plus 4 plus 4, which is 12. <br><br>Then you just take the 12 and add 2 to it, because the question has a plus sign next to the 2. <br><br>So, 12 plus 2 equals 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, okay, so here's how I think we should do it. First, we do the multiplication part because I heard my teacher say that we need to do that before addition when they're in the same problem. So, we multiply 2 and 4 which gives us 8. After that, we add the 5. So 5 plus 8 is 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think you just do the math from left to right like reading a book. So first, I would add 5 plus 2 which is 7, and then take that 7 and multiply it by 4. So 7 times 4 equals 28. That feels right!<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh! I think you do the adding first because it's first in the question, so 5 plus 2 is 7, and then you multiply by 4. So 7 times 4 is 28.<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, okay, so here's how I think about it. I know that multiplication is something like putting the same number many times. So if I have 3 times 2, it's like having two 3s, which is 3 plus 3. That gives me 6. Then I just have to add that to 5. So if I have 5 and I add 6, I get 11. <br><br>The answer is 11.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, okay! So, I just learned about this thing called "PEMDAS" which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction. It's like the rules for which math things you're supposed to do first.<br><br>First, we don't have any parentheses or exponents here, so we can skip those parts. Next are multiplication and division, which are kind of like a team, and you do them from left to right.

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so even without knowing the official order of operations, let's try to work through the problem step by step. <br><br>First, I see two multiplication signs and addition.

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, so I need to solve this math problem? Well, I think I just do the math from left to right, like how I read! So first I take 7 times 2 which is 14, and then I add 8 which gets me 22, and then I multiply by 5, so 22 times 5... let me work that out.<br><br>So, 22 times 5 would be... 2 times 5 is 10 and 20 times 5 is 100, so I add 10 to 100. That means 22 times 5 is 110! So the answer is 110.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think I heard my teacher say something about doing multiplication before addition. So I should multiply the numbers first and then add them together.<br><br>So first, I would do 7 times 2 which is 14.
