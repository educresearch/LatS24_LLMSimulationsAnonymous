gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: I'll start by adding 5 and 2 because they're next to each other. That gets me 7. Then, I notice there's a times 4, so I multiply 7 by 4 and I get 28.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would just calculate it from left to right.

First, I would multiply 7 times 2, which equals to 14. 

Then, I would add 14 to 8, which equals to 22.

After that, I would multiply 22 times 5, which equals to 110.

So, according to that calculation: 

The answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: I'll start by doing the multiplication first: 4 * 3 is 12. Now, I'll add the 2 to the 12. This gives me a final answer of 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Being a grade 6 student, and not knowing the order of operations rule PEMDAS, you would simply calculate this equation from left to right.

First, you'd multiply 4 and 2: 4 * 2 = 8
The equation then becomes 8+5+12-2 * 3.

Next, you'd add 8 and 5: 8 + 5 = 13
The equation then becomes 13+12-2 * 3.

Then, you'd add 13 and 12: 13 + 12 = 25
The equation then becomes 25-2 * 3.

Later, you'd subtract 2 from 25: 25 - 2 = 23
The equation then becomes 23 * 3.

Lastly, you'd multiply 23 and 3: 23 * 3 = 69.

The answer is 69."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: I'll start by adding 5 and 3 because they're next to each other. That gets me 8. Then, I notice there's a times 2, so I multiply 8 by 2 and I get 16.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations or PEMDAS, I would just solve the problem from left to right. So, I would first add 5 and 2, which equals 7. Then, I would multiply 7 times 4, which equals 28. The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: First, I will multiply 7 by 2 which is 14. Next, I will multiply 8 by 5 which is 40. After that, I will add the products together. So, 14 plus 40 is 54.

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Okay, I don't know about any special order or rules to follow, so here's what I'll do: 
First, I'll solve the multiplication part, because I know that multiplication is just adding a number multiple times. So, 4 times 3, would be 4 plus 4 plus 4 which is 12.
Next, I need to add 12 and the 2 to get the final result.
So, 14 is my final solution!

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, I'll add the numbers in the brackets, 2+5 equals 7.
Next, I'll multiply 4 and 7, which gets me 28.
Then, I'll add 12 to 28, the result is 40.
After that, I'll subtract 2*3=6 from 40.
The final result is 34. 
So, the answer is 34."

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would just solve the problem from left to right as it appears.

First, I would add 5 and 2, which equals to 7. 

Then, I would multiply 7 by 4, which equals to 28.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: As an elementary student with no knowledge of the order of operations, I would solve this problem from left to right because that's how I read. 

First, I would multiply 7 by 2 which equals 14.
Then, I would add 14 and 8 which equals 22.
Lastly, I would multiply 22 by 5, and that's 110.

So, the final answer is 110. 

Note: This is actually incorrect according to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), but it reflects the understanding of a child who hasn't learned this concept yet."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: First, I would multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then, I would add 2 to 12 because after multiplication, the next step I know is addition. So, 12 plus 2 equals 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Well, I haven't learned about order of operations yet. But I know how to add, subtract, multiply and divide. So I'll just solve it from left to right!

Firstly I will do the multiplication, 4 times 2 which equals 8. 
Then, I can add 8 and 5 which equal 13. 
After that, I can add 13 and 12, which equal 25.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: First, I will do the multiplication because times seems like a big word and my parents always tell me to do big things first. So, 4 times 3 is 12. Then, I will add the 2 to it. 12 plus 2 is 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I would just follow the order of the sum as written from left to right. 

So, first I'll solve the operation within the brackets. 2+5 equals 7.

Second, I would take the first part of the equation, 4 * 7, which equals 28.

Then, I would continue down the line. 28+12 equals 40. 

From there, 40-2 equals 38. 

And lastly, 38 * 3 equals 114.

The answer is 114."
