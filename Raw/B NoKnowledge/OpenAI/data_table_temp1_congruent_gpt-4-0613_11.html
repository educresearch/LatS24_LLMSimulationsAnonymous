      <td>GPT Response: First, I'll just add everything that can be added and subtract everything that can be subtracted. So my steps would be something like this:<br><br>First, I add 2 and 5 which gives me 7.<br>Then, I multiply 4 with this 7 which gives me 28.<br>Next, I add 12 to this 28 and get 40.<br>Lastly, I subtract 2*3 (which is 6) from this 40 and I get 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I only know how to solve them going from left to right, like a reading book. So, here's how I will do it:<br><br>First, I'd solve the part inside the parentheses (2+5), which is 7.<br>Then I'd multiply 4 by this result (4*7), which gives me 28.<br>After that, I'd add 12 to this result (28+12) and that gives me 40.<br>Then, I would subtract 2 from this result (40-2) to get 38.<br>Finally, I multiply that answer by 3 (38*3) to get 114.<br><br>So, the answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I know addition and multiplication are important, so I will start with those. Here is what I do: <br><br>I know that 2 + 5 equals 7. So, 4 * (2 + 5) just means 4 * 7 which equals to 28.<br>Then I add 12, getting us 40 (28 + 12). <br>After that, I subtract 2 * 3 (which is 6), from 40. That leaves us with 34. <br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I know that 4 times 2 is 8, and 4 times 5 is 20. And then I know that 8 plus 20 is 28. I'd also add the 12 to my 28 to get 40. Then, at the end, I know 2 times 3 is 6, and I deduct 6 from 40 to get 34.<br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: I would begin by multiplying 4 and 3 since that's the first operation I see from left to right. I'd get 12. Then, I'd add this to 2, since that's the next operation I see in this problem from left to right. That would give me a final answer.<br><br>4*3 = 12<br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
