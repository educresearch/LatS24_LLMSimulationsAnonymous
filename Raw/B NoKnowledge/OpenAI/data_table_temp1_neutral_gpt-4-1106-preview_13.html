      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think my teacher mentioned something about doing math problems in a certain order so that everyone gets the same answer. I remember she talked about doing what's inside the parentheses first, then doing multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction last. I remember she used the phrase "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally" to help us remember the order, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). We don't have exponents in this problem, so I don't need to worry about that part.<br><br>Let's try to solve it using that order:<br><br>1. First, solve the parentheses (2+5)<br>   2 + 5 = 7<br><br>2. Then do the multiplication and division from left to right:<br>   4 * (the result from step 1): 4 * 7 = 28<br>   2 * 3 = 6<br><br>3. Now, do the addition and subtraction from left to right:<br>   Start with the first number, then add and subtract in order:<br>   (result from the first multiplication) + 12 - (result from the second multiplication)<br>   28 + 12 - 6<br>   <br>   Do the addition first:<br>   28 + 12 = 40<br>   <br>   Now subtract:<br>   40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So, after using the order of operations, I got the answer:<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so since I don't know anything about the order of operations, I'm going to do this step by step, just like what I think makes sense!<br><br>First, let's add and subtract things:<br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now let's multiply like this:<br>4 * 7 = 28<br>Cool, now we have this number!<br><br>Then, I know when there are numbers next to each other like 28 and 12, I should add them:<br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>And then, I think I should do the last part:<br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>So, now if I take the 40 and subtract 6, I get:<br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>I think we solved it! So, the final answer is:<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, since I don't know about order of operations, I might just solve it from left to right like I read a book! So...<br><br>First I'll do 4 times 2, which is 8. Then I'll add 5 to that, which makes 13. <br><br>Next, I'll add 12 to 13, and that gives me 25. <br><br>Finally, I'll subtract 2 times 3 from 25. And 2 times 3 is 6, so 25 minus 6 is 19!<br><br>So without knowing the proper rules, I might say:<br><br>The answer is 19.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, let me try to solve this!<br><br>First, I know we have to do the stuff in the parentheses. So we do 2 + 5, and that equals 7.<br><br>Then, we multiply that by 4 because multiplication comes before adding or subtracting. So 4 times 7 is 28.<br><br>After that, we have to add 12 to our result. So, 28 plus 12 equals 40.<br><br>Next, we have to do the subtraction and the other multiplication. We have "- 2 * 3" at the end, which is like saying "2 times 3" first because multiplication is before subtraction. So, 2 times 3 is 6.<br><br>Now we take our 40, and subtract 6 because we already did the multiplication. So, 40 minus 6 equals 34.<br><br>So the answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hm, I think I heard my teacher talk about this once. She said something about doing the multiplying part before adding. So, I guess I should multiply 2 by 4 first, which is 8, and then add the 5. So the final answer would be like this:<br><br>First, I do the multiplication part: 2 * 4 = 8<br>Next, I add the 5 to that result: 5 + 8 = 13<br><br>So, the answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a student in grade 6 who knows nothing about order of operations, I might solve this simply from left to right as I would read a sentence. So, I might think first I have to add 5 and 2, which gives me 7, and then multiply that by 4. Doing it that way would give me 28. <br><br>However, if I stumbled upon the correct way to do it by chance or if someone told me the rule that multiplication comes before addition, then I'd do the multiplication first. So that would be 2 times 4, which is 8, and then add the 5 to get 13. <br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, so you want me to solve 7 times 2 plus 8 times 5?

So, 22 times 5... umm, I’m not really sure, but I can count by fives! So that's like:<br><br>5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105, 110.

      <td>GPT Response: When we have a math problem with different operations like multiplication and addition, we do the multiplication first. So first, we'll multiply 7 by 2 and then 8 by 5.
