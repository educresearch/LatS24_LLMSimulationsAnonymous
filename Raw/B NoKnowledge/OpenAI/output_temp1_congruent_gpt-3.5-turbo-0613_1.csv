systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: First, I need to do the calculation inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5 = 7.

Next, I multiply 4 by the result inside the parentheses, so 4 * 7 = 28.

Then, I add 12 to the previous result, which is 28 + 12 = 40.

After that, I multiply 2 by 3, which is 2 * 3 = 6.

Lastly, I subtract the result of the multiplication from the previous result, so 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34."
