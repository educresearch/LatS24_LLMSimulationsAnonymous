gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, I will solve the parentheses: (2+5) = 7

Next, I will perform the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28

Then, I will perform the multiplication: 2 * 3 = 6

Now, I will perform the addition: 28 + 12 = 40

Finally, I will perform the subtraction: 40 - 6 = 34

So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will use the order of operations. The order of operations is a rule that tells us how to solve problems step by step.

First, I will solve what is inside the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5 which equals 7. So, 4 * 7 is equal to 28.

Next, I will multiply and divide from left to right. There is no division here, so I will move on to multiplication. We have 4 * 7 which equals 28.

Now, I will add and subtract from left to right. We have 28 + 12 - 2 * 3. First, I will do the multiplication. 2 * 3 equals 6. So, our problem is now 28 + 12 - 6.

Finally, I will do the addition and subtraction. 28 + 12 equals 40. Then, I will subtract 6 from 40. 40 - 6 equals 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we need to solve what's inside the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, there is 2+5 which equals 7. 

Then, we can multiply 4 by 7, which gives us 28. 

Next, we solve the multiplication of 2*3, which equals 6. 

After that, we add 12 and subtract 6 from 28. 

So, the final answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will start by adding 2 and 5, which equals 7. Then, I multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. Next, I subtract 2 times 3, which equals 6. Finally, I add 12 and 6, which equals 18. 
          Therefore, the answer is 18."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to remember the order of operations. First, I will multiply 4 by 3, which equals 12. Then, I will add 2 to 12, which equals 14. So, the final answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve 4*3+2, we first multiply 4 by 3, which gives us 12. Then, we add 2 to 12, which gives us our final answer. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Hmm, when solving this problem, I think I should start by multiplying 4 and 3 because that is the first operation in the question. So 4 times 3 is 12. Then I should add 2 to the result. So 12 plus 2 is 14. So the answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I should start by multiplying 4 and 3, which equals 12.

gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to remember the order of operations. First, I will multiply 2 and 4, which equals 8. Then, I will add 5 to 8. 

So, the answer is 13.","GPT Response: To solve 5+2*4, I can start by only doing the multiplication first. Since there is no parentheses or exponents, I'll go straight to multiplication. 2 multiplied by 4 equals 8. Now, I can add 5 to 8. 5 plus 8 equals 13. So, the final answer is 13. 
The answer is 13.","GPT Response: Hmm, when solving this problem, I think I should start by adding 5 and 2 first because that's the first part. So, 5 plus 2 is 7. Then, I should multiply the result by 4 because that's the second part. So, 7 times 4 is 28. 
So, the answer is 28.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I should start by adding 5 and 2 together, which equals 7. Then, I multiply 7 by 4, which equals 28.
