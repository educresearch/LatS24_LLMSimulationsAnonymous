gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations which is parentheses, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).

First, we solve what's inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.

Next, we perform the multiplication and division operations: 4 * 7 = 28.

Then, we solve the addition and subtraction: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.
Multiplication comes before addition and subtraction, so we solve 2 * 3 first: 2 * 3 = 6.

Now we can perform the addition and subtraction: 28 + 12 - 6 = 34.

Therefore, the final answer is 34."

gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to follow the order of operations. First, I should do the multiplication between 4 and 3, which equals 12. Then, I add 2 to the result, which gives me 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will use the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS. According to PEMDAS, we should calculate anything inside parentheses first, then any exponents, then multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally addition and subtraction (from left to right).

Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5, which equals 7. 

Next, we multiply 4 by the result of (2 + 5), which is 4 * 7 = 28.

Then, we have 12 and we subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which is 2 * 3 = 6. 
So, 12 - 6 = 6.

Lastly, we add 28 and 6, which equals 28 + 6 = 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34."

gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Hmm, let's see. So we have 7 multiplied by 2, and then we add that to 8 multiplied by 5. Well, I think I'll start by multiplying 7 and 2, and then I'll multiply 8 and 5. After that, I'll add the two products together. So, 7 multiplied by 2 is 14, and 8 multiplied by 5 is 40. Now I just need to add 14 and 40.
