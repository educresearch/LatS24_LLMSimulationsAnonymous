      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to remember the order of operations. This means I first need to solve anything inside parentheses. There is 2+5 inside parentheses, so I add them together to get 7. <br><br>The expression becomes: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I need to multiply and divide from left to right. The first multiplication I need to do is 4 * 7, which equals 28. <br><br>The expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Now, I need to subtract. So I subtract 2 * 3, which equals 6. <br><br>The expression becomes: 28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Finally, I add the remaining numbers together. 28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 6 equals 34. <br><br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which tells us the order in which to perform calculations. The order of operations is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). <br><br>First, we start with the calculations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.<br><br>Then, we multiply 4 by the result of the parentheses: 4 * 7 = 28.<br><br>Next, we have 12 - 2 * 3. Multiplication comes before subtraction, so we multiply 2 by 3: 2 * 3 = 6.<br><br>Finally, we perform the subtraction: 12 - 6 = 6.<br><br>So the final answer is 6 + 28 = 34.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we do the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we have 2+5 which is equal to 7. So now, the equation becomes 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. <br><br>Next, we do the multiplication. 4 * 7 is equal to 28 and 2 * 3 is equal to 6. So our equation now becomes 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Lastly, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right. 28 + 12 is equal to 40 and 40 - 6 is equal to 34.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I'll solve the operations inside the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, there is 2 + 5, which gives us 7. <br><br>Next, I'll solve the multiplication and division from left to right. First, I have 4 multiplied by 7, which gives us 28. <br><br>Then, I have 2 multiplied by 3, which gives us 6. <br><br>Now, I'll solve the addition and subtraction from left to right. First, I have 28 + 12, which gives us 40. <br><br>Finally, I have 40 - 6, which gives us 34. <br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
