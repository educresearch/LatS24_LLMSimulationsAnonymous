gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Oh, I remember my teacher talking about this! She said that when you see a bunch of numbers and symbols like this, you have to do them in a special order so that everyone gets the same answer. It's like a math rule. She used a word that sounded like a ladder or something... Oh, yeah, ""order of operations!""

So, the first thing you do is parentheses - that's like doing the math inside the hugs first because they're really important. Then, you do any exponents - those are the little numbers that float in the air, but there aren't any here. After that, you have to do multiplication or division, whichever comes first when you look from left to right. And lastly, you do addition or subtraction, also from left to right.

For this problem, I'll start with the parentheses: 2 plus 5 is 7.
Next, I multiply because that comes before addition and subtraction. So I'll do 4 times 7, and that's 28. And I see another multiplication, 2 times 3 is 6.
Now, I just add and subtract everything in order, from left to right! 

So, it's 28 (from the 4 times 7) plus 12, which is 40.
And then from 40, I subtract 6 (from the 2 times 3), so that leaves me with 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Oh, I learned this recently! We have to follow the order of operations that our teacher told us about. It's like a rule to know which part of a math problem to solve first. The order goes Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (also from left to right). There's this acronym PEMDAS to help us remember. Sometimes people say ""Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally"" to make it easier to remember.

So first, we look for parentheses. We do the math inside those first.

In this problem we have (2+5). Adding those together we get 7.

So now our problem looks like this: 4*7 + 12 - 2*3

Next, we don't have any exponents to worry about, so let's move on to multiplication and division.

We have two multiplication parts: 4*7 and 2*3. So let's solve those:

4*7 is 28
2*3 is 6

Now we replace those in our problem and it looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

Lastly, we do addition and subtraction, from left to right. We just add 28 and 12 first, and then subtract 6:

28 + 12 is 40
40 - 6 is 34

So, the final answer is 34. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Oh, so I think I just have to do what's in the brackets first because that's like a little math problem inside the bigger one. So 2 plus 5 is 7. Then I multiply 4 by 7 because multiplication is like adding something many times. 4 times 7 is 28.

So now I have 28 plus 12 minus, um, oh I have to multiply again right? 2 times 3 is 6. So now it's 28 plus 12 minus 6.

Then I add 28 and 12 together since that's just like counting up more, and that gives me 40. Lastly, I take away 6 from 40 because minus is like giving away some of what you have. 40 minus 6 is 34.

So the answer is 34.","GPT Response: Okay, so I'm not quite sure about the fancy rules, but I think you do stuff in the parentheses first because it's like doing the inside of a present before you wrap it up. So in the parentheses, 2 plus 5 is 7. Then you've got 4 times that, and 4 times 7 is 28! 

Next, we have the plus 12 part, and since I'm really good at adding, that's easy: 28 plus 12 is 40. 

Now, there's this minus thingy and some more multiplying. Minus is like taking away, so we'll do that after, because the multiplication is like making more of something and you probably do that before you start taking it away. So, 2 times 3 is 6.

Last, we take that 40 we had and take away the 6, which means we end up with 34 because 40 minus 6 is 34.

So, the answer is 34."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I might just solve it from left to right because that's how we read.

So I'd do 4 times 3 first because that's the first thing I see, and that gives me 12. Then I'd add 2 to that because it's the next thing in the question. 

12 plus 2 equals 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Okay, if I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations, I might just solve this from left to right as I read it. So I would multiply 4 and 3 first, because that's the first operation I see. That gives me 12.

Then I would add 2 to that result. So, 12 plus 2 equals 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Oh, this looks like one of the math problems we do in class! I think you just go from left to right, like reading a book. So first, I'll do 4 times 3 which is 12, and then I just need to add 2. So that's easy, 12 plus 2 is 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Since I'm an elementary school student and don't know about the order of operations yet, I might just solve it from left to right like this:

First, multiply 4 times 3, which is 12.

So I think the answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I might just solve it from left to right because that's how we read. So I would think:

First, I add 5 + 2 which is 7.
Then, I multiply that by 4 so 7 * 4 is 28.

So, I would say the answer is 28, even though that's not using the correct order of operations. If I learned the right way, which is PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right), I would have to do the multiplication before the addition. But since I don't know that yet, I'm just going with 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Okay, if I'm not yet familiar with the order of operations, I might just solve this from left to right as I read it. So I would first do the addition:

5 + 2 = 7

Then, I would multiply this by 4:

7 * 4 = 28

However, I think my teacher mentioned something about doing multiplication before addition. If that's the case, it would be like this instead:

First, I would do the multiplication part:

2 * 4 = 8

And then add that to 5:

5 + 8 = 13

So even though I did it the first way, I think the correct way taking into account that multiplication comes before addition would give me 13.

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: Oh, this looks like a fun puzzle with numbers! I like to just add and multiply numbers in the order I see them. So, if I see 5 plus 2, that makes 7, right? And then it says to multiply by 4, so I'll take the 7 and multiply it by 4. Seven times four is, um... 28! 

So, the answer is 28.","GPT Response: Since I'm an elementary school student and don't know about the order of operations yet, I might just solve it from left to right like this:

gpt-4-1106-preview,1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Oh wow, this looks tricky. I think I remember my teacher talking about how to solve these types of problems. We need to do something with the multiplication first before we add. Let's see... first we multiply 7 by 2, which is 14. Then, we multiply 8 by 5, which is 40. Now, we just add those two together!

So, 14 (from 7 times 2) plus 40 (from 8 times 5) equals 54.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: I just learned about this! Okay, so to solve this problem, I need to remember what my teacher told me about the order of operations. There's this thing called PEMDAS, which stands for:

- Parentheses
- Exponents
- Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
- Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Since there are no parentheses or exponents in this problem, I will start with multiplication and then addition.

So I'll do the multiplication parts first:

7 times 2 equals 14.
8 times 5 equals 40.

Now I will add those results together:

14 plus 40 equals 54.

So, the answer is 54.","GPT Response: Okay, so if I don't know about the order of operations, I might just solve this from left to right like I read a book. So first I'll do 7 times 2 which is 14, and then I'll just keep going and do 14 plus 8 which is 22, and last I'll do 22 times 5. So that's like counting by 22 five times: 22, 44, 66, 88, 110.

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: Oops, I haven't learned about the special rules for the order you're supposed to do operations in math class yet, but I can still try to solve it step by step.

First, I'll do the multiplications because that's like a bunch of adding, and it seems like it should go first.

So, 7 times 2 is 14, because 7 plus 7 equals 14.

Then 8 times 5 is 40, because if I count by fives - 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 - it takes eight times to get to 40.

Now I just add those two results together: 14 plus 40.

Well, 10 plus 40 is 50, and then I add the 4 and get 54.

So, doing the multiplications first and then the addition, I think the answer is 54. The answer is 54."
