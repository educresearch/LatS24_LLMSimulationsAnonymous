      <td>GPT Response: First, I solve the numbers inside the parentheses. So, 2 + 5 = 7. Then, I multiply 4 and 7, which equals 28. After that, I subtract 2 from 12, which equals 10. Then, I multiply 2 and 3, which equals 6. Lastly, I add 28 and 10, which equals 38. Then, I subtract 6 from 38, which equals 32. <br>The answer is 32.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I would just solve it from left to right. First, I would do 4 * (2+5), which is 28. Then I would add 12 to get 40. Then I would subtract 2 * 3, which is 6. So the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I just do the operations from left to right. So first I add 2 and 5 to get 7. Then I do 4 times 7 to get 28. After that, I add 12 to get 40. Finally, I do 2 times 3 to get 6. Then I subtract 6 from 40 to get the final answer. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: First, I do what's on the left side, which is 4*3. That's 12. Then I bring down the plus sign and the 2. So, it's 12+2. And that's 14. <br>The answer is 14.</td>
