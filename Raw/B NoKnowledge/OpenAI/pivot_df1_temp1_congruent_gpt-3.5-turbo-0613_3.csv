gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations.
First, we do anything inside parentheses. In this case, 2 + 5 equals 7.
The expression now becomes 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.
Next, we multiply and divide from left to right. 4 * 7 equals 28.
The expression now becomes 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.
Then, we do any addition and subtraction from left to right. 28 + 12 equals 40.
The expression now becomes 40 - 2 * 3.
Finally, we do the remaining multiplication. 2 * 3 equals 6.
The expression now becomes 40 - 6.
