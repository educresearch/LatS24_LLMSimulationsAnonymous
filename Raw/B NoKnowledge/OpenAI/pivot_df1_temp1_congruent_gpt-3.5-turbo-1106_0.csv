gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Um, I think you just do the operations from left to right, so it would be 5 + 8, which is 13. So the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Um, I think I just need to do the math from left to right. So, 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40. So the final answer is 14 plus 40, which is 54.

The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,GPT Response: I don't know how to solve this problem.
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses: 4*(7) + 12 - 2*3
Then, we do the multiplication: 28 + 12 - 6
Finally, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 40 - 6
The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,GPT Response: I don't know how to solve this problem.
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: First, you have to do the multiplication before the addition. So 2 multiplied by 4 is 8. Then you add 5 to it.

The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: First, I just multiply each pair of numbers. So 7 multiplied by 2 gives 14, and 8 multiplied by 5 gives 40. Then, I just add those two numbers together. So, 14 plus 40 gives 54. 

The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, I'll do the operation inside the parentheses. 4 times 3 is 12. Then I add 2 to 12, which gives me 14. So the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, I will solve the parentheses. 2 + 5 equals 7. Then, I will solve the multiplication. 4 * 7 equals 28 and 2 * 3 equals 6. After that, I will do the addition and subtraction in order from left to right. 28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 6 equals 34. 
So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: First, you have to do the multiplication before the addition. So 3 multiplied by 2 is 6. Then you add 5 to it.

The answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Umm, I think you just do the operations from left to right, so it would be 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: So first you do the multiplication from left to right. 7*2 is 14 and 8*5 is 40. Then you add the results together. 

The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Umm, I think you just multiply 4 by 3 first, and then add 2 at the end. So, it's like 12 + 2. The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: I add 2 and 5 first because they are next to each other. Then I multiply that answer by 4, and add 12. After that, I subtract 2 times 3. 

The answer is 36."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Umm, I think you just do the operations from left to right, so it would be 5 + 3 equals 8, and then times 2, which is 16. So, the answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: First, I just do the operations from left to right. So, 5 + 2 equals 7 then 7 times 4 equals 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: First, I just need to do the math from left to right. So, 7 times 2 is 14. Then, 8 times 5 is 40. So, I add 14 and 40, and I get 54. The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, I just do the operations from left to right. So, 4*3 is 12, then I add 2 to get 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, I add the numbers inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.
Then, I multiply 4 by 7: 4 * 7 = 28.
After that, I multiply 2 by 3: 2 * 3 = 6.
Finally, I add or subtract the numbers in the order they appear: 28 + 12 - 6 = 34.
So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: First, I just do the operations from left to right. So, 5 + 3 equals 8 then 8 * 2 equals 16. 

The answer is 16."
