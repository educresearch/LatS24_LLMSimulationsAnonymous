      <td>GPT Response: First, we need to calculate the numbers inside the parentheses. 2 + 5 equals 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. Next, 2 multiplied by 3 equals 6. After that, we add 12 to 28, which gives us 40. Finally, we subtract 6 from 40, and the final answer is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I'll do what's in the parentheses, so 2 + 5 equals 7. Then, I'll do the multiplication first, so 4 * 7 equals 28, and 2 * 3 equals 6. Lastly, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right, so 28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 6 equals 34. <br>The answer is 34.</td>
