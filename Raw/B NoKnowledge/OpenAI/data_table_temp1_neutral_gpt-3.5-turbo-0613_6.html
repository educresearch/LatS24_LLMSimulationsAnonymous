      <td>GPT Response: When solving this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. We start by adding 2 and 5, which gives us 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. Next, we add 12 to 28, which gives us 40. Finally, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which equals 6, from 40. <br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will follow the order of operations (PEMDAS) which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). <br><br>First, I will solve the expression inside the parentheses, which is 2+5. This equals 7. <br><br>Next, I will multiply 4 by the result of the expression inside the parentheses, which is 4*7. This equals 28. <br><br>Then, I will multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. <br><br>After that, I will subtract 6 from 12, which equals 6. <br><br>Lastly, I will add the results of the multiplication and subtraction, which is 28+6. This equals 34. <br><br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we should follow the order of operations.<br><br>First, we start with the parentheses. In this case, we have (2+5), which equals 7.<br><br>Next, we do the multiplication and division from left to right. So, we have 4 * 7, which equals 28.<br><br>Then, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So, we have 28 + 12, which equals 40.<br><br>Finally, we have 40 - 2 * 3. We should start with the multiplication, so we have 2 * 3, which equals 6. Then we have 40 - 6, which equals 34.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to do the operations in the order they appear. First, I see there are parentheses, so I need to add what's inside them first, which is 2 + 5 = 7. Then, I multiply 4 by 7, which gives me 28. Next, I have to add 12 to 28, which gives me 40. Finally, I subtract 2 times 3, which is 6, from 40. So the answer is 34.</td>
