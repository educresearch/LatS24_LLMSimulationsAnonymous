gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, you do what's inside the parentheses. So, 2 + 5 equals 7. Then you do the multiplication first before the addition and subtraction. So, 4 * 7 equals 28 and 2 * 3 equals 6. Lastly, you do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So, 28 + 12 equals 40 and 40 - 6 equals 34. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication inside the parentheses. 4 times (2+5) is 28. Then, we have 28 + 12 - 2*3. Next, we do the multiplication, so 2*3 is 6. So, we have 28 + 12 - 6. Finally, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right, so 28 + 12 is 40, and 40 - 6 is 34. 
The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication inside the parentheses: 4*(2 + 5) equals 4*7. Then, you multiply 4*7 which equals 28. Then, you add 28 + 12, which equals 40. After that, you subtract 40 - 2*3. Then, you do the multiplication 2*3 which equals 6. Finally, you subtract 40 - 6. The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we do what's inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5. That equals 7. Then we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. After that, we add 12 to 28, which equals 40. Then we subtract 2 times 3, which is 6, from 40, and that equals 34.
So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4*3 + 2,GPT Response: I don't know how to solve this problem.,"GPT Response: First, we need to do the multiplication (4*3 = 12). Then we add 2 to the result (12 + 2 = 14). Therefore, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, you have to do the multiplication first, so it's 4 times 3 which equals 12. Then you just add 2 to 12, so the answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, I will do the multiplication, so 4*3 = 12. Then, I will add 2 to that, which gives me 14. 
So the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5 + 2*4,GPT Response: I don't know how to solve this problem.,"GPT Response: First, I need to do the multiplication (2*4) which equals 8. Then I add 5 to 8. 
The answer is 13.","GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication, so 2*4 is 8. Then you add 5, so the answer is 13.","GPT Response: First, I will do the multiplication, so 2*4 equals 8. Then, I will add 5 to 8 and get the final answer. 
The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5 + 3*2,GPT Response: I don't know how to solve this problem.,"GPT Response: First, I need to do the multiplication (3*2 = 6). Then I add the result to 5 (5 + 6 = 11). 

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: First, you have to do the multiplication. So, you do 3*2 which is 6. Then, you just add 5 to 6. The answer is 11.","GPT Response: First, I add 5 and 3, which equals 8. Then I multiply 8 by 2 and get 16. So the answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Um, I think I just need to do the multiplication first, then the addition. So, 7*2 is 14 and 8*5 is 40. Then I add 14 and 40, which is 54. So, the answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, I will multiply 7 and 2, which equals 14. Then, I will multiply 8 and 5, which equals 40. Lastly, I will add 14 and 40 together, which equals 54.  The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Um, I think I just need to do the multiplication first and then, um, add the products together. So, like, 7*2 is 14 and 8*5 is 40. So, um, I add 14 and 40 together and, uh, the answer is 54. So, like, the answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, we just do the multiplication from left to right. 7*2 = 14, and 8*5 = 40. Then we add those two results together. 

The answer is 54."
