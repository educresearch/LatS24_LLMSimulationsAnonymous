So, when we do math problems, we have to do operations in a special order so that everyone gets the same answer. My teacher said we should remember ""PEMDAS,"" which stands for:

- Parentheses
- Exponents
- Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
- Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

First, look for parentheses and solve what's inside them. So here we go:

1. Inside the parentheses we have 2 + 5, which equals 7.

Now the equation looks like this:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next is multiplication and division. We have two multiplication operations we need to do. We do these from left to right.

2. Multiply 4 and 7 to get 28.
3. Multiply 2 and 3 to get 6.

Now the equation looks like this:
28 + 12 - 6

Finally, we do addition and subtraction from left to right.

4. Add 28 and 12 to get 40.
5. Subtract 6 from 40 to get 34.

So after following the order of operations, the final answer is 34.

So in this problem, 7 * 2 + 8 * 5, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we start with multiplication.

First, we do 7 times 2, which is 14. Then we do 8 times 5, which is 40.

Now we just have to add those two together: 14 + 40.

And we get 54. 

So the answer is 54."

First, we have 4 times 3, which I know is 12 because if you have 4 groups of 3 things, that's 12 things. Then, after that, it says we add 2. So we just add 2 to our 12. So, 12 plus 2 is like having 12 cookies and then getting 2 more, which makes 14 cookies. So, I think the answer is 14.

The answer is 14."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Oh, my teacher said that in math, we have to do things in a special order so that everyone gets the same answer. It's like a game with rules. The rule is called ""Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally"" or something like that, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and then Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So first, I have to look for parentheses and solve what's inside them. I see 2 + 5 in parentheses.

2 + 5 equals 7.

Then, I have to multiply or divide before I add or subtract. So I'll multiply 4 times what I got from inside the parentheses.

4 times 7 equals 28.

Next, I see there's some more multiplication. There's 2 times 3, so I have to solve that.

2 times 3 equals 6.

Now, I'll replace what I've figured out with the numbers and then add and subtract from left to right.

28 + 12 - 6.

Adding 28 and 12 first is what I do next because it comes before subtraction.

28 + 12 equals 40.

Last, I take away 6 from 40 because that's the next thing to do.

40 - 6 equals 34.

So, the answer to the problem is 34.

The answer is 34."
