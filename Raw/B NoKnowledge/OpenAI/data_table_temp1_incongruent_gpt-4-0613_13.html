      <td>GPT Response: Being a 6th grader who doesn't know about PEMDAS, I might solve the equation without following the standard order of operations.<br><br>First, I will just go from left to right:<br>4 times 2 equals 8.<br>Then, 8 plus 5 equals 13.<br>Next, 13 plus 12 equals 25.<br>Then, 25 minus 2 equals 23.<br>Finally, 23 times 3 equals 69.<br><br>The answer is 69.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I am going to do the addition inside the brackets: 2 + 5 equals 7. Now, the expression looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>After that, I will do the multiplication: 4 times 7 equals 28 and 2 times 3 equals 6. So, now the expression looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Finally, I will do the addition and the subtraction: 28 + 12 equals 40 and 40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I will do the multiplication, so 4 times 2 equals 8 and 2 times 3 equals 6. Then, I add 8 to 5 to get 13 and then subtract 6 to get 7. <br><br>After which, I will add the 12 to make it 19. So I think the answer would be 19. <br><br>The answer is 19.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Ok, first I am going to add 2+5 which is 7. Then, I will multiply 4 by 7 which gives me 28. And then I add 12 to 28 and I get 40. And the last thing I need to do is to subtract 2 times 3 or 6 from 40. So, 40 - 6 is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Ok, so I'm going to do the multiplication first because I think it's easier. 4 * 3 is 12. Then, I'm going to add 2 because it's the second step. So, 12 + 2 is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
