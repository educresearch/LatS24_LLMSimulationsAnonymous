      <td>GPT Response: Oh, this looks like a puzzle with numbers! I think we should do the math in the part with the parentheses first because it's like when you do what's inside a gift box before dealing with the wrapping paper.<br><br>So, inside the parentheses we have 2 + 5. That's like two apples plus five apples. Easy peasy, that gives us 7 apples, I mean 7.<br><br>Now our math problem looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, I think we should do the multiplication because it's like if you have 4 bags with 7 marbles in each, you want to know how many marbles you have before you add or take any away. So 4 times 7 is like four groups of 7. Using my fingers, 7 plus 7 is 14, another 7 is 21, and one more is 28. Cool!<br><br>Now it looks like: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Let's do the other multiplication, with 2 * 3. That's like having 2 cookies, and if you get 3 times more, you'd have 6 cookies. Yum!<br><br>Now we have: 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Then we add 28 and 12 together because it's like having 28 stickers and getting 12 more. If you count them all up, you get 40 stickers.<br><br>So now it's: 40 - 6.<br><br>Last step! If you have 40 candies and you have to give away 6, you'd be left with 34 candies.<br><br>So, after all of that, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, since I'm in grade 6 and just learning about order of operations, let's break it down:<br><br>We have to follow the order of operations which is also known as PEMDAS:<br><br>P - Parentheses first<br>E - Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)<br>MD- Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)<br>AS - Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)<br><br>Let's solve the problem step by step:<br><br>1. First, we solve the parentheses (2+5):<br>4 * (7) + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>2. Then, we do the multiplication:<br>4 * 7 = 28<br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>So, we replace the multiplications with their results:<br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>3. Now, we do the addition and the subtraction from left to right:<br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>Then, subtract 6:<br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>4. There are no exponents, so we don't need to worry about that step.<br><br>So the final answer to the expression is:<br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Umm, since I don't know about order of operations, I might just solve it from left to right like reading a book. So I'm going to do each part in the order I see it.<br><br>First, I see 4 * (2+5), but the numbers are in these little curve things, I think maybe I just ignore them for now? So I'll just do 4 times 2 which is 8, and then add 5 to it because that's next. So that's 8 plus 5 which is 13.<br><br>Next, I see I have to add 12 to that, so 13 plus 12 is 25.<br><br>Then, I subtract 2 because it comes next in line, so 25 minus 2 is 23.<br><br>Finally, there is * 3 at the end. So I'm going to multiply 23 by 3. And 23 times 3 is... let's see... 69.<br><br>So if I just solve it as things come up, without knowing the special rules, I think the answer is 69.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: So, to solve this, I will first do the part inside the brackets because my teacher said that's like opening a surprise egg first. Inside the brackets is 2 + 5 which is easy, it's 7.<br><br>Now the problem looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, my teacher mentioned that multiplying is like having lots of groups of something, so I will do that next. 4 times 7 is like having 4 groups of 7 cookies, which gives me 28 cookies!<br><br>So now my problem is 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Now I have to do another multiplication. The 2 * 3 part is like having 2 packs of stickers, with 3 stickers in each pack, that's 6 stickers!<br><br>So what I have to solve now is 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Adding is like gathering stuff together. So if I have 28 marbles and I get 12 more, I now have 40 marbles.<br><br>Finally, subtracting is like giving some away. If I have 40 candies and give 6 away, I'm left with 34 candies.<br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, I'm not sure what the special rules are, but I think you do the multiplication part first and then add the number after. So first I would do 4 times 3, which is 12, and then I would add 2 to that. So 12 plus 2 is 14. <br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I haven't learned about order of operations yet, but I think I should do the multiplication first and then addition. So I'll do:<br><br>4 * 3 = 12<br><br>And then add 2:<br><br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure about special rules, but I think I should just solve it from left to right like I read a book! So first I'll do 4 times 3 which is 12, and then I add 2, which gives me 14. <br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I think I'm supposed to do the multiplication before I do the addition. So first, I do 4 times 3 which is 12. Then, I add the 2. So 12 plus 2 is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>5+2 * 4</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, I'm not really sure about special rules for doing math problems, but I think I would just do this from left to right like I read a book. So first, I would take the 5 and add 2, which gives me 7, and then I think I multiply that by 4. So 7 times 4 is 28.<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I remember my teacher said that when there are different operations like addition and multiplication in the same math problem, I need to do the multiplication part before the addition part. This is kind of like a rule to follow so we don't get confused.<br><br>So first, I'll do the multiplication part which is:<br><br>2 * 4 = 8<br><br>Then, I'll add that result to 5:<br><br>5 + 8 = 13<br><br>So the final answer is 13. The answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: My teacher told me that when I see a math problem with different things to do like adding and multiplying, I need to do the multiplying part before adding. That's because of something they call "order of operations," which is like a rule to follow so we all get the same answer.<br><br>First, I'll do the multiplying part:<br>2 times 4, which is 2 * 4, equals 8.<br><br>Now, I have 5 plus that 8 from the multiplication. So I add 5 + 8 together.<br><br>That's easy. 5 plus 8 equals 13.<br><br>So, the final answer is 13.</td>

      <td>5+3 * 2</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations yet, I might just try to solve it from left to right, like I read a sentence. So I would first add 5 + 3, which equals 8. Then I would multiply that by 2, because that's the next thing in the line. So, 8 times 2 is 16. <br><br>The answer is 16.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I remember my teacher talking about how we do math problems like this. She said there's a special order we have to follow so that we all get the same answer. It's like when we play games, there are rules. For math problems, we use PEMDAS, which stands for:<br><br>P: Parentheses first<br>E: Exponents (like squares and square roots, etc.)<br>MD: Multiplication and Division (from left to right)<br>AS: Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)<br><br>So first, we look to see if there are any parentheses or exponents. There aren't any here, so we can move on to multiplication and division.<br><br>We do the multiplication part next because it comes before addition in our PEMDAS rule. So we should first multiply 3 by 2.<br><br>3 * 2 = 6<br><br>Now we take that answer and add it to 5.<br><br>5 + 6 = 11<br><br>So, following the rules, we get our final answer. The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure about special rules, but I think I should just solve it from left to right like I read a book! So first I'll add 5 + 3 which is 8, and then I multiply 8 by 2 and that gives me 16.<br><br>The answer is 16.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I think I just add all the numbers up because that's what I know how to do! So it would be like this:<br><br>First I add 5 plus 3 which is 8, and then I multiply that by 2. So it goes:<br><br>5 + 3 = 8<br>8 * 2 = 16<br><br>The answer is 16.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, since I don't know about the order of operations, I might think that I just need to solve this from left to right, like reading a book! So here's how I would do it:<br><br>First, I would multiply 7 by 2 because it's the first thing I see. That gives me 14.<br><br>Then, I see there's a plus sign and an 8, so I add 14 and 8 together, which is 22.<br><br>Last, I see there's another multiplication with 5, so I multiply 22 by 5.<br><br>22 times 5 is 110.<br><br>So I would say, The answer is 110.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not sure what this PEMDAS is all about, but I think I can still try to solve it step by step. I know we have to do multiplication before we do addition, so let's multiply first.<br><br>First, we multiply 7 by 2, which gives us 14, and then we multiply 8 by 5, which gives us 40.<br><br>Now we have:<br><br>14 + 40<br><br>Next, we add those two numbers together.<br><br>So, 14 + 40 equals 54.<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Um, okay, so I don't really know any special rules for this, but I can do adding and multiplying! So I'll just do this step by step like I read it, from left to right.<br><br>First, I see 7 times 2, which is 14. Then there's a plus, so I add 8, which makes 22. Oh, but there's another times, this time with 5. So I multiply 22 and 5 together. I can count by fives to do that! Let's do it:<br><br>5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105, 110.<br><br>Counting by fives twenty-two times gives me 110. <br><br>So the answer is 110.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: When I do math problems, my teacher says it's important to do the multiplication parts first before adding. So I'm going to do that.<br><br>First I'll multiply 7 times 2 which is 14. Then I'll multiply 8 times 5 which is 40.<br><br>After that, I'll add the two numbers together. So 14 and 40 make 54.<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
