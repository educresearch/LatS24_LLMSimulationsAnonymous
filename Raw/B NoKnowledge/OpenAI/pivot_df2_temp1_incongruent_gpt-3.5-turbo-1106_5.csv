gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Umm, is it just like solving from left to right? Okay, so I add 2 and 5 first to get 7. Then I do 4 times 7, which is 28. After that, I do 2 times 3, which is 6. Then I add 12 and subtract 6. So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7
Then, we multiply:
4 * 7 = 28
After that, we do the remaining operations from left to right:
28 + 12 - 2 * 3 
= 40 - 2 * 3
= 40 - 6
= 34
So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses. 2 + 5 is 7. Then, we do the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28. Next, we do the multiplication outside the parentheses: 2 * 3 = 6. Lastly, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 - 6 = 34. So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7 is 28. Next, we add 12 to 28, which is 40. Then we subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which is 6, from 40. So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4 * 3+2,GPT Response: I don't know how to solve that.,"GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication of 4 and 3, which is 12. Then you add 2 to 12, which is 14. 
The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, I will do the multiplication first, so it is 12 + 2. Then I add 12 and 2 to get 14. The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication, so 4 times 3 is 12. Then, we add 2 to 12. So, the answer is 14. The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5+2 * 4,GPT Response: I don't really know much about that... Maybe the answer is 28?,"GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication before the addition. So, 2 times 4 equals 8. Then, we add 5 to 8, which equals 13. So, the answer is 13.","GPT Response: Umm... I think I just need to do the math from left to right. So, 5 + 2 is 7, and then I multiply that by 4, which equals 28. So, the answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication, so 2 times 4 is 8. Then, we add 5 to 8. 
The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: I don't really know much about that thing. Maybe it's just adding 5 and 3 together, then times 2. So, it's 8 times 2. The answer is 16.","GPT Response: I don't know about the order of operations, so I'll just do the operations from left to right. First, I'll add 5 and 3, which is 8. Then, I'll multiply 8 by 2, which is 16. So, the answer is 16.","GPT Response: Umm... I think we just do it from left to right, so it would be 5 + 6, which is 11. 
The answer is 11.","GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication, so 3 times 2 is 6. Then, we add 5 to 6. 
The answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: First, we multiply 7 and 2 together to get 14. Then, we multiply 8 and 5 together to get 40. After that, we add 14 and 40 to get the final answer. 

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, I will just do the calculations from left to right. 

7 times 2 is 14
14 plus 8 is 22
22 times 5 is 110 

So the answer is 110.","GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication. So, 7 * 2 is 14 and 8 * 5 is 40. Then we add 14 and 40 together, which is 54.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, we do 7 times 2, which is 14. Then we add 8 times 5, which is 40. Then we add those two together, which is 54. 

So, the answer is 54."
