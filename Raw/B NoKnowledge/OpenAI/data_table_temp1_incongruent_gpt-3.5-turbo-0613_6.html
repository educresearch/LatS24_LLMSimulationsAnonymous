      <td>GPT Response: First, we need to solve what's inside the parentheses. We have 2+5 which equals 7. <br><br>Next, we perform the multiplication operation. We have 4 multiplied by 7 which equals 28. <br><br>Then, we do the multiplication operation again. We have 2 multiplied by 3 which equals 6. <br><br>After that, we perform the addition operation. We have 28 plus 12 which equals 40.<br><br>Finally, we perform the subtraction operation. We have 40 minus 6 which equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us which calculations to perform in what order.<br><br>According to the order of operations, we should first perform any calculations inside parentheses. In this case, there is only one set of parentheses, (2+5), which equals 7.<br><br>Next, we need to perform any multiplication or division from left to right. Looking at the expression, the multiplication 4 * 7 comes next, which equals 28.<br><br>After that, we perform any addition or subtraction from left to right. So, we have 28 + 12 - 2 * 3. Multiplying 2 by 3 gives us 6, and then we can add 28 and 12 to get 40. Lastly, we subtract 6 from 40 to get the final answer.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we need to simplify the brackets. Inside the brackets, we have 2+5 which equals 7. So, 4 * (2+5) becomes 4 * 7.<br><br>Next, we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. So, 4 * 7 = 28.<br><br>Then, we need to solve the multiplication of 2 * 3, which equals 6.<br><br>Now, we can add and subtract. We have 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Adding 28 and 12 gives us 40. So, 28 + 12 = 40.<br><br>Finally, we subtract 6 from 40. So, 40 - 6 = 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to follow the order of operations. First, I will work inside the parentheses: (2+5) is 7.<br>Then, I will multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28.<br>Next, I will perform the multiplication: 2 * 3 is 6.<br>Finally, I will subtract: 28 - 6 is 22.<br>Therefore, the answer is 22.</td>
