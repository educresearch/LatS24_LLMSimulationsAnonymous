      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. First, we do the calculations inside the parentheses. So, 2 + 5 equals 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7, which is 28. Next, we add 12 to 28, which gives us 40. After that, we multiply 2 by 3, which gives us 6. Finally, we subtract 6 from 40. <br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I can start by simplifying the parentheses first. Inside the parentheses, I add 2 and 5 together, which is 7. <br><br>So now the expression is 4*(7) + 12 - 2*3. <br><br>Next, I can multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. <br><br>Now the expression is 28 + 12 - 2*3. <br><br>Next, I multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. <br><br>Now the expression is 28 + 12 - 6. <br><br>Lastly, I can add 28 and 12, which equals 40. <br><br>Now the expression is 40 - 6. <br><br>Finally, I subtract 6 from 40, which equals 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to work through the equation step by step. First, we do what is inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7. So now, our equation is 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. <br><br>Next, we solve the multiplication parts of the equation. 4 * 7 equals 28, and 2 * 3 equals 6. So, now our equation is 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Finally, we add and subtract from left to right. 28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 6 equals 34. <br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I will add the numbers inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.<br>Then, I will multiply 4 by 7: 4 * 7 = 28.<br>Next, I will add 12: 28 + 12 = 40.<br>Then, I will multiply 2 by 3: 2 * 3 = 6.<br>Finally, I will subtract 6 from 40: 40 - 6 = 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
