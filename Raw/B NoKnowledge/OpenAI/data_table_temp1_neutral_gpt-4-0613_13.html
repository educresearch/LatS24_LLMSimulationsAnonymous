      <td>GPT Response: First, I'll solve everything from left to right because I do not know about the order of operations. So, first, I'll multiply 4 and 2, which gives me 8. Then I'll add 5 to that, making it 13. After that, I'll add 12 to it which makes it 25. Then I would subtract 2 from the 25, resulting in 23, and then I will finally multiply 23 by 3, giving me a total of 69.<br><br>The answer is 69.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, since I don't know PEMDAS, I'm just gonna solve from left to right, like reading a book.<br><br>First, I'll do 4 times 2, which is 8. And then I'll add that 8 to 5, which is 13. Then I'll add 12 to that, making it 25. Finally, I'll times 2 and 3 which makes 6. <br><br>So then, 25 minus 6 is 19. <br><br>The answer is 19.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I will add 2+5, which equals to 7. Then, I will multiply what I just got, 7, by 4. This results to 28. After that, I'll add 12 to that, making it 40. Finally, I'll times 2 and 3 which makes 6. Then I'll subtract 6 from 40. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I would add 2 and 5 to get 7. Then, I would multiply that by 4 to get 28. After that, I would add 12 to get 40. Finally, I would subtract 2 times 3, or 6, to get 34. So, I think the answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would solve this problem from left to right. That's how I've been reading and solving things so far, and also, nobody explicitly taught me to go a different route. So, first, I multiply 4 by 3 to get 12. Then I add 2 to this result, to get 14. So, based on my current understanding, <br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
