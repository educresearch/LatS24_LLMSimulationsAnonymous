gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations called PEMDAS. This stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we solve what's inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5 = 7.

Then, we perform the multiplication and division operations from left to right. Starting with 4 * 7 = 28.

Next, we have 12 - 2 * 3. Multiplying first, 2 * 3 = 6. Then subtracting, 12 - 6 = 6.

Finally, we have 28 + 6 = 34.

So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS). This means we first have to do the calculations inside the parentheses, then any multiplication or division from left to right, and finally any addition or subtraction from left to right.

First, let's solve what's inside the parentheses: (2+5) = 7.

Next, we can multiply: 4 * 7 = 28.

Now, let's tackle the rest of the operations: 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.

According to PEMDAS, we need to do multiplication first: 2 * 3 = 6.

Then, we can add the numbers: 28 + 12 = 40.

Finally, we can subtract: 40 - 6 = 34.

Therefore, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: Hmm, let me try to figure this out. First, I see there are some numbers in parentheses, so I have to do that part first. Inside the parentheses, there's a plus sign, which means I have to add 2 and 5. That gives me 7. Now I have 4 times 7.

Next, I see there's a multiplication sign, so I have to do the multiplication first. 4 times 7 is 28. Now I have 28 plus 12.

Finally, there's a subtraction and a multiplication left. I think I have to do the multiplication first. 2 times 3 is 6. Now I have 28 plus 12 minus 6.

Finally, I have to do the addition and subtraction. 28 plus 12 is 40, and then minus 6 is 34.

So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I solve the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.
Then I multiply 4 by 7: 4 * 7 = 28.
Next, I add 12: 28 + 12 = 40.
After that, I multiply 2 by 3: 2 * 3 = 6.
Finally, I subtract 6 from 40: 40 - 6 = 34.
Therefore, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, you need to follow the order of operations. First, you perform the multiplication, which gives you 12. Then, you add 2 to that, which gives you 14. 
The answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will follow the order of operations (PEMDAS) which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, I will multiply 4 and 3, which gives me 12. Then I will add 2 to 12. 

So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I would start by doing the multiplication first. So, 4 times 3 equals 12. Then, I would add 2 to that, which gives me a final answer of 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations tells us that we should multiply before we add. So, we start by multiplying 4 and 3, which gives us 12. Then, we add 2 to 12, which gives us 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: To solve the expression 5+2 * 4, I will start by multiplying 2 and 4, which gives me 8. Then, I will add 5 to the result. So, the answer is 13.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will follow the order of operations (PEMDAS) which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, I will multiply 2 and 4 because multiplication comes before addition. 2 multiplied by 4 is 8. 

Then, I will add 5 to the result of the multiplication. 5 plus 8 equals 13.

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I would start by doing the multiplication first. So, 2 times 4 equals 8. Then, I would add 5 to 8 to get the final answer. So, the answer is 13.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I just follow the rule of doing the multiplication before the addition. So, I first multiply 2 and 4 which gives me 8. Then, I add 5 to 8.

First, I will multiply 3 and 2 because multiplication comes before addition. 3 * 2 equals 6. 

Then, I will add 5 and 6 because addition is the last operation. 5 + 6 equals 11.

So, the answer is 11.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I would start by doing the multiplication first. So, 3 times 2 equals 6. Then, I would add 5 to the result. So, the answer is 11.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I just follow the rule of doing the multiplication before the addition. So, I first multiply 3 and 2 which gives me 6.

gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: In this problem, you first need to multiply 7 by 2 which is 14. Then, you need to multiply 8 by 5 which is 40. Finally, you add the two results together which gives you 54. 
So, the answer is 54.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will just multiply the numbers from left to right without using any order of operations. So, first I will multiply 7 by 2 which is equal to 14. Then, I will multiply 8 by 5 which is equal to 40. Finally, I will add these two results together which gives me 54. 

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, I would solve the multiplication problem 7 * 2. The answer is 14. Then, I would solve the multiplication problem 8 * 5. The answer is 40. Finally, I would add the two answers together. So, the answer is 14 + 40. The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Um, so there's multiplication and addition in this problem. I don't know which one I should do first. Maybe I can just do them in the order they're written. Let's see, 7 times 2 is 14, and then I add 8 times 5 which is 40. So the answer is 14 plus 40 which is 54. 

The answer is 54."
