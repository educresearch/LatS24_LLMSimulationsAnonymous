      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, let's see. I'll just start from the left and do the operations as they come. First, I'll add 2 and 5 to get 7. Then I'll multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. After that, I'll subtract 2 from 12 to get 10. Finally, I'll multiply 2 by 3 to get 6. Now I'll just do 28 plus 10 minus 6. So, the answer is 32.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I don't know anything about the order of operations, but I'll just do the operations from left to right. <br><br>First, I'll calculate inside the parentheses: <br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Then I'll continue with the multiplication and addition in order: <br>4 * 7 = 28<br>28 + 12 = 40<br>40 - 2 = 38<br>38 * 3 = 114<br><br>So, the answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication inside the parentheses. So, 4*(2 + 5) becomes 4*7. Then, you do that multiplication, so 4*7 is 28. Next, you do the multiplication 2*3, which is 6. Now you can add and subtract from left to right, so 28 + 12 is 40, and 40 - 6 is 34. So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we need to do the operations inside the parentheses. So, 2 + 5 equals 7. Then, we have to multiply 4 by 7 which equals 28. After that, we add 12 to 28 which equals 40. Next, we subtract 2 times 3 which equals 6. Finally, we subtract 6 from 40 which equals 34. So, the answer is 34.</td>
