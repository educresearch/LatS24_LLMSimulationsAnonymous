gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Um, I don't really know anything about order of operations, but I'll just do the operations from left to right. So first, I'll do 4*(2 + 5), which is 4*7, so that's 28. Then I have + 12 - 2*3. So next, I'll do 2*3, which is 6. Then I have 28 + 12 - 6, which is 40 - 6. So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: Ok, so I start by looking at what's inside the parentheses first, so I add 2 and 5 to get 7. Then I would multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. After that, I add 12 to get 40. And finally, I subtract 2 times 3, which is 6. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses. 2 + 5 equals 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. Then, we do the other operations. 28 plus 12 equals 40. And 2 times 3 equals 6. Finally, we subtract 6 from 40, and the answer is 34. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses first. 2 + 5 equals 7. Then we do the multiplication: 4 * 7 equals 28. Then we do the multiplication of 2 * 3 which equals 6. After that, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So, 28 + 12 equals 40, and then 40 - 6 equals 34. 

So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4*3 + 2,GPT Response: I don't know what to do with this. Can you teach me?,"GPT Response: First, we just do the operations from left to right. 
So, 4*3 equals 12 and then we add 2, which equals 14.
The answer is 14.","GPT Response: I will just do the operations from left to right. So, 4*3 is 12, then plus 2 is 14. So the answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, I multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then I add 2 to 12 to get 14. So the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure, but I think I'll just do the operation from left to right. So, 5 + 2*4 equals 5 + 8, which is 13. 
The answer is 13.","GPT Response: First, we need to do the multiplication before the addition. So we do 2*4 which equals 8. Then we add 5 to 8 which equals 13. 
The answer is 13.","GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication, so 2*4 is 8. Then we add 5 to 8. So the answer is 13. Therefore, the answer is 13.","GPT Response: First, I add 5 and 2 together to get 7. Then I multiply 7 by 4 to get 28. So the final answer is 28.
The answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5 + 3*2,GPT Response: I don't know how to solve this problem using order of operations. Can you show me how to do it?,"GPT Response: First, we multiply 3 by 2 to get 6. Then, we add 5 to 6. So the answer is 11.  
The answer is 11.","GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication, so 3*2 is 6. Then you add 5 to the answer, so the answer is 11.","GPT Response: First, I add 5 and 3 together to get 8. Then I multiply 8 by 2 to get 16. 

The answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Umm, so I just do the operations from left to right, without worrying about any rules or anything. So, I'll first do 7*2 which is 14, then I'll do 8*5 which is 40. So the answer is 14 + 40, which is 54. 
So, the answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, you multiply 7 and 2 which equals 14. Then you multiply 8 and 5 which equals 40. After that, you just add 14 and 40 together, which equals 54. So the answer is 54.","GPT Response: Um, I think you just, um, do the operations in the order they appear. So, like, you do 7 times 2 first, and then you do 8 times 5. Um, so, the answer is 14 + 40, which is 54. Um, the answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, we do 7 times 2, which equals 14. Then, we do 8 times 5, which equals 40. Finally, we add those two numbers together, so 14 plus 40 equals 54. Therefore, the answer is 54."
