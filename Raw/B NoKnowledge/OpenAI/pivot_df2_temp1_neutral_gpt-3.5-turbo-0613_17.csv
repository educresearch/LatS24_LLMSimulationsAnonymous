gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to pay attention to the order of operations. I will start with the parentheses first. Inside the parentheses, 2 + 5 equals 7. 

Next, I will multiply 4 by 7, which gives me 28. 

Then, I will move on to the addition and subtraction. I will add 12 to 28, which gives me 40. Finally, I will subtract 2 times 3, which equals 6.

So, the final answer is 40 - 6, which equals 34. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to follow the order of operations known as PEMDAS. This stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, I will solve the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.

Now, I will multiply 4 by 7: 4 * 7 = 28.

Next, I will multiply 2 by 3: 2 * 3 = 6.

Then, I will add 12 to 28: 12 + 28 = 40.

Lastly, I will subtract 6 from 40: 40 - 6 = 34.

Therefore, the final answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, we can follow the order of operations. First, we look for any operations inside parentheses. In this case, we have 2 + 5, which equals 7. 
Then, we perform multiplication and division from left to right. We have 4 * 7, which equals 28. 
Next, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right. We have 28 + 12 - 2 * 3. 
Finally, we perform multiplication, which is 2 * 3, resulting in 6. 
Then, we perform addition from left to right, which is 28 + 12 - 6. 
Lastly, we perform subtraction from left to right, which is 40 - 6. 
The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I will perform the calculations inside the parentheses. 

2 + 5 = 7 

Next, I will multiply 4 by the sum of 2 and 5. 

4 * 7 = 28 

Then, I will multiply 2 by 3. 

2 * 3 = 6 

Lastly, I will subtract 6 from 12. 

12 - 6 = 6 

Therefore, the answer is 6."
