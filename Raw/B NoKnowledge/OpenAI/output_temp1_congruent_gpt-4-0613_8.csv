systemPrompt4_userPrompt5_modelgpt-4-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I used the ""order of operations"" in math. I learned that we should do multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. So I did the multiplication part first. 

3 times 2 is equal to 6. So, the problem became 5 + 6. 

After that, I added 5 and 6 together. 

The answer is 11."
