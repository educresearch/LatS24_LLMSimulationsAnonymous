gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Umm, I'm not sure about this, but I think you just do the operations from left to right. So, you do 5+2 first, which is 7, and then you multiply that by 4, which gives you 28. So, I think the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: I'm not sure about the order, but I remember my teacher saying something about BODMAS. I think I do the multiplication before addition. So, I'll first do 7 * 2 and 8 * 5, and then add the two results together. 

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Then add the two results: 14 + 40 = 54

So the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Umm, I'm not sure. Maybe I just have to do the multiplication first, then the addition? So, 4 * 3 is 12, and then I add 2 to get 14. So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Oh, this looks tricky. I think I just need to solve it from left to right. First, I do what's inside the parentheses - 2+5 is 7. Then, I do 4 times 7, which is 28. Then, I do 2 times 3, which is 6. Finally, I add and subtract everything from left to right. So, 28 plus 12 is 40, and 40 minus 6 is 34. 

The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Umm, I'm not sure. Maybe I just add the 5 and 3 together first? So, 5+3 equals 8. Then I guess I just multiply that by 2? So, 8 * 2 equals 16. 

The answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: First, I'll do the operation inside the parentheses. 2 times 4 is 8. Then, I'll add 5 to 8 which equals 13. 

The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: So, first I'll just do the operations from left to right. So, I'll do 7 * 2 which is 14. Then I'll do 8 * 5 which is 40. So, the final answer is 14 + 40 which is 54. 
The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: First, I do the multiplication which is 4*3 = 12. Then I add 2 to 12, which equals 14. 
The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, I will solve what is inside the parentheses. So I will do 2 + 5 which equals 7. Then I will multiply 4 by 7 which gives 28. After that, I need to subtract 2 multiplied by 3 from 28, which equals 22.

The answer is 22."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: I don't really know about order of operations, but I think I just do the operations from left to right. So, 5 + 3 is 8, then 8 * 2 is 16. 
The answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2 * 4,GPT Response: First I do 5 + 2 which is 7. And then I do 7 * 4 which is 28. So the answer is 28.
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Umm, I just solve it from left to right. So, 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40. Then I add them together, so the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Um, I think you just do the math from left to right. So, 4 times 3 is 12, then you add 2 to that. So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. After that, we multiply 2 by 3 to get 6. Finally, we add and subtract from left to right: 28 + 12 - 6 = 34. 

So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: First I do 5 plus 3, which is 8. Then I do 8 times 2, which is 16. So, the answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: So first, we do 5 + 2 which is 7. Then we have to multiply that by 4, so it's 7 * 4 which is 28. 
The answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: First, I multiply 7 by 2 which equals 14. Then, I multiply 8 by 5 which equals 40. Finally, I add 14 and 40 together, which equals 54. So, the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: So first, we do 4 times 3 which is 12. Then we add 2 to 12. So the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, you solve the numbers inside the parentheses. So, 2 + 5 equals 7. Then, you do the multiplication and division from left to right. 4 times 7 equals 28. Next, 2 times 3 equals 6. Finally, you do the addition and subtraction from left to right. 28 plus 12 equals 40, and 40 minus 6 equals 34. So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: So first, we do 5 + 3 which equals 8. Then we have to do 8 times 2 which equals 16. So the answer is 16."
