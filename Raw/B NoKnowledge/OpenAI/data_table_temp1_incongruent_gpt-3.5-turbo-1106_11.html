      <td>GPT Response: Umm, I'm not really sure how to do this, but I guess I'll just go from left to right. So, 4 times (2 plus 5) is 4 times 7, which is 28. Then, plus 12 is 40. Then minus 2 times 3 is 6. So, the answer is 40 minus 6, which is 34. So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I will do the operations inside the parentheses. 2+5 is 7. Then, I'll do the multiplication first before addition and subtraction. 4 * 7 is 28. -2 * 3 is -6. Then, I add 12 to 28 which gives 40, and then I subtract 6 from 40, which gives 34. <br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, you do the numbers inside the parentheses. 2+5 is 7. Then, you multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. After that, you do the multiplication 2 * 3, which is 6. Then you add 12 and subtract 6 from 28 to get the final answer, which is 34. So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we do the math inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7.<br><br>Then we perform the multiplication: 4 * 7 equals 28.<br><br>After that, we do the subtraction: 28 + 12 equals 40.<br><br>And finally, we do the last multiplication: 2 * 3 equals 6.<br><br>So, the answer is 34.</td>
