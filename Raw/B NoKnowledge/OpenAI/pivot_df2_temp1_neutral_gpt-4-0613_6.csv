gpt-4-0613,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: When I look at this problem, the first thing I want to do is start from the left and work to the right, it's like reading a book after all!

4*(2+5) - Here I add 2 and 5 together get 7, then multiply by 4 to get 28.
28 + 12 - Then I add 12 to that and get 40.
40 - 2 * 3 - Then I subtract 2 and multiply by 3 to get 114.

The answer is 114.","GPT Response: Hmm, I don't know about order of operations, so I will just solve it from left to right. 
First, 4 times 2 is 8.
Next, I'll add 5 to 8 and I get 13.
After this, I will add 13 to 12 which gives me 25.
Then I get 25 minus 2 which is 23. Final step, I will multiply 23 by 3 to get 69.
The answer is 69.","GPT Response: First, I will add 2 and 5, then I will multiply the answer by 4. This will give me 28.  Then I will add this to 12 to get 40. After that, I will subtract 2 and get 38, then I will multiply this by 3. This gives me 114.

The answer is 114.","GPT Response: First, I will add the 2 and 5 which gives 7. Then, I will multiply 4 by the resulting 7 to get 28. Then, I will add 12 to the 28 to get 40. After that, I will subtract 2 times 3 from 40. 2 times 3 equals 6, so I get 40 minus 6 which is 34. The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would just solve the problem from left to right as I see it. 

So it would look something like this: 

First, I would multiply 4 times 3 which equals 12.

Then I would add 2 to 12, which equals 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I would first do the multiplication part, and then the addition part. So, first I would multiply 4 and 3 to get 12, then I would add 2 to the 12 which equals 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would solve the problem in the order I read it. First, I would multiply 4 times 3 to get 12. Next, I would add 12 and 2 together to get 14. So, I think the answer is 14. The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, I would do 4 times 3, which equals 12. Then I would add 2 to the 12, which equals 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: First, I add 5+2 which equals 7. Then, I multiply 7*4, which gives me 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I would first do the addition part, and then the multiplication part. So, first I would sum up 5 and 2, which gives 7. After that, I will multiply 7 by 4, which gives 28. Hence, the answer to this problem according to my understanding is 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would solve the problem in the order I read it. First, I would add 5 + 2 to get 7, then I would multiply 7 * 4 to get 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, I just add numbers from left to right, like this: 5 plus 2 equals 7, then 7 times 4 equals 28.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: First, I add 5+3 which equals 8. Then, I multiply the result by 2 which gives me 16.

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: First, I will add the 5 and 3 which gives 8, then I will multiply the 8 by 2 which equals to 16. So, the answer is 16.","GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would solve the problem in the order I read it. First, I would add 5 + 3 to get 8. Then, I would multiply 8 * 2 to get 16.

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: First, I would add 5 and 3, which would give 8. Then, I would multiply 8 and 2 which would give 16.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would solve this problem from left to right as I read it. 

First, I would multiply 7*2, which gives me 14.

Then, I'd add that result to 8, getting 22.

Lastly, I'd multiply this result by 5, resulting in 110.

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: First, I'll do the multiplication part because I was told earlier that multiplication should be done before addition. So, I'll multiply 7 by 2 which gives 14 and then 8 by 5 which gives 40. After that, I'll add these two results together, which is 14 + 40 which equals 54.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Well, I don't know about any special rules, so I'll just solve the problem in the order I read it! First, I'll multiply 7 times 2 to get 14. Next, I'll add 8 to that 14 which gives me 22. Lastly, I'll multiply that 22 by 5, resulting in 110.

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: First, I will multiply 7 with 2 and I get 14. Then, I multiply 8 and 5 together and I get 40. Now, I will add these two results together: 14 plus 40 equals 54.

The answer is 54."
