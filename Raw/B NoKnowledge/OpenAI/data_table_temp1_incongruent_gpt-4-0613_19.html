      <td>GPT Response: Well, since I'm not familiar with the order of operations yet, I'll just solve the problem from left to right. I'll start with the multiplication and add all of the sums. <br><br>First, I'll do 4 * (2+5) which to me reads as "4 times 2 plus 5" which equals to 20 (8 +12). <br><br>Then, I'll add 12 to the result to get 32 (20+12).<br><br>After that, I'll subtract 2, which gives me 30 (32-2).<br><br>Finally, I'll multiply that by 3 and get the final result as 90.<br> <br>The answer is 90.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I see brackets in the problem so I will solve that first. Inside the brackets, we have 2+5, which adds up to 7. <br><br>After solving for the brackets, my new problem will look like this, 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. <br><br>Next, I'm going to do all the multiplications in the problem. We have 4 * 7 which equals 28, then, we have 2 * 3 which gives 6. My new equation will now look like this, 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Then, I will solve 28 plus 12 which gives 40. After doing that, my new problem will look like this 40 - 6.<br><br>Lastly, I will solve 40 minus 6 which equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I would add 2+5 to get 7. Then, 4 times 7 equals 28. Then I will add 12 to 28 to get 40. Then I will subtract 2 times 3 (which is 6) from 40. So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I'll add the numbers in the parentheses since that seems easy: 2+5 is 7.<br><br>Then, I'll multiply 4 by that result because multiplication is just repeated addition: 4*7 is 28.<br><br>Then, I'll do the addition: 28+12, which is 40.<br><br>Then, I'll do the subtraction: 40-2, and that is 38.<br><br>Lastly, I'll perform the multiplication of 3*2, which equals 6.<br><br>The answer is 6.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, as a 6th grader, I'm not sure about the order of operation but I will do the calculation in the order it is written. So, first I'm gonna take the numbers 4 and 3 and multiply them which will give me 12. Then, I will add 2 to 12 because that's what's next in the equation. So, that's 12+2 and this will give me 14.<br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I know from my elementary school math lessons that the basic arithmetic operations are, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. And I generally solve them from left to right. I will do the multiplication first and add the result to 2. Let's do it together:<br><br>Firstly, I will multiply 4 by 3, which gives me 12. Then, I will add that result to 2, which is 12 + 2 equals 14. So,<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, you would multiply 4 and 3 together because in math, it's important to multiply before you do any addition. That gives you the number 12. Then, you would add 2 to that number to get 14. The answer is 14.</td>
