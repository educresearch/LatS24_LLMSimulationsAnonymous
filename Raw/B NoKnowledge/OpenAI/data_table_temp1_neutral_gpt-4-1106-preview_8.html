      <td>GPT Response: Oh gosh, okay, I'm not really sure about all these brackets and stuff, but I think I have to do the things in the parentheses first. So if I look at the problem, I see:<br><br>4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>First, I'll add the 2 and the 5 together because they're inside the parentheses!<br><br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now it looks like:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Then I think I have to do the multiplication before the adding and subtracting, because my teacher mentioned that once. So I'll multiply 4 times 7 and then 2 times 3:<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br><br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>So now it's:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Now, I'll just add and subtract from left to right, because that's how you read a sentence!<br><br>First, add 28 and 12:<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>Then subtract 6 from 40:<br><br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So, the final answer... The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not sure what PEMDAS is, but I heard once from my older sister that you should do what's inside the parentheses first. So let's do that!<br><br>First, we handle the parentheses:<br>(2 + 5) equals 7.<br><br>Now the equation looks like this:<br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I think you do the multiplication before you do the addition or subtraction. So let's do the two multiplications:<br><br>4 * 7 equals 28.<br>2 * 3 equals 6.<br><br>Now we replace those in the equation and it looks like this:<br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Now, we just do the addition and subtraction from left to right, I guess:<br><br>28 + 12 equals 40.<br>40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>So the final answer is 34!<br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, since I don't know about order of operations yet, I would probably just do the math from left to right, like reading a book! So here's how it goes:<br><br>First I see 4 and then a star that usually means times, so I would say 4 times something, and then I see those curvy lines with 2+5 inside. I'm not sure what those mean but I think I should just add those first. So 2 plus 5 is 7.<br><br>Now, I have 4 times 7, which I think is 28. <br><br>Next, I see a plus sign and 12, so I would add 12 to 28 which is 40.<br><br>Then there's a minus sign and the number 2, so if I take 2 away from 40, I get 38.<br><br>And lastly, I see 2 starred by 3 again, so I multiply those and get 6.<br><br>Now I need to take away 6 from 38, and that leaves me with 32.<br><br>The answer is 32.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay! So first, I think we should do what's inside the parentheses because my teacher said that's like doing the 'please' in 'please excuse my dear Aunt Sally,' which stands for parentheses first!<br><br>So, inside the parentheses is 2 + 5, which adds up to 7.<br><br>Now the problem looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I think we should do the multiplication because that's like the 'excuse' and 'dear' in 'please excuse my dear Aunt Sally'. <br><br>So, 4 times 7 is 28. And 2 times 3 is 6.<br><br>Now our problem is: 28 + 12 - 6<br><br>Now we just need to add and subtract in the order we see them. So, 28 plus 12 is 40.<br><br>Finally 40 minus 6 is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I remember my teacher saying something about doing multiplying first before adding! So first, I'll do 4 times 3 which is 12. Then I'll take that 12 and add 2 to it. That would be 14!<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about order of operations yet, I might first add 5 and 2 together because they are next to each other, and then multiply the result by 4.<br><br>So it would look like:<br>First, I add 5 + 2 which equals 7.<br>Then, I multiply 7 by 4 which equals 28.<br><br>However, I know my teacher mentioned something about doing multiplying before adding. If I was to follow that, it would look like this:<br><br>First, I multiply 2 by 4 which equals 8.<br>Then, I add 5 to the 8, which equals 13.<br><br>This second way seems to be the way my teacher wanted us to do it. So:<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who hasn't learned about the order of operations yet, I might think I just need to solve this from left to right. So first, I would add 5 and 2 to get 7, and then I would multiply that by 4.<br><br>7 (from adding 5 and 2) times 4 equals 28.<br><br>So I would say the answer is 28. However, I should actually learn the correct order of operations, which is PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right). According to that, I need to do the multiplication before the addition.<br><br>First, 2 times 4 is 8. Then, I add that to 5 to get 13.<br><br>Using PEMDAS, the correct answer is 13. But since I don't know that yet, I might initially think the answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I learned that when you have numbers and plus signs and times signs, you can just do the math from left to right like reading a book! So first I'll add 5 plus 2 because that's the first part I see, and that makes 7. Then I'll multiply the 7 by 4 because that's the next part. So 7 times 4 is 28. <br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: When I do math problems, my teacher told me that I have to do multiplication before addition. So I will first multiply 2 times 4 which is 8. Then I add the 5. So 5 plus 8 equals 13!<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Since I haven't learned about the order of operations yet, I might mistakenly think that I should just calculate from left to right.

      <td>GPT Response: When you have addition and multiplication in the same math problem, you have to do the multiplication part first before you do the addition.
