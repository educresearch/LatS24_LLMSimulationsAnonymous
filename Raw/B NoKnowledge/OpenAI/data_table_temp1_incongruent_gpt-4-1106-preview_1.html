      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm a grade 6 student and I just learned about order of operations, which is PEMDAS:<br><br>P - Parentheses first<br>E - Exponents (I don't see any exponents here, so I can skip this step)<br>MD - Multiplication and Division (from left to right)<br>AS - Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)<br><br>Here's how I solve it step by step:<br><br>1. Solve the parentheses first:<br>   (2 + 5) = 7<br><br>2. Now, the equation looks like this:<br>   4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>3. Next, I do the multiplication:<br>   4 * 7 = 28<br>   2 * 3 = 6<br><br>   So now the equation is:<br>   28 + 12 - 6<br><br>4. Finally, I do the addition and subtraction from left to right:<br>   28 + 12 = 40<br>   40 - 6 = 34<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, since I'm in grade 6 and I don't know the order of operations, I might solve this step by step just like any basic math problem.<br><br>First, I see parentheses, and my teacher said we do what's in parentheses first. So I add:<br><br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now, I'll replace that part of the problem with 7:<br><br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Then, I'll just go from left to right since I don't know about the right order to solve this.<br><br>First, multiply 4 and 7:<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br><br>Now the problem looks like this:<br><br>28 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>Next, I add 28 and 12:<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>So now I have:<br><br>40 - 2 * 3<br><br>Then I subtract 2 from 40 because that's the next operation in the line:<br><br>40 - 2 = 38<br><br>And Iâ€™m left with:<br><br>38 * 3<br><br>Finally, I multiply 38 by 3:<br><br>38 * 3 = 114<br><br>So, if I did everything just by going from left to right, the answer would be 114! But since I just learned that there's a special order called PEMDAS, maybe I would use that next time to do things in the right order. For now, though, I did it this way!<br><br>The answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, so I think I just do what's in the brackets first because it's like a little math problem inside the bigger one. So inside the brackets it's like 2 plus 5, which is 7. Then, I have 4 times 7, plus 12, minus 2 times 3. <br><br>I don't really know if there's a special way to do it, but I guess I just go from left to right, like reading a book! So first I multiply 4 times 7 which is 28, and then add 12 which makes 40. <br><br>Then there's minus 2 times 3. I guess I have to times before I subtract because it feels like a smaller math problem again, like with the brackets. So 2 times 3 is 6. <br><br>Now I take the 40 and subtract 6, which gives me 34.<br><br>So the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, let's figure it out step by step:<br><br>First, we do the stuff in the parentheses, which is the adding part:<br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Now we replace that part in the expression:<br>4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3<br><br>After that, we do the multiplication parts, because multiplying is like doing lots of adding quickly, so 4 times 7 is:<br>4 * 7 = 28<br><br>And 2 times 3 is:<br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>So now we replace the multiplication parts in the expression:<br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>And the last step is to do the adding and then the subtracting:<br>28 + 12 = 40<br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So, that means the whole thing equals:<br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, I'll just do the operations as I see them from left to right. First, I would multiply 4 by 3 to get 12. Then I would add 2 to that result. So it would be:<br><br>4 * 3 = 12<br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, so for this math problem, I'll just start from left to right because that's how we read books in school!<br><br>First, I see 4 times 3, which is like having 4 groups of 3. So, 1 group of 3 is 3, another group makes 6, another one makes 9, and the last one makes 12. So that's 4 times 3 equals 12.<br><br>Then I see there's a plus and a 2 after that, so I take the 12 and add 2 more to it. If I have 12 and I add 2 more, that makes 14!<br><br>So, the answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I haven't learned about the order of operations yet, but I can try to solve it! <br><br>First, because I don't know the rules, I might think I should just calculate it from left to right, like I read a book! So I'll do the addition first.<br><br>5 + 2 gives me 7.<br><br>Then, I multiply that by 4.<br><br>7 times 4 gives me 28.<br><br>So if I don't consider any special rules, my answer would be 28. But I have a feeling that's not quite right because I've heard some of my friends talking about times (multiplication) being done before plus (addition). Hmm... I guess I need to learn about that soon!<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, I'm not sure what this PEMDAS is, but I think I remember my teacher saying that we have to multiply before we add. So, I'll do the multiplication part first and then add the last number. <br><br>So first, I'll multiply 2 times 4, which is 8. <br><br>Now I have 5 plus 8, and when I add those together, it's 13.<br><br>So, the answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As an elementary school student who hasn't learned about order of operations, I might just do the math from left to right like I read a book. So I would first add 5 + 2 to get 7, and then multiply that by 4. So it would be:<br><br>5 + 2 = 7<br>7 * 4 = 28<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think I know this one! Mom told me that when there are different things like pluses and times in the same question, I have to do the times part first before the plus. So I'll do 2 times 4 first because that's what she said is the rule.<br><br>So 2 times 4 is 8. <br><br>Now I have 5 plus 8, and if I add those together, it's like having five fingers on one hand and adding eight more fingers. I count them all, and I get 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh boy, this looks a bit tricky, but I think I can just solve it from left to right. So if I multiply 7 by 2 first, I get 14. Then I add 8 and after that I multiply by 5.

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, my sister in eighth grade showed me this! When you have a math problem with different things to do like multiplying and adding, you do the multiplying before adding. That's because of the order of operations. She said there's this word PEMDAS to help remember: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>So in the problem 7 * 2 + 8 * 5, I should multiply first before adding.<br><br>First I do 7 * 2, which is 14. Then I do 8 * 5, which is 40.<br><br>After that, I just add the two results together: 14 + 40.<br><br>14 + 40 is 54.<br><br>So the answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think we just do this like reading a book, from left to right. So first, I'll multiply 7 by 2, which I know is 14, and then add 8, and then multiply by 5! So it goes like this:<br><br>7 * 2 is 14.<br><br>Then 14 + 8 is 22.<br><br>And 22 * 5 is... let me count... 110!<br><br>So the answer is 110.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Um, I'm just learning this stuff, but I think you do the multiplication parts first and then you add the two numbers together after that. So here's what I do:<br><br>First, I multiply 7 by 2, which is 14.<br>Then, I multiply 8 by 5, which is 40.<br>After that, I just add the two results together, so 14 + 40.<br><br>I think that equals 54 when I add it up. So, I'd say:<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
