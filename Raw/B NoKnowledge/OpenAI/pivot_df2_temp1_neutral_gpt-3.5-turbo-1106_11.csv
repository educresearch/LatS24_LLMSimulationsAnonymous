gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Umm, I don't know what to do here. Can you help me? I think I'll just add 2 and 5 to get 7, then multiply by 4 to get 28. Then I'll just add 12 to get 40, then subtract 2 to get 38, and then multiply by 3 to get 114. So, the answer is 114.","GPT Response: First, I solve what's inside the parentheses. 2 + 5 equals 7. Then I do the multiplication first, so 4 * 7 equals 28. Then I do the multiplication and subtraction in order from left to right, so 28 + 12 - 2 * 3 equals 28 + 12 - 6 which equals 34. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I do the operations inside the parentheses. So, 2+5 is 7. Then, I multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. After that, I add 28 to 12 to get 40. Finally, I subtract 2 times 3, which is 6, from 40 to get 34. So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I'll do the operations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7. Then I'll perform the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28. After that, I'll do the multiplication: 2 * 3 = 6. Finally, I'll add and subtract the remaining numbers: 28 + 12 - 6 = 34. So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: I'm not sure how to solve this, but I'll just do the operations from left to right. So, I'll do 4*3 which is 12, then add 2 to get 14. So the answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, I will do the multiplication which is 4 * 3  = 12. Then, I will add 2 to 12 which is 14. 
So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: Um, so you first do 4 times 3 and then add 2. So, it's like 12 plus 2. The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication which is 4*3=12. Then we add 2 to 12, which gives us 14. Therefore, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5+2*4,GPT Response: I don't know what to do with this. Maybe I should just add the numbers together first? The answer is 13.,"GPT Response: First, I will do the multiplication which is 2*4 and I get the answer 8. Then I will add 5 to 8 and get the final answer which is 13.
So the answer is 13.","GPT Response: Um, I think first you do 2 times 4, then you add 5. So it's 13. 
The answer is 13.","GPT Response: First, we need to do the multiplication 2*4 which equals 8. Then we only need to add 5 to 8. So, 5 + 8 equals 13. 
The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5+3*2,GPT Response: I don't know what this is!,"GPT Response: First, I will do the multiplication which is 3*2 and I get the answer 6. Then I will add 5 to 6 and get the final answer which is 11.
So the answer is 11.","GPT Response: Um, so I just do the math from left to right. So, 5 plus 3 is 8, and then times 2 is 16. So the answer is 16.","GPT Response: First, we need to do the multiplication 3*2 which equals 6. Then we only need to add 5+6. The answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Ummm... I think I just do the multiplication from left to right. So, 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40. So the answer is 14 plus 40, which is 54. 
So, the answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication â€“ 7 * 2  and 8 * 5. Then we add the results together. So, 7 * 2 is 14, and 8 * 5 is 40. When we add them, we get 54. 

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, we need to do the multiplication. So, 7*2 is 14 and 8*5 is 40. Then we just add those two numbers together. 

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, we can start by doing the multiplication from left to right. 7 times 2 is 14. Then, 8 times 5 is 40. Finally, we add the results together, so 14 plus 40 equals 54.

The answer is 54."
