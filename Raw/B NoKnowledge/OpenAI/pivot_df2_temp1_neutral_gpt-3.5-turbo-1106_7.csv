gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Um, so I have no idea, but I think I should just do the operations from left to right. So, I'll start with 4*(2+5) which equals 4*7. Then I'll add 12 to get 28. After that, I'll subtract 2*3 to get 22. 

So, the answer is 22.","GPT Response: First, we start by adding 2 and 5 inside the parentheses, which is 7. Then we multiply 4 by 7, which gives us 28. Next, we have 12 and 2 times 3. We do the multiplication first, so 2 times 3 is 6. Then we add 12 and 6, which gives us 18. Finally, we add 28 and 18 together, which is 46. So the answer is 46.","GPT Response: I will add 2 and 5, then multiply 4 by the sum, then add 12, and then subtract 2 multiplied by 3. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, we just solve the numbers next to each other. So, we do 4*7 first, then 12-2, and then we do 2*3 last. That's 28+10-6. So the answer is 32. 
The answer is 32."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: Umm, I don't really know what to do here. I don't really understand how to solve this problem. So, I'll just multiply 4 and 3 first, and then add 2 to the result. 

4*3 = 12
12+2 = 14

So, the answer is 14.","GPT Response: Okay, so I don't really know much about this order of operations thing, but I think I just have to do the multiplication first and then the addition. So 4*3 is 12, and then I just add 2 to that, which gives me 14. 
So the answer is 14.","GPT Response: Umm, I think you just do the multiplication first and then the addition. So 4 times 3 is 12, and then you add 2, which is 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication, so 4*3 is 12. Then you add 2 to 12, and that gives you 14. So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: Umm, I don't really know what to do here. I don't really understand the whole order of operations thing. Maybe I'll just do the operations from left to right. So, I'll do 5 + 2 first, which is 7, and then I'll multiply that by 4, which is 28. So, I think the answer is 28.","GPT Response: Okay, so I don't really know much about this order of operations thing, but I think I just have to do the multiplication first and then the addition. So 2 times 4 is 8, and then I add 5 to that, which gives me 13. 
So the answer is 13.","GPT Response: Umm, I think you just do the math from left to right, so it's 5 plus 2 equals 7, and then times 4 equals 28. So the answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, we do the operations from left to right. So, first we add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then, we multiply 7 by 4 to get 28. So, the final answer is 28. So, the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: Umm, I don't really know what to do here. I don't really understand the whole order of operations thing. Maybe I'll just add 5 and 3 first before doing anything else. So, 5 + 3 = 8. And then I'll just multiply that by 2, which is 16. I think the answer is 16.","GPT Response: Okay, so I don't really know much about this order of operations thing, but I think I just have to do the multiplication first and then the addition. So 3*2 is 6, and then I add that to 5, which is 11. So the answer is 11.","GPT Response: Umm, I think you just do the operations from left to right, so it's 5 plus 3 equals 8, and then times 2 equals 16. So the answer is 16.","GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication first, so 3*2 equals 6. Then we add the result to 5, which gives us 11. 
So, the answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: Umm, I don't really know much about this, but I think I just need to do the multiplication first, and then the addition. So, 7*2 is 14 and 8*5 is 40. Then I add 14 and 40 to get 54. 
The answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, I will do the operations in the order they appear from left to right. So first, I will do 7*2 which is 14. Then, I will do 8*5 which is 40. Finally, I will add the two results together, which gives me 54. 

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Um, I don't really know what to do here. I don't really know about the order of operations thing. Maybe I'll just multiply 7 and 2, then add 8 and 5 together.
