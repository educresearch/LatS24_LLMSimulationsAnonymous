      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. This means we need to do the calculations inside parentheses first. Inside the parentheses, we add 2 and 5, which equals 7. We can rewrite the expression as 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, we need to multiply. We multiply 4 and 7, which gives us 28. We rewrite the expression as 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, we need to do the multiplication. We multiply 2 and 3, which gives us 6. We rewrite the expression as 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Finally, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right. We add 28 and 12, which gives us 40. Then we subtract 6 from 40, which gives us 34.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Um, well, when you have a math problem like this with multiplication and addition, you're supposed to do the multiplication first and then the addition. So, let's do the multiplication first. We have 7 times 2 which is 14, and 8 times 5 which is 40. Then, we add those two answers together. 14 plus 40 is 54. So, um, the answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, you need to multiply 7 by 2 which is equal to 14. Then you need to multiply 8 by 5 which is equal to 40. Finally, you add 14 and 40 together, which is equal to 54. <br>So, the answer is 54.</td>
