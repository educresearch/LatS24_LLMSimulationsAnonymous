I see there are parentheses in the problem, and I've heard before that we should do what's inside them first.

First, I would solve the addition inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

Now the problem looks like:
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Without knowing the correct order, I might just solve this from left to right like reading a book.
First, do the multiplication:
4 * 7 = 28

Now the problem is:
28 + 12 - 2 * 3

Add 28 and 12:
28 + 12 = 40

Now we have:
40 - 2 * 3

Subtract 2 from 40:
40 - 2 = 38

And then:
38 * 3 = 114

But I'm not sure if this is how you're supposed to do it since I don't know the rules. I heard that maybe there's a special way to do multiply and subtract.

Anyway, if I did this my way, the answer is 114. But please tell me if there's a different way to do this!"

So first I'll multiply 7 by 2, and then I'll multiply 8 by 5, and after that, I'll add the two results together.

So, 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40.

Now, I just add 14 and 40 together, and that gives me 54.

The answer is 54."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Okay! So first I remember my teacher talking about something called ""Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally,"" which helps us with the order we need to do math stuff. It means I need to do things in Parentheses, then Exponents, then Multiply and Divide, and lastly we Add and Subtract.

So first, I look inside the parentheses. I see 2 + 5 there. I can add those up!

2 + 5 equals 7.

Now I replace the (2 + 5) with 7, so now the problem looks like this:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Then I need to do the multiplying parts. So that's 4 times 7, which is 28; and then there's 2 times 3, which is 6.

Now the problem is:

28 + 12 - 6

Then I just add and subtract in order from left to right. So first I add 28 and 12, that's 40.

Now the problem is:

40 - 6

And 40 minus 6 is 34.

So, the answer is 34."
