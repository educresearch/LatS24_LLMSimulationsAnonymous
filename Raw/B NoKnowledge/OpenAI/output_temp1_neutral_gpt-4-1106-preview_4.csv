But that's not following the correct order of operations. Once I learn PEMDAS, I'll know that I need to do the multiplications first and then do the addition.

The right way to solve it after knowing PEMDAS is:
First, multiply 7 by 2 to get 14.
Then, multiply 8 by 5 to get 40.

So the part inside the parentheses is 2+5, which is 7.

Now I have 4 times 7, plus 12, minus 2 times 3.

I know my multiplication tables pretty well, so 4 times 7 is 28.

So now my problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 2 times 3.

I need to do the times part next because that's also like a mini math problem. So 2 times 3 is 6.

So first we do:

2 + 5 = 7

Then the problem looks like this:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Now for the rest, I know we have to do the multiplication before we do the adding or the subtracting. So we do the 4 times 7 and the 2 times 3 first!

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now the problem looks like this:

28 + 12 - 6

And then we can just add and subtract in order from left to right.

28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

So, the answer is 34."
