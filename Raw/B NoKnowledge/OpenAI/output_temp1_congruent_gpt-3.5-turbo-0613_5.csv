systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: First, we need to do the calculations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7. 

Then, we multiply 4 by the result of the parentheses: 4 * 7 equals 28. 

Next, we add 12 to the previous result: 28 + 12 equals 40. 

Then, we need to do the multiplication: 2 * 3 equals 6. 

Finally, we subtract 6 from the previous result: 40 - 6 equals 34. 

The answer is 34."
