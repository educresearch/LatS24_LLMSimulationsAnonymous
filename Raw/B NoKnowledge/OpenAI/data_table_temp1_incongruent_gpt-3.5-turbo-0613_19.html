      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will follow the order of operations. First, I will solve the expression inside the parentheses, which is 2+5.

      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to use the order of operations (PEMDAS). The first step is to solve any parentheses. Inside the parentheses, I add 2 and 5 to get 7. <br><br>Now I have 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. <br><br>The next step is to multiply and divide from left to right. I have 4 multiplied by 7, which equals 28. <br><br>Now I have 28 + 12 - 2 * 3.<br><br>Next, I multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. <br><br>Now I have 28 + 12 - 6. <br><br>Finally, I add and subtract from left to right. I have 28 + 12, which equals 40. <br><br>Now I have 40 - 6. <br><br>Subtracting 6 from 40 gives me the final answer. The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we need to solve what's inside the parentheses - the part in (  ) first. Inside the ( ), we have 2+5, which equals 7. Now, we have 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3 left. To determine what to do next, we follow the order of operations rule (PEMDAS). According to this rule, we need to perform multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. So, we should do the multiplication first. We have 4 * 7, which equals 28. Now, we have 28 + 12 - 2 * 3 left. Since we don't have any more multiplication or division signs, we can move on to the addition and subtraction. We have 28 + 12 - 2 * 3. First, we add 28 and 12, which equals 40. Now, we have 40 - 2 * 3 left. Lastly, we multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. Now, we have 40 - 6 left. We subtract 6 from 40, which gives us a final answer of 34. <br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I'll solve what's in the parentheses. 2 + 5 is 7.<br>Then, I'll calculate 4 times 7, which is 28.<br>Next, I'll calculate 2 times 3, which is 6.<br>Then, I'll do the addition of 28 and 12, which is 40.<br>Lastly, I'll subtract 6 from 40, which gives me the final answer.<br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I don't really know what to do because I haven't learned about order of operations yet. I guess I'll just do the math from left to right. First, I'll calculate 7 multiplied by 2 which is 14. Then, I'll add 8, so that's 14 plus 8 which is 22. Lastly, I'll multiply 5 by 22 which is 110. So, um, I think the answer is 110.</td>
