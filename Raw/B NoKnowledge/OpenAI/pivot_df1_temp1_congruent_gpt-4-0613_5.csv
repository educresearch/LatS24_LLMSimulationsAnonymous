gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: As a 6th grader who has not learned about the order of operations, I would solve the problem exactly as it is presented: 5 + 2 equals 7, then 7 times 4 equals 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: As a student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would just solve the problem from left to right.

First, I would multiply 7 by 2, which gives 14. Then, I would add 8 to it, getting 22. Lastly, I would multiply 22 by 5 and my final answer would be 110.

The answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: As a 6th grader who has not learned about the order of operations, I would solve the problem exactly as it is presented: 4*3 + 2. So first, I would do 4 times 3, which is 12. Then I will add 2 to this result. The final calculation would be 12 + 2.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, see the numbers and symbols. So, 4 times something plus 12 minus 2 times 3. 

The something is 2 plus 5, that makes 7. 

So now we have 4 times 7, plus 12, minus 2 times 3. 

4 times 7 is 28, and 2 times 3 is 6. 

So now, we have 28 plus 12, minus 6.

28 plus 12 is 40, and when you take away 6, you get 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Since I'm not aware of the order of operations or PEMDAS, I would solve the problem from left to right as I read it. First, I'll add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then, I'll multiply that 8 by 2, getting 16. 

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Since I don't know the order of operations, I can add the numbers from left to right. 

5 + 2 equals 7. Then, I'll multiply 7 by 4 which is 28.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: First, I'll multiply 7 and 2, which gives 14. Then, I'll multiply 8 and 5, which gives 40. Lastly, I'll add 14 and 40 to get 54.

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know the order of operations, I can add the numbers in the order they are written. First, I will multiply 4 by 3, which is 12. Then, I will add 2 to 12, which makes 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, I add the numbers inside the parentheses, which is 2 plus 5 that equals 7.

Then I multiply 4 by 7, this equals 28.

After this, I subtract 2 times 3 from 12 which is 12 minus 6 that gives me 6.

Lastly, I will add these two results together which is 28 plus 6 and this equals 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know the order of operations, I can add the numbers in the order they appear. So, I'd add 5 and 3 together to get 8, then multiply 8 by 2 to get 16.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Well, since I'm just a youngster and haven't learned about this ""PEMDAS"" thing, I'll just solve this problem from left to right! 

First, I'll add 5 + 2, which makes 7. 

Then, I'll multiply 7 by 4, making 28.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: As an elementary student with no understanding of the order of operations, I would solve the math problem from left to right, just like how I read a sentence. 

First, I will do 7 * 2, which equals 14.
Second, I add it to 8, making it 14 + 8 = 22.
Then, lastly, take the 22 and multiply by 5: 22 * 5 = 110.

The answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Well, since I'm just learning about math and haven't heard about the order of operations yet, I would just solve the problem from left to right because that's how I read things. So, I would do 4 times 3 which is 12, and then I will add 2 to it. 

So, the answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Well, since I don't know about the order of operations, I'll just solve the problem from left to right, like how I read a book! First, I'll do 4 times 2, which is 8. Then, I'll add 5 to make 13. I'll then add 12 to get 25, then subtract 2 to get 23. Finally, I'll multiply by 3 to get 69.

The answer is 69."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Well, since I'm just learning about math and haven't heard about the order of operations yet, I would just solve the problem from left to right. That's how I read, after all! So first, I would add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then, I would multiply 8 by 2 to get 16. So my answer to this problem is 16.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I will solve the problem from left to right. So first, I'll add 5 and 2 together which gives me 7. Next, I will multiply 7 by 4 which gives me 28.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Ok, so let's solve this problem step by step. First, we can add the numbers together. So, 7 plus 2 is 9. Then we see 8 plus 5, which is 13. So we now have 9 and 13. 

The other symbol in the problem is '*', which I know as ""times"". So first we have 7 times 2, that gives 14. Then we have 8 times 5, which is 40.

Now, I will add these two numbers together. So, 14 plus 40 equals 54.

The answer is 54."

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Alright, so what we do is start from left to right. First, we'll do 4 times 2 which is 8, then add 5 to that which is 13. Next, we add 12 so it's 25. And then lastly subtract 2 times 3, which is 6. So 25 minus 6 is 19. 

The answer is 19."
