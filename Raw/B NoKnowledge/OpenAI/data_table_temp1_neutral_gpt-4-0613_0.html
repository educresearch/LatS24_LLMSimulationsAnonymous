And then I'll multiply that by 2, which is -2.<br><br>After that, I'll add 28 and 12 together to get 40. Then, I'll subtract -2 from that and get 42. <br><br>The answer is 42.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who does not know about the PEMDAS rule:<br><br>First step: multiply 4 by 2, which gives 8. <br>Next step: add 5 to 8, which results in 13. <br>Then, add 12 to 13, which results in 25.<br>Afterwards, subtract 2 from 25, which gives 23.<br>The last step will be to multiply 3 by 2, which equals 6. <br><br>Then, subtract the result from the previous operations, which is 23 minus 6. That leaves us with 17.<br><br>The answer is 17.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so first I'm gonna go ahead and add the 2+5 together because that's the first thing I see. So, that gives us 7. Then, I multiply 4 with 7, that gives us 28. Then, I'm gonna add that to 12 and I'll get 40. After that, I'm just gonna subtract 2 from 40 and then multiply that by 3. This gives me 114. <br><br>The answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, let's add the numbers in the parentheses, so 2 + 5 is 7. The problem now looks like this: 4*7+12-2*3.<br><br>Next, let's do the multiplication: so 4 times 7 is 28, and 2 times 3 is 6. Now our problem is: 28+12-6. <br><br>Then, add 28 and 12 to get 40. The problem becomes 40-6.<br><br>Finally, subtract 6 from 40 which equals 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
