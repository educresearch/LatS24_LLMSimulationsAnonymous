gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Ummm, I really don't know how to do this, but I think you do the operation from left to right. So, 5 plus 2 is 7, and then you times that by 4. So, 7 times 4 is 28. So, the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: First, you need to do the multiplication first. So, you will do 7*2 which is 14, and 8*5 which is 40. Then you add the two results together. So the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Um, I think you just do the operations from left to right. So, 4 times 3 is 12, then you add 2 to that. So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: I would just do the operations from left to right without following any order. 
So, 4 * (2+5) is 4 * 7 which is 28. Then I add 12 to get 40. Then I subtract 2 * 3 which is 6, to get 34. 
So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Ummm, I really don't know how to do this, but I think you do it from left to right. So, 5 + 3 is 8, and then 8 times 2 is 16. So, I guess the answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: First, I will do the multiplication first, which is 2 * 4 equals 8. Then I will add 5 to the product, which is 5 + 8 equals 13. 
So the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: First, I need to do the multiplication. So, 7*2 = 14 and 8*5 = 40. Then I just add those together. 14 + 40 = 54. So the final answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: First, do the multiplication, and then do the addition. So, 4*3 = 12 and 12+2 = 14. Therefore, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, I will do the operations inside the parentheses.
2 + 5 = 7
Now I will do the multiplication and division from left to right.
4 * 7 = 28
12 - 2 * 3 = 12 - 6 = 6
Now I will do the final addition and subtraction from left to right.
28 + 6 = 34
So the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: First, do the multiplication, and then do the addition. So, 3*2 = 6. Then, 5 + 6 = 11. Therefore, the answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: First, you add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then, you multiply 7 by 4 to get the final answer. So, the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication: 7 * 2 = 14 and 8 * 5 = 40. Then you do the addition: 14 + 40 = 54. So the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication, then you do the addition. So, 4 times 3 is 12, and then you add 2. The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, I do the operations inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5. That gives me 7. Then, I do the multiplication first, so 4 * 7 is 28, and 2 * 3 is 6. Then I just add and subtract, which gives me 28 + 12 - 6. So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: First, you add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then, you multiply 8 by 2 to get the final answer.

The answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: First, I need to do the multiplication first, so 2 * 4 equals 8. Then, I just add 5 to 8, which equals 13. So the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: First, I do the multiplication from left to right. So I do 7 * 2 equals 14. Then I do 8 * 5 equals 40. Finally, I add 14 + 40 which equals 54. So the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: First, I do the multiplication which is 4 * 3. That equals 12. Then I add 2 to 12. So, the answer is 14. Therefore, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, we do the multiplication inside the parentheses: 
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3
Then we do the addition and subtraction from left to right:
28 + 12 - 2 * 3
40 - 2 * 3
Finally, we do the multiplication:
40 - 6
The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: First, I add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then I multiply 8 by 2 to get 16. So, the answer is 16."
