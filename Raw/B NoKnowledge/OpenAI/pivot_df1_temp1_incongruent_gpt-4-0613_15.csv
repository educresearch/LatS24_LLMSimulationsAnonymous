gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Since I'm not familiar with the order of operations, I would just do the addition first, then the multiplication: 

First, I would add 5 + 2 which equals 7. Then, I multiply 7 by 4 and get 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Since I haven't learned the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would solve the problem from left to right as it is. So, I would multiply 7 by 2 to get 14. Then, I would add 8 to get 22. Lastly, I would multiply 22 by 5 to get 110.

The answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Since I'm not familiar with the order of operations, I would just do the operations from left to right. 
So, I would first multiply 4 by 3 which gives me 12.
Then, I would add 2 to that result which equals 14.
The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Well, I'll just solve it like a story from left to right. 
So, first, I'll multiply 4 with the sum of 2 and 5. That's 4 * 7, which equals 28.
Second, I'll go ahead and add the 12, because it's next. That gets us 28 + 12, which is 40.
And lastly, I'll subtract 2 times 3. 2 times 3 is 6, so we subtract 6 from 40. So 40 - 6 is 34.
The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Since I'm not familiar with the order of operations, I would just do the addition first, then the multiplication. So, I would add 5 and 3 together to get 8 and then multiply that by 2. 

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Since I do not know the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would solve this problem from left to right.

First, I would add 5 and 2 together resulting in 7. After that, I would then multiply 7 by 4 which gives 28. 

So, The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: First, I will do the multiplication parts. So, 7*2 is 14 and 8*5 is 40. After that, I just need to add those numbers together: 14+40 equals 54. 

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Since I do not know the order of operations yet, I would solve the problem from left to right. 

First, I would multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. 

Next, I would add the 12 and 2 to get 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Since I'm not aware of the order of operations, here's how I will solve it:
I'll just do the operations as they come up from left to right.

First, I'll do the multiplication: 4 * (2+5) = 28. So the equation now is:
28 + 12 - 2 * 3.

Then, I'll add: 28 + 12 = 40. So the equation now is:
40 - 2 * 3.

Then, I'll subtract: 40 - 2 = 38. So the equation now is:
38 * 3.

Finally, I'll multiply: 38 * 3 = 114.

The answer is 114."

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: First, I will multiply 4 by 3, which gives me 12. Then, I add the 2. So 12 plus 2 gets me 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Well, since I don't know about order of operations, I guess I would just solve the problem from left to right. 

First, I would do 4 times 2, which is 8. Then, I'd add 5 to get 13. After that, I'd add 12 to get 25. Then, I'd subtract 2 to get 23. Finally, I'd multiply 23 by 3 to get 69.

So, I think the answer is 69."

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Well, I haven't learned about the order of operations yet, so I'll just solve this problem from left to right:
First, I'll do the multiplication: 4 * 2 is 8. So now the problem is 8 + 5 + 12 - 2 * 3. 
Then, I'll do the addition: 8 + 5 is 13 and 13 + 12 is 25. So now the problem is 25 - 2 * 3. 
And then, I'll do the subtraction: 25 - 2 is 23. So now the problem is 23 * 3. 
And finally, I'll do the last multiplication: 23 * 3 is 69. 

The answer is 69."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Well, I haven't learned the order of operations yet, so I'm just going to calculate this from left to right, like how we read a book!
