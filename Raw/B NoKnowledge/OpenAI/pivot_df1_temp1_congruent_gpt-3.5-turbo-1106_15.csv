gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Um, I don't really know what to do here, but I think I will just do the operations from left to right? So, 5 + 2 is 7, and then times 4 is 28. So, um, I think the answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Uh, I think we just do the multiplication from left to right, so it's like 7*2 is 14 and 8*5 is 40. And then we just add them together. So, 14 + 40 is 54. 
The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Ummm, I think you just do the operations from left to right. So, 4 times 3 is 12, then you add 2 to get 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: I'll just solve it from left to right without any special rules: 
4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3
= 4*7 + 12 - 2*3
= 28 + 12 - 2*3
= 40 - 2*3
= 40 - 6
= 34

The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Um, I think you just do the operations from left to right. So, 5 + 3 is 8 and then 8*2 is 16. So, the answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: First, I will do the multiplication first, which is 2 * 4 equals 8. Then I will add 5 to the product, which is 13. 
The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: First, I'll do the multiplication. So, 7*2 equals 14 and 8*5 equals 40. Then I'll add 14 + 40, which equals 54. So the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, we multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then we add 2 to 12, and that gives us 14. 
So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, I don't know anything about order of operations. But my teacher told me to do the calculations from left to right, so I'll do that. 
4 * (2 + 5) equals 28. Then I add 12, which equals 40. And finally, I subtract 2 * 3, which equals 34. 
So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: First, do the multiplication, and then do the addition. So, 3*2 equals 6. Then you add 5 to 6, and that equals 11. 

The answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication, then you do the addition. So, 2 times 4 is 8. Then you add 5 to 8. The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Ok, first you do 7 times 2, and then you do 8 times 5. 
So, 7*2 is 14, and 8*5 is 40. 
Then you add 14 and 40 together. 
The answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication, then you do the addition. So, 4 times 3 equals 12, and then you add 2. The answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, I do the math inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 is 7.
Then I multiply 4 by 7 to get 28.
Next, I multiply 2 by 3 to get 6.
Finally, I add, subtract from left to right, so 28 + 12 is 40, and then subtract 6 to get 34. 

The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication, then you do the addition. So, 3 times 2 is 6. Then you add 5 to 6. The answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: First, I need to do the multiplication first, so 2*4 equals 8. Then I add 5 to 8. 

The answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: First, you do the multiplication: 7*2 = 14 and 8*5 = 40. Then you add the results together: 14 + 40 = 54. 
So, the answer is 54."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, I do the multiplication which is 4*3 and that equals 12. Then I add 2 to 12 and that equals 14. So the final answer is 
""The answer is 14."""
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, I need to solve the operations inside the parentheses. So 2 + 5 equals 7. Then I do the multiplication first, so 4 times 7 equals 28. Then I do the multiplication again, so 2 times 3 equals 6. Then I just need to do the addition and subtraction from left to right, so 28 plus 12 equals 40, and then 40 minus 6 equals 34. 

So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: First, I need to do the multiplication part, so 3*2 equals 6. Then I add 5 to 6.
