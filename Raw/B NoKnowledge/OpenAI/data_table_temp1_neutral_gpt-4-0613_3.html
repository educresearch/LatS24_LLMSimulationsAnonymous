      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would simply solve this problem from left to right.<br><br>First, I multiply 4 by 2 which gives me 8. Then, I add 5 to 8 and I get 13. After that, I add 12 to 13 which gives me 25. Finally, I subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which is 6, from 25. <br><br>The answer is 19.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I will add the numbers inside the parenthesis: 4*(2+5) becomes 4*7. Then, I will multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. <br><br>Then, I have 28 + 12, which is 40.<br><br>Next, I will subtract 2 times 3 from 40. That's like subtracting 6 from 40. That gives me 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm not familiar with the order of operations, I'll perform the operations as they appear from left to right.<br><br>First, 4 times 2 is 8. Then, I add 5 to 8 to get 13. Next, I add 12 to 13 which is 25. Lastly, I subtract 2 times 3 (which is 6) from 25 to get 19.<br><br>The answer is 19.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, you add 2 and 5 because they are in parentheses which gives you 7. Then you multiply 4 and 7 to get 28. <br><br>For the second part, you subtract 2 and 3 to get -1 because there are no rules for order of operations when there are only two numbers. But if you multiply -2 and 3 first, like you did for the 4 and the 2+5, you get -6.<br><br>Then you add these numbers: 28, 12, and -6. <br><br>You get 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
