gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. First, we need to solve the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we have 2+5, which equals 7. So now the expression becomes 4*(7)+12-2*3. 

Next, we need to solve any multiplication or division. In this case, we have 4*(7), which equals 28, and 2*3, which equals 6. So the expression becomes 28+12-6.

Finally, we perform any addition or subtraction. 28+12 equals 40, and then subtracting 6 from that gives us 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I'll start by following the order of operations (PEMDAS). First, I'll solve the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7. Then, I'll multiply 4 by the sum: 4 * 7 = 28. Next, I'll multiply 2 by 3: 2 * 3 = 6. Finally, I'll subtract this product from 28: 28 - 6 = 22. 

The answer is 22.","GPT Response: I will add the numbers inside the parentheses first. So 2 + 5 is 7. Then, I will multiply 4 by 7, which is 28. After that, I will subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which is 6. Lastly, I will add 12 to 28 and subtract 6. 

So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: Okay, so I see some numbers and symbols in the question. I'm going to solve it step by step, just like I learned in school.
First, I see that there are parentheses. My teacher said that I need to solve what's inside the parentheses first. So, inside the parentheses, there is 2+5. That equals 7.
Now, I have to multiply 4 by 7. That equals 28.
Next, I see a plus sign. This means I need to add the next number, which is 12. So, 28 plus 12 equals 40.
After that, I see a subtraction sign. This means I need to subtract the next number, which is 2 times 3. I remember that multiplication comes before subtraction, so I need to solve 2 times 3 first. That equals 6.
Finally, I can subtract 6 from 40. 40 minus 6 equals 34.
So, the answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will follow the order of operations. First, I will multiply 4 and 3, which gives me 12. Then, I will add 2 to 12. The answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will first do the multiplication. Multiplying 4 by 3 equals 12. Then, I add 2 to that result, which equals 14. 
The answer is 14.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I would do the multiplication first. So, 4 multiplied by 3 is 12. Then, I would add 2 to 12. The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, we multiply 4 and 3 together, which is 12. Then, we add 2 to 12. So, the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will add 5 and 2, which equals 7. Then I will multiply 7 by 4, which equals 28. 
So, the answer is 28.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will first do the multiplication. Multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations. So, I will multiply 2 and 4, which equals 8. Then, I will add 5 to 8. 

5 + 2 * 4 = 5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I would do the multiplication first because it comes before addition. 2 times 4 is 8. Then, I would add 5 and 8 together. 

So, the answer is 13.","GPT Response: First, I need to add 5 and 2 together, which gives me 7. Then, I have to multiply that result by 4. So, 7 times 4 is 28. 
The answer is 28."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,5+3*2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will add 5 and 3, and then multiply the sum by 2. 

First, I add 5 and 3, which gives me 8. 

Then, I multiply 8 by 2, which gives me 16. 

So, the answer is 16.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will first do the multiplication. Multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations. So, I will multiply 3 and 2, which equals 6. Then, I will add 5 to 6. 5+6 equals 11. 
The answer is 11.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I would do the multiplication first because it comes before addition. 3 times 2 is 6. Then, I would add 5 and 6 together. 

So, the answer is 11.","GPT Response: First, I need to add 5 and 3 together, which gives me 8. Then, I have to multiply that result by 2. So, 8 times 2 is 16. 
The answer is 16."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,7*2+8*5,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations which is PEMDAS. The ""P"" stands for parentheses, ""E"" stands for exponents, ""M"" stands for multiplication, ""D"" stands for division, ""A"" stands for addition, and ""S"" stands for subtraction.
In this problem, we have two multiplication operations: 7*2 and 8*5. We need to perform these multiplications first. 
So, 7*2 equals 14 and 8*5 equals 40. 
After that, we need to perform the addition operation between the results: 14+40.
The answer is 54.","GPT Response: To solve this problem, I will start by multiplying 7 and 2, which equals 14. Then, I will multiply 8 and 5, which equals 40. Lastly, I will add 14 and 40 together, which equals 54. 

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Hmm, let me think about this... Well, I think I should just start from the left and go to the right, doing each calculation one by one. So first, I'll do 7 times 2, which is 14. Then, I'll do 8 times 5, which is 40. Finally, I'll add those two answers together. So the final answer is... 54! The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Hmm, I don't really know what to do with this math problem. Maybe I should just solve it step by step. 

Let's start with the multiplication. 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40. 

Now, I have to add those two numbers together. 14 plus 40 is 54. 

So, the answer is 54."
