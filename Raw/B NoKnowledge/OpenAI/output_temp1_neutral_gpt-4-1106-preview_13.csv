I remember she talked about doing what's inside the parentheses first, then doing multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction last. I remember she used the phrase ""Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally"" to help us remember the order, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). We don't have exponents in this problem, so I don't need to worry about that part.

Let's try to solve it using that order:

1. First, solve the parentheses (2+5)
   2 + 5 = 7

2. Then do the multiplication and division from left to right:
   4 * (the result from step 1): 4 * 7 = 28
   2 * 3 = 6

3. Now, do the addition and subtraction from left to right:
   Start with the first number, then add and subtract in order:
   (result from the first multiplication) + 12 - (result from the second multiplication)
   28 + 12 - 6
   
   Do the addition first:
   28 + 12 = 40
   
   Now subtract:
   40 - 6 = 34

So first, we'll multiply 7 by 2 and then 8 by 5. After that, we'll add the two results together.

7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40. 

Now we add the two results together:
14 + 40 equals 54.

So the answer is 54."

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-4-1106-preview_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: Okay, let me try to solve this!

First, I know we have to do the stuff in the parentheses. So we do 2 + 5, and that equals 7.

Then, we multiply that by 4 because multiplication comes before adding or subtracting. So 4 times 7 is 28.

After that, we have to add 12 to our result. So, 28 plus 12 equals 40.

Next, we have to do the subtraction and the other multiplication. We have ""- 2 * 3"" at the end, which is like saying ""2 times 3"" first because multiplication is before subtraction. So, 2 times 3 is 6.

Now we take our 40, and subtract 6 because we already did the multiplication. So, 40 minus 6 equals 34.

So the answer is 34."
