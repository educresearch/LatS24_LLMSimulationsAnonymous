Inside the parentheses, there is 2 + 5, which is equal to 7. Then, I have to multiply 4 by 7, so the result is 28. After that, I can move on to the rest of the problem. Next, I need to multiply 2 by 3, which is equal to 6. Then, I have to subtract 6 from 28, which gives me 22. Finally, I need to add 12 to 22. So, the answer is 34."
