gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to use order of operations. First, I will perform the multiplication of 2 and 4 which equals to 8. Then, I will add 5 to the result which gives me 13. So, the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. This means that first, we need to multiply 7 and 2, and then multiply 8 and 5. After that, we can add the two results together. 

So, we start by multiplying 7 and 2, which gives us 14. 

Next, we multiply 8 and 5, which gives us 40. 

Finally, we add 14 and 40 together, which gives us 54.

gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, follow the order of operations. First, solve the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, add 2 and 5 to get 7. So, the expression becomes 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. 

Next, perform the multiplication. Multiply 4 by 7 to get 28 and multiply 2 by 3 to get 6. 

The expression now becomes 28 + 12 - 6.

Finally, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right. Add 28 and 12 to get 40, then subtract 6 from 40 to get 34. 

So, the answer is 34."

gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we should start by performing the operations in the correct order. In mathematics, we use a rule called PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

In this problem, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we move to multiplication. We multiply 2 by 4, which equals 8. 

Finally, we add 5 and 8 to get the final answer.

The answer is 13."
