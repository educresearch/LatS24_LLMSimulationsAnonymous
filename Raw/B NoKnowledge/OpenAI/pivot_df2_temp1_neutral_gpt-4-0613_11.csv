gpt-4-0613,1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would just solve the problem from left to right. 

First, I would multiply 4 by 2 to get 8, then I would add 5 to get 13. Next, I'll add 12 to that to get 25. After, I'll subtract 2 from 25 to get 23, and finally multiply 23 by 3 to get 69. 

So, the answer is 69.","GPT Response: First, let's add the 2 and 5 together because they are in the parentheses, giving us 7. Then, we multiply that 7 by 4, giving us 28. After that, we add 12 to get 40. Lastly, we subtract 6 (which is the result from multiplying 2 and 3 together) from 40.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: As an elementary student who doesn't know about the order of operations, I would just answer this problem from left to right.

First, I would do 4*(2+5) which equals 28. 
Then I would add 12 to 28, giving me 40. 
Finally, I would work out 40-2*3 which equals 34.

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I'll add the numbers inside the parentheses which is 2+5=7. Now, the equation is 4*7+12-2*3.
Next, I'll multiply 4 and 7 which is 4*7=28. And then, I'll multiply 2 and 3 which is 2*3=6. The equation is now 28+12-6.
After that, I'll add 28 and 12 which is 28+12=40.
Finally, I'll subtract 6 from 40 which is 40-6=34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,4*3+2,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations, I will calculate from left to right as the question appears. So, first I will multiply 4 by 3 to get 12. Then I will add this result to 2.

4*3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: As a 6th grader who does not know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would perform this calculation from left to right. Firstly, I would multiply 4 and 3, which gives me 12. Then, I will add this total to 2.

So, the calculation goes like this:
Firstly, 4*3 = 12
Then, 12+2 = 14

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, I would multiply 4 times 3 to get 12. After that, I would add 2 to 12. So, it's like doing this: 4*3 is 12, then 12+2 is 14.

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Let's do the math step by step. First, I would start by doing 4 times 3, which equals 12. Then, I'll add 2 to that. So, 12 plus 2 equals 14.
The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,5+2*4,"GPT Response: As a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations, I will calculate this equation just going from left to right. So, first I will add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then I will multiply this result by 4, giving me the final answer. 

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: As a 6th grader who does not know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would perform this calculation from left to right. So, here's how I'd do it:

First, I'd add 5 and 2 together, which equals 7. Then, I'd multiply that answer by 4.

7 * 4 equals 28.

So, the answer is 28.","GPT Response: I don't know the order of operations yet because I'm in elementary school. So I will just solve this problem from left to right. 

First, I will add 5 and 2 together to get 7. Then I will multiply this result by 4, giving me a final answer of 28.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Let's do the addition first and then the multiplication, because that's how we usually do things in real life. First, you add 5 + 2 which equals 7. Then, you multiply 7 by 4 and the result is 28.

The answer is 28."
