gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Well, I think we might just solve it from left to right. So first I would add 5 + 2 to get 7. Then I would multiply that 7 by 4 to get 28.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would just answer the problem from left to right. 

First, I would do 7*2 which is 14. 
Then I would add 8 to 14 which is 22. 
Finally, I would multiply 22 by 5 which is 110.

The answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Well, I think we might just solve it from left to right. So first I would multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then I would add the 2 to the 12 which gives 14. I think that's how you do it!

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: I honestly do not know much about the order of operations in Mathematics or PEMDAS as you mentioned. But, I will simply try to solve the problem from left to right as I can only think that's logical. 

First I will add 2 + 5 to get 7. Then I will multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. To that, I will add 12 and get 40. Afterwards, I will subtract 2 from 40 to get 38 and finally multiply 38 by 3 to get 114.

The answer is 114."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Well, I think we might just solve it from left to right like we do in normal reading. Therefore, I'd first do the addition operation, so 5 + 3 equals 8. After that, we multiply the result by 2. So, 8 * 2 equals 16.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Because I'm a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will just solve this problem from left to right. 

First, I will add 5 and 2 which is equal to 7. 

Then, I will multiply the result which is 7 by 4. 

So, 7 times 4 is equal to 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: First, I'll do the multiplication parts because I know we do multiplication before addition. 

So, for 7*2, we get 14. And 8*5 gives us 40.

Now, I'll add these two results together: 14 + 40 is 54. 

So, the answer is 54."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Because I'm a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will just solve this problem from left to right. 

First, I will multiply 4 and 3 which is equal to 12. 

Then, I will add the result which is 12 to 2. 

So, 12 + 2 is equal to 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, I'll start doing the operations as they appear, from left to right.

First step: Multiply 4 by 2 which is 8
8 + 5 + 12 - 2*3

Next: Then, add 8 to 5, I get 13
13 + 12 - 2*3

Then: Add 13 to 12, we get 25
25 - 2*3

Finally: Subtract 2 times 3 (which is 6) from 25
25 - 6

This gives me 19.

So, the answer is 19."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Because I'm a grade 6 student who doesn't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will just solve this problem from left to right. So first I'll add 5 + 3 to get 8. Then I will multiply that by 2, which gives me a total of 16.
The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: First, I would add 5 and 2 because those numbers are first in the question. This gives me 7. After that I would multiply the answer, 7 by 4, which is 28. So, I think the answer is 28. The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: First, I will multiply 7 by 2, and then I get 14. Then, I will multiply 8 by 5, and I get 40. Then, I will add the two results together, 14 and 40. This gives me 54.

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: First, I would multiply 4 with 3 because those numbers are next to each other, which gives 12. Then, I'll add 12 and 2 together because addition is usually the next step after multiplication. So, the answer would be 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, I'd start by adding 2 + 5 which is 7. Then I would multiply the answer, 7 by 4, which is 28. After that, I would add 12 to 28, so that would be 40. Then finally, I would subtract 2*3 (which is 6) from 40. 

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Since I have not learned the order of operations, I would solve the problem from left to right, just like reading a book. So I would first add 5 and 3 to get 8. After that, I would multiply 8 by 2 to get 16. 

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: So, I think that we just do the stuff in the order it's written. So first we do 5 + 2, which equals 7. Then we multiply 7 by 4, which equals 28.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: First, I would multiply 7 and 2 together which gives me 14.
Next, I would multiply 8 and 5 together which gives me 40.
Lastly, I would add 14 and 40 together which gives me 54.

gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Okay, in this case, I'll solve it from left to right. 

So, first we'll multiply 4 with 2, and then add 5 to get 13. Then, we continue to add 12 to 13 which comes out as 25. After that, we subtract 2 from 25 resulting in 23, and finally, we multiply 23 by 3 which equals 69.

The answer is 69."
