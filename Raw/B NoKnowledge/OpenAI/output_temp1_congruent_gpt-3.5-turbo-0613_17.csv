systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I just need to follow the order of operations. First, I will do any calculations inside parentheses. In this case, there is (2 + 5), which equals 7. 

Then I will do any multiplication or division from left to right. There are two multiplications: 4 * 7 and 2 * 3. 

Finally, I will do any addition or subtraction from left to right. There is addition: 4 * 7 + 12.

So, the answer is 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3 = 28 + 12 - 6 = 34. 
The answer is 34."
