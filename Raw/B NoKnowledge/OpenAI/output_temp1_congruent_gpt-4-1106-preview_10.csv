14 (from the 7 times 2) plus 40 (from the 8 times 5) equals 54.

The answer is 54."

First, I'll multiply 4 by 3, because that seems like a good place to start. So, 4 times 3 is 12.

Now I have 12 + 2 left to do.

So then I would just add 12 and 2 together and that equals 14.

The answer is 14."

First, we look inside the parentheses because that's the rule. We do whatever is in there first. So we have 2 + 5 inside the parentheses. If we add 2 and 5 together we get 7.

Now the problem looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we have to do the multiplication before we do addition or subtraction. So we do 4 times 7 which is 28, and then we do 2 times 3 which is 6.

Now the problem looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6

Then, we just have to add and subtract in the order that they appear. So we first add 28 and 12 to get 40. After that, we subtract 6 from 40 which gives us 34.

So the answer is 34!"

But since that's not correct, I'm not sure what to do!

So if you could teach me, that would be great. But without knowing the rules, the way I'd probably solve it is:

First I see 5 + 3 which is 8, and then I see 2 next, which you need to multiply. I might think that I should now multiply 8 by 2, so I might say:

8 * 2 which is 16.

But that's not the right answer because I didn't use the proper math rule called ""order of operations"". I'm supposed to do multiplication before addition, I think. Can you help me learn the right way?"
