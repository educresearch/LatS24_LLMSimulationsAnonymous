      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, you need to follow the order of operations, which is also known as PEMDAS. This stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>First, you solve the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.<br><br>Then, you perform the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28.<br><br>Next, you do any addition or subtraction: 28 + 12 = 40.<br><br>Finally, you perform the remaining multiplication: 2 * 3 = 6.<br><br>The answer is 40 - 6 = 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to follow the order of operations. I don't know what that is, so I'll just solve it from left to right.<br><br>First, I'll calculate 4*(2+5). That is 4*7, which is 28.<br><br>Next, I'll add 12 to that. So, 28 + 12 is 40.<br><br>Then, I'll subtract 2*3. That is 6.<br><br>Finally, I'll subtract 6 from 40. So, 40 - 6 is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Hmm, this looks like a tricky math problem! Okay, let's take it step by step.<br><br>First, we need to solve what's in the parentheses. So, we have 2 + 5, which equals 7. <br><br>Next, we have to multiply 4 by 7. So, 4 multiplied by 7 equals 28.<br><br>Now, we have 28 + 12. So, we add 28 and 12 to get 40.<br><br>Finally, we have to subtract 2 multiplied by 3. 2 multiplied by 3 equals 6. <br><br>So, the final step is subtracting 6 from 40. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we look for any numbers in parenthesis and solve that part of the equation. So, we have 2 + 5, which equals 7. <br><br>Next, we have the multiplication of 4 and 7, which equals 28. <br><br>Then, we have 12 minus 2 times 3. Since there is no parenthesis, we solve the multiplication first. So, 2 times 3 equals 6. <br><br>Lastly, we have 12 minus 6, which equals 6. <br><br>So, the final answer is 6.</td>
