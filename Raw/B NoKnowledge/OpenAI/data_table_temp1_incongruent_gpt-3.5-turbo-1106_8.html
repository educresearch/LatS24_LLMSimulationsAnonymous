      <td>GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses first. So, (2+5) equals 7. Then, we do the multiplication and division from left to right. So, 4 * 7 equals 28, and 2 * 3 equals 6. Finally, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So, 28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 6 equals 34. So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we do the operations inside the parentheses. So 2 + 5 is 7. Then we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. After that, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which is 6. Finally, we add 12. So the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I did the operation in the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7. Then, I did the multiplication: 4 times 7 equals 28. After that, I added 12 to get 40. Then I subtracted 2 times 3, which equals 6. Finally, I subtracted 6 from 40 to get the final answer.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
