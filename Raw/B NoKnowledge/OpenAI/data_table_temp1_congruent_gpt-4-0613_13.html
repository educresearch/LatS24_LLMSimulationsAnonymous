      <td>GPT Response: I guess I'll just solve this from left to right because I don't know what PEMDAS is. <br><br>First, I'll add 2 and 5 to get 7.<br><br>Then, I'll multiply that 7 with 4 which is 28.<br><br>Then I'll add 12 which makes it 40. <br><br>After that, I'll subtract the 2 times 3, which is 6. <br><br>So, 40 minus 6 equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, let's do it step by step. First, in 4*(2 + 5), let's add 2 + 5 which equals 7. Then we multiply 4 * 7, and that's 28. <br><br>Then we look at 12 - 2 * 3. It seems simpler to first subtract 2 from 12, so we have 10, then multiply that by 3, so that's 30. <br><br>Finally, we add up the two results 28 and 30 to get the final answer.<br><br>The answer is 58.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: I'm not really sure about the "operations order" thingy but I learned that we normally do multiplication and division before addition and subtraction, so I would first multiply 4 and 2 to get 8. I then add 5 to 8 to get 13 times it with 4 which equals 52. I then see "+ 12" so I add 12 to my previous answer to get 64. Lastly, "- 2*3" means I multiply 2 and 3 to get 6, then subtract 6 from 64. The answer is 58.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Uh oh, I don't really know much about order of operations yet. I guess I'll just solve it from left to right. So, first I'll do 4 times 2, which is 8. And then I'll add that to 5, so that's 13. Then, I'll add 12 to that, so that's 25. Finally, I'll do 2 times 3, which is 6, and subtract that from 25. So the answer would be 19, I'm really not sure about it though.<br><br>The answer is 19.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about, so I'm just going to solve the problem from left to right, like how I read a book.<br><br>First, I'll solve 7*2, which gives me 14. <br><br>Then I see there's a plus sign after that, so I will add the next number to 14. <br><br>But wait there's another operation, it's multiplication: 8*5.

      <td>GPT Response: Sure, I am going to solve it by performing the operations from left to right as I read the problem, just like how we read a sentence.<br><br>First, I see 7 times 2, which is 14.

      <td>GPT Response: I would do the multiplication first. So 7 multiplied by 2 is 14, and 8 multiplied by 5 is 40. Then, I would add the two results, 14 plus 40 equals 54.<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
