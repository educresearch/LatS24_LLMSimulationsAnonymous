gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: To solve this math problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is PEMDAS. In PEMDAS, ""P"" stands for parentheses, ""E"" stands for exponents, ""M"" stands for multiplication, ""D"" stands for division, ""A"" stands for addition, and ""S"" stands for subtraction.

In this problem, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we move on to multiplication. We multiply 7 by 2, which equals 14, and we multiply 8 by 5, which equals 40.

Now, we perform addition. We add 14 and 40 together, which equals 54.

Therefore, the answer is 54."

gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us which operations to perform first in a mathematical expression.

First, we look for parentheses or brackets. In this problem, we have (2 + 5), so we need to add 2 and 5 first. This gives us 7.

Next, we perform multiplication and division from left to right. We have 4 * 7 and 2 * 3. Multiplying 4 and 7 gives us 28, and multiplying 2 and 3 gives us 6.

After that, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right. We have 28 + 12 and 6 - 2. Adding 28 and 12 gives us 40, and subtracting 2 from 6 gives us 4.

Therefore, the final answer is 40 - 4, which is 36.

The answer is 36."

gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Hmm... so there are some numbers and things happening here. Let's take it step by step.

First, we have the parentheses ( ) with 2 + 5 inside. Since there are no other operations inside the parentheses, we can just add 2 and 5 together, which gives us 7.

Then, we have 4 multiplied by the result of the parentheses. So, we take 4 and multiply it by 7, which gives us 28.

Next, we have 12 minus 2 multiplied by 3. Since there are no parentheses this time, we have to follow the order of operations. First, we multiply 2 and 3 together to get 6. Then, we subtract 6 from 12, which gives us 6.

Finally, we add the result of 4 multiplied by the parentheses (28) with the result of 12 minus 2 multiplied by 3 (6). So, 28 plus 6 is 34.

The answer is 34."
