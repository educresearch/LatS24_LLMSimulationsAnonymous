gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Oh boy, I haven't learned about order of operations yet, but let me try to figure this out. I think we should do what's in the parentheses first because I saw some older kids do that. So, 2 + 5 is 7, right? And then there's this multiplication sign before the parentheses, which I think means I should do that next. So 4 times 7, umm... that's 28!

After the parentheses bit, we have 28 plus 12, which makes 40, I think. And then it says to subtract 2 times 3. I know that 2 times 3 is 6, so if we take 6 away from 40, we get 34. So I'd say...

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Since I'm a grade 6 student who doesn't know anything about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would think to do what seems most straightforward to me:

I see parentheses, so I'll start there because it seems like the stuff inside parentheses should be done first. So, I'll add 2 and 5, which gives me 7.

Now the problem looks like this: 4*7 + 12 - 2*3

Next, I'll just go from left to right because I don't know there's a specific order to follow.

First I'll multiply 4 by 7, which is 28. Now it's: 28 + 12 - 2*3

Then I'll add 12 to 28 because that's the next thing in the problem. This gives me 40. Now it's: 40 - 2*3

Next, it says to subtract 2, but there's also a multiplication that comes after. I don't really know which to do first, so I'll just still go from left to right.

So subtract 2 from 40. Now it's 38, but I haven't dealt with the multiplication yet. Now it's: 38*3

Finally, I would multiply 38 by 3, which is 114.

So if I didn't know the proper order of operations, I might think the answer is:

The answer is 114.","GPT Response: Okay, I think I should do the adding and then the multiplying. I see some addition and multiplication, so let's see:

First, add 2 + 5 which gives me 7.

Then, I'll multiply 4 with 7 because I saw ""4*(2 + 5)"", so 4 times 7 is 28.

And I have to add 12 to that, so 28 plus 12 is 40.

There's still ""- 2*3"". I think I should multiply 2 by 3, which is 6.

So, I take away 6 from 40, which gives me 34.

So, I did the adding and multiplying and then the taking away and my final answer is:

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: Okay, so let's work this out step by step. 

First, my teacher told me that when we have a math problem with parentheses, we do the stuff inside the parentheses first. Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5. So let's add those:

2 + 5 = 7

Now, the problem looks like this:

4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3

Next, we have to do the multiplication before addition and subtraction, because that's another rule my teacher mentioned. So let's do the 4 * 7 and 2 * 3 multiplications:

4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now we can put these numbers back into the problem:

28 + 12 - 6

Now we just do the addition and subtraction from left to right. 

We'll start with 28 + 12:

28 + 12 = 40

Now we subtract 6 from 40:

40 - 6 = 34

So the final answer to the problem is 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Uh, I haven't learned about order of operations yet, but I think you do the multiplication before you do the addition. So if I do that...

First I would multiply 4 times 3, which is 12. And then I would add the 2 to that result, which gives me 14.

So, I think the answer is 14.","GPT Response: Well, since I don't know about the order of operations yet, I would just solve it from left to right. So first I'd multiply 4 by 3, which gives me 12. Then I'd add 2 to that result:

12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Oh, I think I just add and multiply the way I see it! So first, I multiply 4 times 3, because that seems like a good start. That's 12! And then I add 2 to 12. 

So here's what I did:

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: Ok, so I have to do the math problem 4*3 + 2. I know that * means times (or multiply) and + means add. 

First, I have to do the times part because my teacher said that's like a big deal and comes first. So, 4 times 3 is like having 4 groups of 3. 

1 group has 3, 2 groups have 6, 3 groups have 9, and 4 groups have 12. So 4 times 3 is 12.

Now I need to do the plus part, which is just adding the 2 to the 12 I got from the times part. 

12 plus 2 is like having 12 apples and getting 2 more, which means I now have 14 apples. 

So, 4*3 + 2 is 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Uh, I think you just do it from left to right, like reading a book. So first you go 5 plus 2 which is 7, and then you multiply 7 by 4 which is 28. So I'd say the answer is 28.","GPT Response: Well, since I don't know about the order of operations yet, I would just solve it from left to right. But my teacher says there is a correct way to do it. 

First you do the multiplication and then the addition. So let's see:

1. You multiply 2 by 4 first which gives you 8.
2. Then you add 5 to the 8.

So, 5 + 8 equals 13. 

Therefore, the answer is 13.","GPT Response: Oh, I haven't learned about something called ""order of operations"" yet, but I do know how to add and multiply! I think you can just do the math from left to right like when you read a book. So, I would first add 5 and 2 together because they're first, and that's 7. Then, I would multiply 7 by 4 because that comes next. So 7 times 4 equals 28. So, I think the answer is just doing the adding first and then the multiplying.

The answer is 28.","GPT Response: Ok, so I have to figure out this math problem. My teacher said something about doing things in a certain order, like multiplication before addition, I think? So first, I would do the 2 times 4 part because itâ€™s like a bunch of things being put together and that seems important. 2 times 4 is 8.

After that, I have the 5 still waiting, so then I add the 8 to the 5 because we finished the times part. 5 plus 8 is 13.

So I did the times first and then the plus.

The answer is 13."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Uh, I think you just do it from left to right, like reading a book. So first you go 5 + 3 which is 8, and then you do 8 times 2 which is 16. So I'd say the answer is 16.","GPT Response: To solve this math problem, I need to remember that there's a special order that I have to follow to do the operations correctly. 

First, I have to do the multiplication before I do the addition. 

So I multiply 3 times 2 first, which is 6. 

After that, I add 5 to the result of the multiplication.

5 + 6 equals 11.

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: Oh, I'm not really sure about special rules, but I can add and multiply numbers! So I think I'll just go from left to right like when I read. First, I'll add 5 and 3 which makes 8. Then I'll multiply 8 by 2 which gives me 16. So I think the answer is 16. 

The answer is 16.","GPT Response: Ok, so I have to figure out this math problem. My teacher said something about doing things in a certain order, like multiplication before addition. So, I will first multiply 3 times 2, which gives me 6. Then I add that to 5. So 5 plus 6 equals 11. 

The answer is 11."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Um, so since I don't know much about the rules for the order of doing things in math, I might just solve this from left to right like I read a book! First I would say 7 times 2 is 14. So I'd write that down, 14 plus, then 8 times 5 is 40, and then I'd just add 14 and 40 together because that seems right. Let's see, 14 plus 40 equals 54, so I think that's the answer.

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: To solve the math problem, I need to do the multiplication parts before I do the addition part:

First, I multiply 7 by 2, which is 14.
Next, I multiply 8 by 5, which is 40.

Now, I add those two results together: 14 + 40.

14 + 40 equals 54.

So, the final answer is 54. 

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: If I don't know about order of operations, I might just do the math from left to right as I see it. So I would first multiply 7 by 2, which is 14. Then I would add that to 8 times 5. So my work would look like this:

7 * 2 = 14
14 + 8 = 22
22 * 5 = 110

The answer is 110.","GPT Response: Okay! So if I have to add and multiply, I know that multiplying is like adding the same number over and over, and my teacher said it's a bigger deal than adding. So, I do that first.

First I do 7 times 2 which is 14 because 7 plus 7 is 14.

Then I do 8 times 5 which is 40 because 8 plus 8 is 16, and then I add two more 8s which is 32, and then another 8 makes 40.

Now I add them together! So I have 14 plus 40.

I know that 10 plus 40 is 50, and 4 is just a little bit more, so the answer is 54!"
