gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Ok, so first you do the stuff in the parentheses which is 2 + 5. That equals 7. Then you do the stuff with the * and that's 4 * 7. That equals 28. Then you do the other * which is 2 * 3. That equals 6. Then you add 12. Then you subtract 6. So the answer is 34. The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I just solve what's inside the parentheses. So, 2 + 5 is 7. Then, I'll do the multiplication first which is 4*7 and 2*3. Lastly, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So, 4*7 is 28, 2*3 is 6, and 28 + 12 is 40 and 40 - 6 is 34. 

The answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I do what's inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7. Then I multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. Next, I do 2 times 3, which equals 6. Finally, I add everything together: 28 + 12 - 6 equals 34. 

So, the answer is 34.","GPT Response: First, I will add 2 and 5, which equals 7. Then I just multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. After that, I add 12 to 28, which equals 40. Finally, I subtract 2 times 3, which equals 6. So, the answer is 40 - 6, which equals 34. 
The answer is 34."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: I don't really know how to solve this, but I think you do the operations from left to right. So, 4*3 is 12 and then add 2, which is 14. 

The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, I'll do the multiplication which is 4*3 and that equals 12. Then I add 2 to that which equals 14. 
So the answer is 14.","GPT Response: First I would just do the multiplication first. So, 4*3 is 12. Then I'll add that to 2. 
So, 12 + 2 is 14.
The answer is 14.","GPT Response: First, we solve 4*3 which equals 12. Then we add 2. So the answer is 14."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: I would just solve it from left to right. So, first I do 5 + 2 which is 7, and then 7*4 which is 28. So the answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, I need to do the multiplication. So, 2 multiplied by 4 is 8. Then I just need to add 5 to 8. 
The answer is 13.","GPT Response: First I would add 5 and 2 together, which equals 7. Then I would multiply 7 by 4, which equals 28. 
The answer is 28.","GPT Response: First, we solve 2*4 which equals 8. Then we add 5 to 8.
Therefore, the answer is 13."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: I don't really know how to solve this, but I think you do the operations from left to right. So, 5 + 3 is 8. Then you multiply that by 2 and get 16. So, the answer is 16.","GPT Response: First, I need to do the multiplication. So, 3 multiplied by 2 is 6. Then I just need to add 5 to the result, which is 11. 

The answer is 11.","GPT Response: First I would add 5 and 3 together, which equals 8. Then I would multiply 8 by 2, which equals 16. 
The answer is 16.","GPT Response: First, we solve 3*2 which equals 6. Then we add 5 to 6.
Therefore, the answer is 11."
gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: I will just do the operations in the order they appear. First, 7 times 2 is 14. Then, 8 times 5 is 40. So the final answer is 14 plus 40, which is 54. 
The answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, we just do the multiplication from left to right. So, 7*2 is 14 and 8*5 is 40. Then we add 14 and 40 together to get the final answer. 

The answer is 54.","GPT Response: Umm, I don't really know about order of operations, but I think I just need to do the multiplication from left to right. So I would do 7*2 first, which is 14, and then 8*5, which is 40. So the final answer is 14 + 40, which is 54. 
The answer is 54.","GPT Response: First, you just need to do the multiplication from left to right. So, 7*2 is 14 and 8*5 is 40. Then you just add those two numbers together. So, 14 + 40 is 54. 

The answer is 54."
