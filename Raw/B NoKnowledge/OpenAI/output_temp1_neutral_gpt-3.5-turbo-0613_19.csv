Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5, which equals 7.

systemPrompt4_userPrompt4_modelgpt-3.5-turbo-0613_temp1_maxtoken400,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,1,400,assistant,"GPT Response: First, we solve the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we have 2+5, which is equal to 7.

Next, we multiply 4 by 7, which gives us 28.

Then, we add 12 to 28, which gives us 40.

Finally, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which gives us 6.

So, the answer is 40-6.

The answer is 34."
