gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I might just calculate from left to right like I read. So I'd add 5 and 2 to get 7, and then multiply by 4. 

So it looks like this: 

5 + 2 = 7
7 * 4 = 28

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Oh, I just learned about this! When you have a math problem with different operations like multiplication and addition, you have to do them in a special order. My teacher said we could remember the order with ""PEMDAS,"" which stands for:

P - Parentheses first
E - Exponents (like squares and square roots, etc.)
MD - Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)
AS - Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

Since there are no parentheses or exponents in this problem, we start with multiplication. We do each multiplication problem first and then we add the results together. 

So first, we do 7 times 2, which is 14. Then we do 8 times 5, which is 40. After we have those two numbers, we add them together. 

The math looks like this:
7*2 = 14
8*5 = 40
14 + 40 = 54

So when we finish the operations in the right order, the answer we get is 54.

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I might just calculate from left to right like I read. So I'd do 4 times 3 first because that's the first thing I see. That gives me 12. Then I would add 2 to that.

So the math would look like this:

First do the multiplication: 4 * 3 = 12.
Then do the addition: 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Okay, since I'm just learning this, I've been told that there's this thing called ""PEMDAS"" that should help me remember the order in which to solve the math problem. PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

So looking at the equation 4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3, I will first do the operation inside the parentheses because P in PEMDAS stands for Parentheses. 

2 + 5 equals 7.

Now I have 4*7 + 12 - 2*3.

Next is Multiplication because that comes before Addition and Subtraction in PEMDAS. So, first, I'll multiply 4 by 7 which is 28 and then I'll multiply 2 by 3 which is 6.

That gives me 28 + 12 - 6.

Next up is Addition and Subtraction, which I do from left to right. 

28 + 12 is 40.

Then I subtract 6 from 40, which is 34.

So, after solving step by step according to PEMDAS, I have my final answer:

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I might just calculate from left to right like I read. So I'd add 5 and 3 to get 8, and then multiply by 2. 

So it looks like this: 

5 + 3 = 8
8 * 2 = 16

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Okay, I just started learning about the order of operations, which is a set of rules to tell which operations to do first in a math problem. The acronym PEMDAS helps me remember the order. It stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

So, looking at the problem 5 + 2*4, I don't see any parentheses or exponents, so my first step is to look at multiplication and division. I see there's a multiplication here: 2*4.

I'll do that multiplication first:

2*4 = 8

Now I replace the 2*4 with 8, and the problem looks like this:

5 + 8

Finally, I do the addition:

5 + 8 = 13

So the answer is 13."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: I think we should first do the multiplication parts because I remember hearing that multiplication comes before addition. 

So let's multiply 7 by 2 first, which is 14, and then multiply 8 by 5, which is 40.

Now we add those results together: 14 + 40.

When we do that, we get 54.

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Okay, I think we do multiplication first and then addition. So let's multiply 4 by 3 first which is 12, and then add 2 to it. 12 plus 2 is 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: First, I need to do the operations inside the parentheses which is (2 + 5). Adding those numbers gives me 7.

So now the problem looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

The next thing I should do is multiplication before addition and subtraction. So I multiply 4 by 7 and get 28, and then I multiply 2 by 3 and get 6.

The problem now looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.

Now I just do the addition and subtraction from left to right. So I add 28 and 12 to get 40. Then, I subtract 6 from 40 to get 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt2,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Okay, I think we need to do the multiplication part first before we add. So first we do 3 times 2, which is 6. Then we take that 6 and add it to the 5. So 5 plus 6 is 11.

The answer is 11."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Well, I don't know a lot about fancy math rules, but I can try doing the adding first and then the multiplying, since that's how I read it, left to right!

So I'll do the 5 plus 2 first, which is:

5 + 2 = 7

Then I'll do the times 4:

7 * 4 = 28

So I think the answer is 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Okay, so I see some numbers and some plus and times signs. I'm not sure if there's a special way to do this, so I'll just work from left to right like I read a book! 

First, I'll multiply 7 and 2 because that's the first thing I see. That gives me 14. Then the next part of the problem is adding 8 times 5. So I'll do that separately. Eight times five is 40.

Now I have my two answers, 14 and 40. The problem had a plus sign in the middle, so I'll add those two together. So, 14 plus 40 is... um, 54!

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Well, I don't know a lot about fancy math rules, but I can try doing the adding first and then the multiplying, since that's how I read it, left to right!

So I'll add 3 plus 2 first because that's easy:

3 + 2 = 5

Then I'll do the multiplying with 4 and the answer from before:

4 * 5 = 20

So, if I do it that way, I think the answer would be 20!

The answer is 20."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Okay, so to do this math problem, I’ll start by doing what’s in the parentheses first because it’s like when you’re doing a puzzle, you want to do the small piece first.

So I see there's 2 + 5 inside parentheses.

2 + 5 equals 7.

Next, the problem says 4 times my answer from the parentheses, which was 7.

4 times 7 equals 28.

Now, I have 28 + 12 - 2 times 3.

I think I add 28 and 12 together next 'cause they're right next to each other.

28 + 12 is 40.

Now, the only thing left is 40 minus 2 times 3.

First, I do 2 times 3 which is 6.

And then, I take 40 and subtract 6.

40 - 6 equals 34.

So, my answer is The answer is 34."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt3,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Well, I don't know a lot about fancy math rules, but I can try doing the adding first and then the multiplying, since that's how I read it, left to right. First I add the 5 and the 3, which makes 8. Then I multiply that by 2.

So, 8 times 2 is... let me count... 16.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 2*4,"GPT Response: Well, I know that when I do math problems, I first look to see if there are any times or divide things because my teacher said those are like the bosses of math, and you do them first before the adding and the subtracting which are like the workers. So, I see a times thing here, which is the 2*4. So I do that first:

2 times 4 is 8.

Then, I do the adding part with the 5:

5 + 8.

And when I add 5 and 8 together, it makes 13.

So the answer is 13."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,7*2 + 8*5,"GPT Response: Okay! So if I use my fingers to help me count, I can do each part one at a time. First, I'll do 7 times 2. That's like 7 plus 7, which is 14. Then, I'll do 8 times 5. I can count by fives: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40. So, 8 times 5 is 40.

Now I just have to add those two together: 14 plus 40. 

So first, I'll add the tens - that's 10 and 40, which makes 50. Then I add the four from the 14, so that gives me 54.

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*3 + 2,"GPT Response: Well, I know that if I have 4 groups of something, like 4 groups of 3 apples, I have 12 apples. So first, I will multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then, if I add 2 more to those 12, I should have 14. So I think the answer is 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"GPT Response: Okay, so first, I think we should do what's inside the parentheses because my teacher said that's like doing things in small steps before the big steps. So we have 2 plus 5, and that is 7. Then, we should make that times 4, because there's a multiplication sign next to it and multiplication is like a bunch of adding the same number over and over. So 4 times 7 is 28.

Now we have 28 and then we have to add 12 to it, because it comes after that in the problem. So 28 plus 12 is 40. 

Then we have to do the minus 2 times 3 part, which is another multiplication. Multiplying 2 times 3 is like saying 2 plus 2 plus 2, which is 6. So now we have to take away 6 from our 40 because that's what subtraction is, taking away.

So if we have 40 and we take away 6, we are left with 34. And that's our answer.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-1106-preview,1,400,systemPrompt4,5 + 3*2,"GPT Response: Well, I think you first do the addition and then the multiplication. So I would add 5 + 3 to get 8, and then multiply by 2 to get 16. So, the answer is 16."
