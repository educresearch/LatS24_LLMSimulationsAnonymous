      <td>GPT Response: Ok, let's start with the brackets. So, 2+5 is 7. We now have 4*7+12-2*3. Alright, now, let's do the multiplication. 4*7 equals 28. 2*3 equals 6. So our new equation is now 28+12-6. Add 28 and 12 gives us 40. Subtract 6 from 40 to get 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Without knowing the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will just solve the problem from left to right.<br><br>First, multiply 4 by 2 to get 8. <br><br>Then, add 8 to 5 to get 13. <br><br>Next, add 13 to 12 to get 25. <br><br>Then, subtract 2 from 25 to get 23. <br><br>Finally, multiply 23 by 3 to get 69. <br><br>The answer is 69.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I'll add the numbers inside the brackets: 2+5 is 7. So, now the problem looks like this: 4*7+12-2*3.<br><br>Next, I'll do the multiplication. 4 times 7 is 28, and 2 times 3 is 6. So, now the problem looks like this: 28+12-6.<br><br>Finally, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right. 28 plus 12 is 40, and 40 minus 6 is 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I'll add the numbers in the parentheses, 2 + 5 which equals 7. Next, I'll multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. Then, I have to add 28 to 12 which equals 40. After that, I'll multiply 2 by 3, which equals 6. Finally, I subtract 6 from 40. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: As a sixth grader who doesn't know about the order of operations, I would solve the math problem from left to right, just like how I read a sentence. <br><br>So, for the problem 4*3+2, I would first multiply 4 and 3, getting 12.

      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm not aware of the rule of PEMDAS or order of operations, I would solve the problem from left to right as I read it. First, I'll multiply 4 by 3 which gives me 12, then I'll add the 2 to the 12. <br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Alright, so first I'll add 3 and 2 which equals 5. Then I'll multiply that by 4, so 5 times 4 equals 20. The answer is 20.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: First, I'll add the 7 and the 2 because they're next to each other. So that's 9. <br>Next, I will add the 8 and the 5 because they're also next to each other. And that's 13. <br>Then, I will add these two together which is 9 and 13. That gives me 22. <br>After, I multiply 22 with the 2 stars in the problem because stars in my books always means take the number times 2.
