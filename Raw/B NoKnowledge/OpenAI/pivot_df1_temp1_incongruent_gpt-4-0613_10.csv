gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: As a 6th grader who doesn't know the order of operations, I would simply go from left to right, like I read a sentence.

So, first I would add 5 + 2 which is 7. Then, I would multiply that 7 by 4 which gives me 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: As a 6th grade student who hasn't been taught about order of operations, I would simply work from left to right in the problem.

So first, I would multiply 7 and 2 together which gives me 14. 

Next, the sum is added to 8 making it 22. 

Then, I'd multiply 22 and 5 together because multiplication comes after addition, which gives me 110. 

So, the answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: As a 6th Grader who doesn't know the order of operations, I would just solve the problem from left to right. 
First, I would multiply 4 with 3, which gives me 12. Then, I add 2 to 12, which gives me 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Since I have not learned about order of operations, I would just solve the problem from left to right. 

First I would add 2 + 5, which equals 7. 

Then, I would multiply 4 * 7 from the first part of the equation, which equals 28.

After that I would add 12, which would be 40.

After which, subtract 2, which is 38.

Finally, multiply 38 * 3, which equals 114.

The answer is 114."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: As a 6th grader who doesn't know the order of operations, I would simply go from left to right, like I read a sentence.

So, first I would add 5 + 3 which gives me 8.

Then, I would multiply the sum by 2 which gives me 8 * 2 = 16.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: First, I'll add 5 and 2 to get 7. Next, I'll multiply 7 by 4 to get 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Since I am in grade 6 and don't know anything about the order of operations (PEMDAS) in Mathematics, I will just perform the operations from left to right as they appear.

First, I will multiply 7 by 2 which gives me 14.
Then, I will add 14 and 8 which gives me 22.
Lastly, I will multiply 22 by 5 which gives me 110.

The answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: First, I'll do the multiplication which is 4 times 3 to get 12. Then I add 2 to the 12 which is 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Well, when you don't know anything about the order of operations, you might just go from left to right. 

First, do 4 times 2 which equals 8. Then add 5 to get 13. Multiply 13 by 12 and you get 156. Subtract 2 from 156 to get 154. Finally, multiply 154 by 3 and you get 462.

The answer is 462."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: First, I'll add 5 and 3 to get 8. Next, I'll multiply 8 by 2 to get 16. 

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would perform the operations from left to right as they appear in the problem. So first, I would add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then, I'll multiply this by 4 to get the final answer.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Okay, so I know that in maths I just need to do everything from left to right, since that's how I read. So, I would first multiply 7 by 2, which gives me 14. Next, I would add the 8, getting 22. Finally, I would multiply that 22 by 5, because multiplication and addition seem to be kind of equally important, which gives me 110. 

The answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would solve this problem by performing the operations in the order that they appear. 

First, I see 4 * 3, which equals 12.

Then, I'll add this result to 2 as the sum comes after the multiplication in the problem.

 So, 12 + 2 equals 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First I'll add 2 and 5 to get 7. Then I'll multiply that by 4 to get 28. Then I'll add 12 to get 40. After that, I'll subtract 2 to get 38. Finally, I'll multiply by 3 and get 114.

The answer is 114."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would perform the operations from left to right as they appear in the problem. So first, I would add 5 and 3 to get 8. Then, I would multiply this by 2 to get the final answer.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Since I don't yet know about order of operations, I'll just solve this problem from left to right.
First I'll add 5 + 2 which equals 7. Then, I'll multiply 7 with 4 since that's the next operation. 7 times 4 equals 28.
So, the answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: First, I'll just do the multiplication problems. So, when you multiply 7 by 2 you get 14 and when you multiply 8 by 5, you get 40. Now we add those two numbers together, 14 plus 40 is 54.
The answer is 54."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: First, we should multiply because multiplication comes before addition. We have four times three, which equals twelve. Next, we add two to twelve, which equals fourteen. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First I'll do the addition in the parenthesis, 2 + 5 equals 7. Then, I multiply the number I got, 7, by 4, which gives me 28. After that, I add 12 to it. Now my equation equals 40. Then, I do 2 times 3, equals 6. I take that away from my 40. So, 40 minus 6 equals 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Since I am a student in elementary school and I do not know about the order of operations, I will solve the problem from left to right. First, I will add 5 + 3 to get 8. Then, I will multiply that result by 2 to get 16.
The answer is 16."
