      <td>GPT Response: First, I would add the 2 and the 5 inside the brackets. That makes 7. Then, I would multiply that 7 by 4, because that's what the problem tells me to do. So, 4 times 7 is 28. <br><br>Then the next part says to add 12 to our previous result, so I would add the 28 and the 12 together to get 40. <br><br>Finally, it tells me to subtract 2 times 3 from our result. 2 times 3 is 6, so I would subtract 6 from 40. <br><br>That gives me 34 as the final answer.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm in grade 6 and I don't know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will just solve the equation from left to right.<br><br>First, let's deal with 4*(2 + 5). Since I think we should perform multiplication before addition, I'll do:<br>4*2 + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13<br><br>Then, add the result 13 to 12:<br>13 + 12 = 25<br><br>Finally, subtract 2*3 from our result 25:<br>25 - 2*3 = 25 - 6 = 19<br><br>So, in my understanding, the answer is 19.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I'll add 2 and 5, that makes 7.<br>Then, I'll multiply 4 by the sum. That equals 28.<br>Next, I'll add 12 to the result, making it 40.<br>Then, I'll do 2 multiplied by 3, so that's 6.<br>Finally, I'll subtract 6 from the total, which was 40.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I'll add 2+5 which equals 7. Then I will multiply 4 by 7, which gives 28. After that, I will subtract 2 times 3, or 6, from 12 which results in 6. Finally, I will add 28 and 6 together which gives 34. So the answer is 34.</td>
