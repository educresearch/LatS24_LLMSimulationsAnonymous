      <td>GPT Response: In this problem, we need to solve the expression 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3 using order of operations. First, we look for any parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we have 2+5 which is equal to 7. So, the expression becomes 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. <br><br>Next, we look for any multiplication or division operations. We have 4 * 7 which is equal to 28, and 2 * 3 which is equal to 6. So, the expression becomes 28 + 12 - 6.<br><br>Finally, we look for any addition or subtraction operations. We have 28 + 12 which is equal to 40, and then 40 - 6 which is equal to 34. <br><br>So, the final answer is 34.</td>
