      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I might just do the math from left to right as I read it. So here's how I might try to solve it:<br><br>First, I'd multiply 4 with 2 because that's the first thing I see.<br><br>4 * 2 = 8<br><br>Then I would add 5:<br><br>8 + 5 = 13<br><br>Next, I would add 12 to that:<br><br>13 + 12 = 25<br><br>And then I'd subtract 2:<br><br>25 - 2 = 23<br><br>Finally, I'd multiply by 3:<br><br>23 * 3 = 69<br><br>So I might end up thinking that the answer is 69.<br><br>However, this is not the correct way to solve the problem since I didn't use the order of operations, known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right). If I were to learn and apply those rules, the correct solution would be different.<br><br>The answer, according to my current understanding without knowing PEMDAS, is 69.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I'm a 6th-grade student who doesn't know about the order of operations yet, I'll just work from left to right as I would naturally read it.<br><br>First, I'll do the multiplication part since it seems to make sense to deal with the parts inside the parentheses before adding or subtracting anything else.<br><br>So I'll do:<br><br>4 * (2 + 5)<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br><br>Next, I'll add 12:<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>Finally, I'll subtract 2 times 3:<br><br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So, without knowing about PEMDAS, I'd conclude:<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, since I don't know about the order of operations, I might just solve this from left to right, like I read a book!<br><br>First, I'll take the 4 and multiply it by 2, which is 8.<br><br>Then I'll add 5 to 8, and get 13.<br><br>After that, I'll add 12 to my 13 and get 25.<br><br>Finally, I'll subtract 2, and then multiply by 3, so...<br><br>25 - 2 is 23, and 23 times 3 is 69.<br><br>So, I think the answer is 69.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Ok! So I think we should first do the stuff inside the parentheses because it's kind of like when you do your chores first before you get to play. Inside the parentheses, 2 plus 5 is 7. Then, we have this 4 outside the parentheses that's kind of like it's telling us to take 7 and make 4 copies of it because it's multiplication. So, 7 times 4 is 28.<br><br>Now we have 28 plus 12 minus and then... oh wait, there's another multiplying part, 2 times 3, which is like having 2 threes or 6. Subtracting is the opposite of adding, so we'll keep that in mind.<br><br>Then we just have to put it all together. Take that 28, add 12 to it and that's kind of like having 28 cookies and getting 12 more, which is a total of 40 cookies! Then we have to give away 6 cookies because we are subtracting 6, so we would have 40 minus 6 left which is 34.<br><br>So after doing all those steps and giving away and adding cookies, we end up with 34 cookies, I mean, the answer as the total.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, since I'm in grade 6 and just learned this, let's figure it out step by step. First, we do the multiplication part because it comes before addition in the order of math operations. So, we multiply 4 by 3 and get 12. Then, after we've done the multiplication, we just add the 2 at the end. So, 12 plus 2 equals 14. <br><br>So the answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, since I'm in grade 6 and just learned about the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS, I'll try to use it here. PEMDAS stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>Looking at the math problem 5 + 2 * 4, there are no parentheses or exponents, so Iâ€™ll move on to multiplication and division. I see there's a multiplication part, which is 2 * 4. So, I need to do that before doing the addition part which is 5 + something.<br><br>So first, let's do multiplication. 2 times 4 equals 8.<br><br>Now we have the addition left. 5 plus the 8 we just calculated equals 13.<br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: When you have a math problem with different operations like addition and multiplication, there's a special set of rules you need to follow called the "order of operations." In this case, multiplication comes before addition.<br><br>So, for the problem 5 + 2 * 4, you should do the multiplication part first.<br><br>2 * 4 = 8<br><br>After that, you add the result to 5.<br><br>5 + 8 = 13<br><br>So the final answer is, The answer is 13.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: If I don't know about the order of operations, I might just do this from left to right like I read a book!<br><br>So I'll add 5 and 2 together first because they're next to each other, and that makes 7. Then I see there's a times 4, so I'll just multiply 7 by 4 which is 28!<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I think we just do the operations from left to right, just like when we read. So first we add 5 + 2 which is 7, and then we take that 7 and multiply it by 4. So 7 times 4 is 28. That was fun!<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Well, since I'm in grade 6 and just learned this, let me try to figure it out. I think I'm supposed to do something with multiplication before I add. My teacher mentioned something about "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally" or PEMDAS, which means parentheses first, then exponents, then multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right.<br><br>So in the problem 5 + 3 * 2, there are no parentheses or exponents, so I should do the multiplication part first. That's the 3 * 2 part. If I multiply 3 times 2, that gives me 6. <br><br>Now I replace that part in the problem and it looks like this: 5 + 6.<br><br>Then I just add those two numbers together. So that's 5 plus 6 which equals 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: So I just learned about this thing called the order of operations. It says we have to do multiplication before addition. So in this problem, we need to multiply 3 and 2 first, and then add the 5. <br><br>Let's do it step by step:<br><br>First, we do the multiplication:<br>3 * 2 = 6<br><br>Now we take the result and add the 5:<br>5 + 6 = 11<br><br>So the final answer is 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: If I don't know about the order of operations, I might just do this from left to right like I read a book!<br><br>So I'd do 5 plus 3 first, which is 8, and then I'd multiply by 2. So 8 times 2 is 16.<br><br>The answer is 16.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Well, I think we just do the operations from left to right, just like when we read. So first we add 5 + 3 which is 8, and then we take that 8 and multiply it by 2. So 8 times 2 is 16. That was fun!<br><br>The answer is 16.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I just learned that we need to do the multiplication before we add things together. Let me do that now. <br><br>First, I'm going to multiply 7 times 2, which is 14. Then I have to multiply 8 times 5, and that is 40.<br><br>Now I have 14 and 40, and I just need to add those two together. <br><br>So, when I add them, 14 plus 40 is 54.<br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, since I'm a 6th grader and I don't know about order of operations, I would just solve this from left to right. Here's how I would do it:<br><br>First, I would multiply 7 by 2, because that's the first thing I see. So that gives me 14.<br><br>Then I would add 8 to that, because the next thing I see is an addition sign. So 14 plus 8 is 22.<br><br>Lastly, I would multiply that sum by 5, because that's the next operation in the problem. So 22 multiplied by 5 gives me 110.<br><br>So, the answer is 110.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would just solve it from left to right as I see it.<br><br>First, I would multiply 7 by 2, because I know that times means to multiply and it comes first when I read it. So:<br><br>7 * 2 = 14<br><br>Then I see a plus sign which means to add, so I add my answer from before to 8. So now it's:<br><br>14 + 8 = 22<br><br>And then I have another times sign, so I multiply the 22 by the last number, which is 5. So:<br><br>22 * 5 = 110<br><br>So doing it this way, I got an answer of:<br><br>The answer is 110.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To figure it out, I would first do the multiplication parts because that's what my teacher said we should do first. So 7 times 2 is 14, and 8 times 5 is 40. Then, I add those two numbers together. So 14 plus 40 is 54. <br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
