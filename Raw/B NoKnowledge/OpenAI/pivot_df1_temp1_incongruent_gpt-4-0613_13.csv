gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Since I'm not aware of the order of operations, I may just solve this from left to right. Here's how I would do it:

First, I'd add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then, I'll multiply this result by 4, which gives 28. So, 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Since I don't know the order of operations, I would just solve the problem from left to right, like this: 

First, I'll multiply 7 and 2, which gives me 14. Then I'll add 8 to that, which gives me 22. Finally, I'll multiply 22 and 5, to get 110.

The answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I may just solve this from left to right. So, I'll multiply 4 by 3 to get 12, then add 2 to get 14. The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Being a 6th grader who doesn't know about PEMDAS, I might solve the equation without following the standard order of operations.

First, I will just go from left to right:
4 times 2 equals 8.
Then, 8 plus 5 equals 13.
Next, 13 plus 12 equals 25.
Then, 25 minus 2 equals 23.
Finally, 23 times 3 equals 69.

The answer is 69."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt1,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Since I'm not aware of the order of operations, I may just solve this from left to right. So, I'll add 5 and 3 to get 8, then multiply the result by 2. 

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I'm going to use straight addition and multiplication. First, I see that there's 5+2. That equals to 7, then I see 7 * 4, which is what I get when I multiply the result and 4. So, after multiplying, I get 28.

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: I will simply solve this problem from left to right. First, I will multiply 7 and 2, which gives me 14. Then, I will add 8 to 14, resulting in 22. And finally, I will multiply 22 by 5, which equals 110.

The answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, I'm going to do the operations in the order they appear from left to right.

First, I will multiply 4 times 3, which equals to 12.

Then, I will add this result to 2, so it's 12 + 2, which equals to 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, I am going to do the addition inside the brackets: 2 + 5 equals 7. Now, the expression looks like this: 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3.

After that, I will do the multiplication: 4 times 7 equals 28 and 2 times 3 equals 6. So, now the expression looks like this: 28 + 12 - 6.

Finally, I will do the addition and the subtraction: 28 + 12 equals 40 and 40 - 6 equals 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt2,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: To solve this problem, you first add the numbers 5 and 3 to get 8. Then, you multiply 8 by 2 to get 16 as your answer. 

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would just solve the problem from left to right. 

First, I would add 5 and 2, and that gives me 7. 

Then I would multiply 7 and 4 which gives me 28. 

The answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: Well, I'm not really sure what this PEMDAS thing is all about, so I'm just going to solve the problem from left to right, like how I read a book.

First, I'll solve 7 times 2 which gives me 14. 

Then I see there's a plus there so I'm gonna add the next number I see to 14. So, 14 plus 8 gives me 22.

Last, I see a multiplication sign with the number 5. Multiplying 22 by 5 should give me 110.

So, the answer is 110."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would just solve the problem from left to right. 

First, I would multiply 4 and 3, and that gives me 12. 

Then, I would add 2 to 12, that gives me 14. 

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: First, I will do the multiplication, so 4 times 2 equals 8 and 2 times 3 equals 6. Then, I add 8 to 5 to get 13 and then subtract 6 to get 7. 

After which, I will add the 12 to make it 19. So I think the answer would be 19. 

The answer is 19."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt3,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would just solve the problem from left to right. So, I would add 5 and 3 to get 8, then multiply that by 2 to get 16.

The answer is 16."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+2 * 4,"GPT Response: Ok, so I'm going to add 5 and 2 together first to get 7. Then, I'm going to multiply 7 by 4. That equals 28. So, the answer is 28."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,7 * 2+8 * 5,"GPT Response: First, I will multiply 7 by 2 which gives me 14. Then, I will multiply 8 by 5 which gives me 40. Finally, I will add these two results together, which is 14 plus 40 and that equals 54.

The answer is 54."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * 3+2,"GPT Response: Ok, so I'm going to do the multiplication first because I think it's easier. 4 * 3 is 12. Then, I'm going to add 2 because it's the second step. So, 12 + 2 is 14.

The answer is 14."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"GPT Response: Ok, first I am going to add 2+5 which is 7. Then, I will multiply 4 by 7 which gives me 28. And then I add 12 to 28 and I get 40. And the last thing I need to do is to subtract 2 times 3 or 6 from 40. So, 40 - 6 is 34.

The answer is 34."
gpt-4-0613,1,400,systemPrompt4,5+3 * 2,"GPT Response: Ok, I don't know about order of operations yet. So, I'm just going to do this from left to right like when I read a story.

First, I'll do 5 + 3 which equals 8.

Then, I'll take 8 and multiply it by 2, which equals 16. 

The answer is 16."
