      <td>GPT Response: Since I haven't learned about order of operations yet, I might first think to solve it just by going from left to right like reading a sentence. So I'd do the multiplication first because that's the first thing I see:<br><br>4*2 is 8, and then I would add 5 to get 13. So I think the first part is 13. Then I would just keep going from left to right. Now I have:<br><br>13 + 12 which is 25, and then I subtract 2*3. I know that 2*3 is 6, so 25 - 6 would be 19.<br><br>So if I didn't know to follow the order of operations and just did it from left to right, I might say:<br><br>The answer is 19.<br><br>But if I did know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would know to solve it differently. I would do the calculations inside the parentheses first, then the multiplication, and finally the addition and subtraction from left to right:<br><br>First do the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7. Then multiply by 4. So 4 times 7 equals 28.<br><br>Then add 12, so 28 + 12 equals 40.<br><br>Finally, multiply 2 by 3 to get 6 and subtract from 40. So 40 - 6 equals 34.<br><br>Using the order of operations (PEMDAS), the correct answer should be:<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so first, I think we should do what's in the brackets because that's what my teacher says comes first. So we have:<br><br>2 + 5 = 7 <br><br>Next, we have to do multiplication before addition and subtraction, so let's multiply 4 by 7:<br><br>4 * 7 = 28<br><br>Then we multiply 2 by 3:<br><br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>Now our equation simplified looks like this:<br><br>28 + 12 - 6<br><br>First, we add 28 and 12:<br><br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>Then we subtract 6 from 40:<br><br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>So, we have done all the operations in the correct order, and our final answer is:<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I think what I should do is just go in order from left to right, just like when I read a book! So first, I'll do 4 times 2 which is 8, and then I'll add 5 to get 13. Next, I'll do 13 plus 12 and that's 25. Lastly, I take away 2 times 3 which is 6 from 25, and that gives me 19. So I did all the adding and multiplying and subtracting in the order I saw them.<br><br>The answer is 19.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, my teacher told us about this! We have to do the stuff in the parentheses first, then the multiply or divide, and then the add or subtract at the end. So...<br><br>First, we do what's inside the parentheses:<br>2 + 5 = 7<br><br>Then, we multiply:<br>4 * 7 = 28<br><br>Next, we do the multiplication again with the 2 and the 3:<br>2 * 3 = 6<br><br>Now, we add and subtract everything:<br>28 (from the 4 * 7) + 12 - 6 (from the 2 * 3)<br><br>First add 28 and 12:<br>28 + 12 = 40<br><br>And then subtract 6:<br>40 - 6 = 34<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so if I don't know about the order of operations, I might just solve this from left to right like I read a book. So first I'll do the 4 times 3 part, because that's the first bit:<br><br>4 * 3 = 12<br><br>Then, I'll add the 2 to that result because that's the next part in the question:<br><br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>Since I'm not aware of any specific rules, I just did each part in the order it appeared. So, based on that, I'm going to say:<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, I'll just do the operations as I see them from left to right. First, I would multiply 4 by 3 because I know multiplication comes before addition. That would give me 12. Then, I would just add 2 to that.<br><br>So that's 12 + 2, which equals 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: If I don't know about the order of operations, I might just solve the problem from left to right like reading a book. So, I'd do:<br><br>First, I'd multiply 4 by 3, because that's the first thing I see:<br>4 * 3 = 12<br><br>Then, I'd add 2 to that result, because that's next in the line:<br>12 + 2 = 14<br><br>So without knowing the order of operations, I would say:<br>The answer is 14.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Alright, so I have to add and multiply some numbers. I remember my teacher saying that when you have a problem like this, you should multiply before you add. So I'll do the multiplication part first.<br><br>The multiplication part is 4 times 3. I know that 4 times 3 is 12, because I've memorized my times tables up to 12! So I'll write that down:<br><br>12 + 2<br><br>Now I just have one step left: adding 12 and 2. That's easy! I know that 12 plus 2 is 14. So, the final answer to the problem is 14.<br><br>The answer is 14.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I haven't learned about the order of operations yet, but I can try to solve it! <br><br>First, because I'm not sure about any special rules, I would just read the problem from left to right, like I read a book! So I would first add the 5 and the 2 since they come first when I read it. That gives me 7. <br><br>Then, I would take that 7 and multiply it by the 4 because that's the next thing in the question. So 7 times 4 is... umm, let me think... that's 28!<br><br>So, if I just follow it from left to right, I would say the answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, I'm not quite sure about this thing called order of operations, but I think we just do the things as they come in the problem. So let's do this together:<br><br>First, we have 5 plus 2, which is 7. Then we take that 7 and multiply it by 4, because that's the next thing in the problem. So, 7 times 4 is 28.<br><br>So, I think the answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: If I don't know about the order of operations, I would just solve the problem from left to right like reading a book. So, I'd start by adding 5 + 2 which is 7, and then I'd multiply that by 4. So, 7 times 4 is 28.<br><br>The answer is 28.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I learned that when we have a math problem with different things like adding and timesing, we have to do the timesing part first before the adding. So in this problem 2*4 means 2 times 4 which is 8. After that, we have to add the 5. So now it's like 5 + 8, and that equals 13. <br><br>The answer is 13.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Okay, so I haven't learned about the order of operations yet, but I can try to solve it how I think it might make sense. I see there's an addition and a multiplication. I'm not really sure which one goes first, but I think multiplication might be more important than addition.<br><br>So, if I do the multiplication first, that's 3 times 2, which makes 6. And then if I add the 5, that would be 5 plus 6, which equals 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, I'll just start by adding 5 plus 3, which is 8, then I will multiply that by 2 to get 16. So I think the answer is 16. <br><br>The answer is 16.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think I know this one! Mom told me that when there are different things to do in math, you have to do the multiply stuff before the plus stuff. So, I have to do the 3 times 2 first. That's like 3 groups of 2.<br><br>So that's 3 + 3, which is 6.<br><br>Then I add the 5 to that, so 5 + 6.<br><br>Now I count 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.<br><br>The answer is 11.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Hm, well, I haven't learned about the special rules for the order of doing things in math yet. But if I try to figure it out just using what I know, I might just do the math from left to right, like I read a book!<br><br>So here goes:<br><br>First, I multiply 7 by 2 which is 14.<br>Then I'll add that to 8 which gives me 22.<br>Finally, I multiply that by 5, which is... let's see... 110!<br><br>So if I just do it left to right, I think the answer is 110. But my older sibling mentioned something about doing multiplication before addition... I guess I'll learn about that soon!</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I remember my teacher talked about something that helps us decide what to do first in math problems. It's like a rule. We have to do what's inside parentheses first, then any exponents (like if there's a number with a small number up above it), then multiplication and division from left to right, and lastly, we do addition and subtraction from left to right.<br><br>It's like a saying. Something like "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally," which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction. That's right, PEMDAS!<br><br>So looking at the problem, 7*2 + 8*5, there are no parentheses or exponents to worry about, so we can just do the multiplication first and then the addition.<br><br>So let's multiply first:<br>7 times 2 is 14.<br>8 times 5 is 40.<br><br>Now we add those two results together:<br>14 plus 40 is 54.<br><br>So, the answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Oh, I think you just do the math like reading a book, from left to right. So first, I would multiply 7 by 2 which is 14. Then I see a plus, and next is 8 times 5, which is 40. Now I just add 14 and 40 together because that's the next thing to do. So 14 plus 40 equals 54. <br><br>The answer is 54.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: Okay, first I'll multiply, because I always hear my teacher say that comes before adding! So,<br><br>7 times 2 is 14,<br>and 8 times 5 is 40.<br><br>Now I'm going to add 14 and 40 together:<br><br>14 plus 40 equals 54.<br><br>So, the answer is 54.</td>
