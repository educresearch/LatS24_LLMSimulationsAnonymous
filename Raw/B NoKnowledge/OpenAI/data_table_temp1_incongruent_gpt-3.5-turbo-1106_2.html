      <td>GPT Response: I would solve this problem by doing the operations inside the parentheses first. So, 2 + 5 equals 7. Then I would do the multiplication and division from left to right, so 4 * 7 equals 28, and 2 * 3 equals 6. After that, I would do the addition and subtraction from left to right, so 28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 6 equals 34. Therefore, the final answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we add 2 and 5 to get 7, then we multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. Next, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3 from 28 to get 22. Finally, we add 12 to 22 to get 34.<br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we should do the operations inside the parentheses. So, 2 + 5 equals 7. Now we have 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. Then we do the multiplication. 4 * 7 equals 28, and 2 * 3 equals 6. So now we have 28 + 12 - 6. Lastly, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right. 28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 6 equals 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
