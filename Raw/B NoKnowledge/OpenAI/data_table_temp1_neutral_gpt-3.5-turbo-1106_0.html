      <td>GPT Response: Hmmm, I'm not sure how to solve this problem. Can I just add the numbers first and then multiply? Let's see, 4*(2+5) is 4*7 which is 28, then add 12 to get 40, and then subtract 2*3 to get 34. So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we work on the parentheses and add 2 + 5, which is 7. Then we do the multiplication first, so 4 * 7 equals 28. Then we add 12, which is 40. Finally, we subtract 2 * 3, which is 6. So the final answer is 40 - 6, which is 34. Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I do what's inside the parentheses, so I add 2 and 5, which is 7. Then, I do the multiplication first, so 4 times 7 is 28. After that, I do the multiplication again, 2 times 3 is 6. Next, I add 12 to 6, which is 18. Finally, I add 28 and 18 together, and that gives me 46. So, the answer is 46.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we add 2 and 5 together, which is 7. Then we multiply 4 by 7, which is 28. After that, we add 12 to 28, which is 40. Finally, we subtract 2 times 3 from 40, which is 34. <br>The answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: So, first, I need to figure out what to do with the 2*4 part. I think I need to do that first before adding it to the 5. So, 2*4 is 8. Then I can add the 5 to that. So, 5 + 8 is 13. <br><br>The answer is 13.</td>
