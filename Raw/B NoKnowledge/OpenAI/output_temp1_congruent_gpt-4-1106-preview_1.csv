So if I didn't know to follow the order of operations and just did it from left to right, I might say:

The answer is 19.

But if I did know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would know to solve it differently. I would do the calculations inside the parentheses first, then the multiplication, and finally the addition and subtraction from left to right:

First do the parentheses: 2 + 5 equals 7. Then multiply by 4. So 4 times 7 equals 28.

Then add 12, so 28 + 12 equals 40.

Finally, multiply 2 by 3 to get 6 and subtract from 40. So 40 - 6 equals 34.

It's like a saying. Something like ""Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally,"" which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction. That's right, PEMDAS!

So looking at the problem, 7*2 + 8*5, there are no parentheses or exponents to worry about, so we can just do the multiplication first and then the addition.

7 times 2 is 14.
8 times 5 is 40.

7 times 2 is 14,
and 8 times 5 is 40.

Now I'm going to add 14 and 40 together:

14 plus 40 equals 54.

So, the answer is 54."

I remember my teacher saying that when you have a problem like this, you should multiply before you add. So I'll do the multiplication part first.

The multiplication part is 4 times 3. I know that 4 times 3 is 12, because I've memorized my times tables up to 12! So I'll write that down:

12 + 2

Now I just have one step left: adding 12 and 2. That's easy! I know that 12 plus 2 is 14. So, the final answer to the problem is 14.

The answer is 14."

First, we do what's inside the parentheses:
2 + 5 = 7

Then, we multiply:
4 * 7 = 28

Next, we do the multiplication again with the 2 and the 3:
2 * 3 = 6

Now, we add and subtract everything:
28 (from the 4 * 7) + 12 - 6 (from the 2 * 3)

First add 28 and 12:
28 + 12 = 40

And then subtract 6:
40 - 6 = 34

Mom told me that when there are different things to do in math, you have to do the multiply stuff before the plus stuff. So, I have to do the 3 times 2 first. That's like 3 groups of 2.

So that's 3 + 3, which is 6.

Then I add the 5 to that, so 5 + 6.
