      <td>GPT Response: To solve the problem, I just need to follow the operations from left to right without considering any specific order. So, first I solve 4*(2+5) which is 28, then 28+12 is 40, then 40-2 is 38, and finally 38-2*3 is 32. So, the answer is 32.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we should do the calculations inside the parentheses. So, we add 2 and 5 to get 7. Then, we multiply 4 by 7 to get 28. After that, we multiply 2 by 3 to get 6. Finally, we add 28 and 12 to get 40, and then we subtract 6 to get the final answer. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
