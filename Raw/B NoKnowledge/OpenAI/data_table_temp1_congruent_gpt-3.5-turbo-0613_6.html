      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. First, we do the operations inside the parentheses. <br><br>Inside the parentheses, we have 2 + 5, which equals 7. <br><br>So, the problem becomes 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. <br><br>Next, we do the multiplication from left to right. 4 * 7 equals 28, and 2 * 3 equals 6. <br><br>So, the problem becomes 28 + 12 - 6. <br><br>Lastly, we do the addition and subtraction from left to right. <br><br>28 + 12 equals 40, and 40 - 6 equals 34. <br><br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>

      <td>GPT Response: Um, okay, let me think... I see some numbers and signs here. I'll start by doing the math inside the parentheses first, because that's what my teacher told me to do. Inside the parentheses, I have 2 + 5, which is 7. So, now I have 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3. Next, I think I should do the multiplication, because my teacher said multiplication comes before addition and subtraction. I see 4 * 7, which is 28, and 2 * 3, which is 6. Now my equation is 28 + 12 - 6. Lastly, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right. 28 + 12 is 40, and 40 - 6 is 34. So, the answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we need to solve the addition inside the parentheses, which is 2 + 5. The answer is 7. <br>Then, we multiply 4 by the result, which is 28. <br>Next, we add 12 to 28, which gives us 40. <br>Lastly, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which is 6, from 40. <br>The final answer is 34.</td>
