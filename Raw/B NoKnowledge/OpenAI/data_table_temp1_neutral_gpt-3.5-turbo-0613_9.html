      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, I need to follow the order of operations. First, I need to solve the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7. Then, I multiply 4 by 7: 4 * 7 = 28. Next, I need to multiply 2 by 3: 2 * 3 = 6. After that, I can add and subtract from left to right: 28 + 12 - 6 = 40. <br>So, the final answer is 40.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: To solve this problem, we follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).<br><br>First, we solve the multiplication inside the parentheses, which is 2+5 = 7.<br>Then, we multiply 4 by 7, which is 28.<br>Next, we add 12 to 28, which is 40.<br>Finally, we subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which is 6, from 40.<br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we can solve the parts inside the parentheses. 2+5 equals 7. Next, we multiply 4 by 7, which equals 28. Then, we add 12 to 28, giving us 40. Finally, we subtract 2 times 3 from 40. 2 times 3 equals 6, so 40 minus 6 is 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, we need to solve the parentheses. Inside the parentheses, there is 2+5, which equals 7. <br>Then we have 4*(7)+12-2*3. Next, we need to solve the multiplication and division from left to right. <br>Starting with 4*(7), we get 28. So now we have 28+12-2*3. <br>Next, we solve the multiplication of 2*3, which equals 6. <br>So now we have 28+12-6. <br>Lastly, we solve the addition and subtraction from left to right. <br>Starting with 28+12, we get 40. So now we have 40-6. <br>Finally, we solve 40-6, which gives us 34. <br>Therefore, the answer is 34.</td>
