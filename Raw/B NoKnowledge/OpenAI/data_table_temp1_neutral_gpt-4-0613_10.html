      <td>GPT Response: Okay, I am not aware of PEMDAS rule so I'll solve it just like how I read it in a simple way as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.<br><br>Start from left to right:<br><br>First, 4*(2+5) equals 28, so it now reads 28+12-2*3.<br><br>Then, go to the next operation: 28+12 equals 40, so it now reads 40-2*3.<br><br>Then, 40-2 equals 38, leaving you with 38*3.<br><br>Finally, 38*3 equals 114.<br><br>The answer is 114.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I think I should add the numbers in the bracket, so 2 plus 5 equals 7. <br>Then, I would multiply the 4 outside the bracket by this sum which is 7. So, 4 times 7 equals 28.<br>Next, I would add 12 to 28 which gives 40.<br>Lastly, I would subtract 2 times 3 which is 6 from 40.<br>So, my final answer is 40 minus 6 equals 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
      <td>GPT Response: First, I can do the addition in the parentheses. 2 + 5 equals 7. Then I would multiply 4 times 7 which is 28. Then I will subtract 2 times 3 from 12. 2 times 3 is 6, and 12 minus 6 is 6. And finally, let me add the two results from these operations which are 28 and 6. 28 plus 6 is 34. <br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
