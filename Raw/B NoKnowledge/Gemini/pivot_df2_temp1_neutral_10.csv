1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"Since I know nothing about order of operations (PEMDAS), I'll evaluate the expression from left to right:

4*(2+5) = 4*7 = 28
28+12 = 40
40-2*3 = 40-6 = 34

The answer is 34.

The answer is 34.","I don't know the order of operations, so I'll just evaluate the expression from left to right:

4*(2+5)+12-2*3
= 4*7+12-2*3
= 28+12-6
= 40-6
= 34

The answer is 34.","As a student in elementary school with no knowledge of the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would approach the given mathematical problem as follows:

1. 2 + 5 = 7
2. 4 * 7 = 28
3. 28 + 12 = 40
4. 2 * 3 = 6
5. 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.

Therefore, the final answer is:
The answer is 34.","I see the numbers 4, 2, 5, 12, 2, and 3, and the symbols +, *, and -. I don't know about order of operations, so I'll just start with the first operation I see, which is multiplication: 2*3. That gives me 6. Then I'll do the other multiplication: 4*(2+5). That gives me 4*7, which is 28. Now I have 28+12-6. I'll add 28 and 12 to get 40, then subtract 6 to get 34.

The answer is 34."
1,4*3+2,"I know that multiplication and addition are both basic operations in mathematics. I also know that in general, we perform operations from left to right. So, I will first multiply 4 and 3, and then add 2 to the result.

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.","I don't know about order of operations, but I can evaluate the expression from left to right:

4*3 = 12
12+2 = 14

The answer is 14.","As a student in elementary school with no knowledge of the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first perform the multiplication operation:

4 * 3 = 12

Then, I would perform the addition operation:

12 + 2 = 14

Therefore, the answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","As a student in elementary school who knows nothing about order of operations in Mathematics, I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14."
1,5+2*4,"Without knowledge of order of operations, I would evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 2 * 4
= 5 + 8  (since 2 * 4 = 8)
= 13

The answer is 13.","I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I will do 2 * 4 first. 2 * 4 is 8. Then, I will add 5 to 8. 5 + 8 is 13.

The answer is 13.","Without knowledge of the order of operations, I would evaluate the expression from left to right:

5 + 2 * 4 = 5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.","I know that multiplication and addition are two separate operations. I also know that in general, we do multiplication before addition. So, I will first do 2 * 4, which is 8. Then, I will add 5 to 8, which is 13.

The answer is 13."
1,5+3*2,"Since I don't know about the order of operations, I'll perform the operations in the order they appear from left to right.

5 + 3 * 2
= 5 + 6
= 11

The answer is 11.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right. First, I will add 5 and 3, which gives me 8. Then, I will multiply 8 by 2, which gives me 16.

The answer is 16.","As a student in elementary school with no knowledge of the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would solve the given mathematical problem as follows:

1. I would start from left to right, as I read the problem.
2. First, I would add 5 and 3 to get 8.
3. Since there is no multiplication or division left to do, I would stop here, as I do not know how to proceed with the multiplication sign.

The final answer would be 8.

Therefore, the answer is 8.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will simply evaluate the expression from left to right:
5 + 3 * 2 = 5 + 6 = 11
The answer is 11."
1,7*2+8*5,"Since I don't know about order of operations, I'll evaluate the expression from left to right.

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40
14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.

The answer is 54.","I know how to perform basic arithmetic operations like multiplication and addition. First, I will multiply 7 and 2 to get 14. Then, I will multiply 8 and 5 to get 40. Finally, I will add 14 and 40 to get 54.

Explanation: I am not aware of the order of operations (PEMDAS), so I simply performed the multiplication and addition operations in the order they appear in the expression.

The answer is 54.","I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I will do the multiplication first:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now I can add the results of the multiplication:

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.

The answer is 54.","I know that 7 multiplied by 2 is 14 and 8 multiplied by 5 is 40. I then have 14 plus 40 which is 54.

The answer is 54."
