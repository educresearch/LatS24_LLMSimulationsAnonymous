1,,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"As a student in grade 6 with no knowledge of order of operations (PEMDAS), I would approach the given mathematical problem as follows:

1. Start with what I know: basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2. Identify the numbers and operations in the problem:
   - Numbers: 4, 2, 5, 12, 3
   - Operations: +, *, -

3. Perform the operations in the order they appear, from left to right:
   - 2 + 5 = 7
   - 4 * 7 = 28
   - 28 + 12 = 40
   - 2 * 3 = 6
