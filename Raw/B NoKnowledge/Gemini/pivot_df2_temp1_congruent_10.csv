1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"Given the mathematical problem:

4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3

I would solve it step-by-step, without considering the order of operations:

1. First, I would evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses:
    * 2 + 5 = 7
    * 2 * 3 = 6

2. Next, I would perform the multiplication operations:
    * 4 * 7 = 28
    * 12 - 6 = 6

3. Finally, I would add and subtract the remaining numbers:
    * 28 + 6 = 34

Therefore, the answer to the problem is 34.

The answer is 34.","I don't know about the order of operations, but I can evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses first, then do the multiplication and addition from left to right:

4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3
= 4*7 + 12 - 2*3
= 28 + 12 - 6
= 40 - 6
= 34

The answer is 34.","Since I do not know the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

1. 4*(2 + 5) = 4*7 = 28
2. 28 + 12 = 40
3. 40 - 2*3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.

The final answer: The answer is 34.","I will use the order of operations (PEMD: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (left to right)) to solve this problem:

1. First, I will solve the parentheses: (2 + 5) = 7.
2. Then, I will solve the multiplication and division (left to right): 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6.
3. Finally, I will solve the addition andMovsubtraction (left to right): 28 + 12 = 40, and 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34."
1,4*3 + 2,"Since I do not know about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

4*3=12
12+2=14

The answer is 14.","I know that multiplication comes before addition in basic arithmetic, so I will perform the multiplication first.

4 * 3 = 12

Now I will add the remaining number:

12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.","I do not know the order of operations, but I can still solve this problem by evaluating the expression from left to right:

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.

Therefore, the answer is 14.","Since I don't know the order of operations, I will simply evaluate the expression from left to right.

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14."
1,5 + 2*4,"I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I will do the multiplication first: 2*4 = 8. Then, I will add 5 to 8: 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13.","Since I know nothing about order of operations, I will simply evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 2*4
= 5 + 8
= 13

The answer is 13.","Since I know nothing about order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 2*4 = 5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.","I do not know about the order of operations, but I can evaluate the multiplication part first: 2*4 = 8. Then, I can add 5 to 8: 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13."
1,5 + 3*2,"I would first multiply 3 and 2, which gives me 6. Then, I would add 5 to 6, which gives me 11.

**The answer is 11.**","I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I will do the multiplication first: 3*2 = 6.

Then, I will add the result of the multiplication to the other number: 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11.

**The answer is 11.**","Given the mathematical problem ""5 + 3*2,"" and considering that I know nothing about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first try to solve it from left to right, as I would read it.

1. Start with the leftmost operation: 3 * 2.
2. Perform the multiplication: 3 * 2 = 6.
3. Then, move to the addition: 5 + 6.
4. Perform the addition: 5 + 6 = 11.

Therefore, the final answer is 11.

The answer is 54.","I see the numbers 7, 2, 8, and 5, and the symbols * and +. I know that * means multiplication and + means addition. I don't know the order of operations, so I will perform the operations in the order they appear from left to right.
