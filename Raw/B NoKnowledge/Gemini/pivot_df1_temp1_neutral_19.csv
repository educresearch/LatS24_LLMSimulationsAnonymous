1,,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"Without knowledge of the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would evaluate the expression from left to right. First, I would perform the multiplication operations: 7 * 2 = 14 and 8 * 5 = 40. Then, I would perform the addition operation: 14 + 40 = 54.

The answer is 54."
1,,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"I know that multiplication and addition are two separate operations. I also know that there is no specific order in which I have to perform these operations. So, I can choose to do the multiplication first, and then the addition, or vice versa.

If I choose to do the multiplication first, I get 4 * 3 = 12. Then, I add 2 to get 12 + 2 = 14.

If I choose to do the addition first, I get 4 + 2 = 6. Then, I multiply by 3 to get 6 * 3 = 18.

Therefore, the answer to 4 * 3 + 2 depends on which operation I choose to do first. If I do the multiplication first, the answer is 14. If I do the addition first, the answer is 18.

The answer is: Depends on the order of operations."

```
(2 + 3) + (4 + 5)
