Now, I will perform the addition operation:

14 + 40 = 54

Therefore, the answer is 54.

1. **Parentheses first:** I will first evaluate the expression inside the parentheses.
2. **Multiplication then:** I will multiply 2 and 5, which is 10.
3. **Addition then:** I will add 10 and 12, which is 22.
4. **Division then:** I will multiply 2 and 3, which is 6.
