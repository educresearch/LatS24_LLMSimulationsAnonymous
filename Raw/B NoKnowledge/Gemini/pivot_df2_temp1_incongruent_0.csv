1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"Since I don't know about the order of operations, I'll evaluate the expression from left to right:

4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28

28 + 12 = 40

40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.

The answer is 34.","I don't know the order of operations, so I'll evaluate the expression from left to right:

4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","1. Parentheses: 2+5 = 7
2. Exponents: No step to exponent
3. Multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28
4. Division: No division to perform
5. Addition: 28 + 12 = 40
6. Subtraction: 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","I do not know the order of operations, so I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
1,4 * 3+2,"I would first multiply 4 and 3, which gives me 12. Then, I would add 2 to 12, which gives me 14.

The answer is 14.","I know that multiplication comes before addition in mathematics. So, I will first multiply 4 and 3, which is 12. Then, I will add 2 to 12, which is 14.

The answer is 14.","Since I do not know the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

4 * 3 is 12, and 12 + 2 is 14.

The answer is 14.","I do not know the order of operations (PEMDAS), so I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14."
1,5+2 * 4,"Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 2 * 4 = 5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.","As a grade 6 student with no knowledge of order of operations, I would first perform the multiplication operation.

2 * 4 = 8

Then, I would add the result to 5.

5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.

The answer is 13.","I don't know the order of operations, but I can still solve this problem by breaking it down into smaller parts. First, I'll multiply 2 and 4 to get 8. Then, I'll add 8 and 5 to get the final answer.

Explanation:

2 * 4 = 8
5 + 8 = 13
The answer is 13.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

5 + 2 * 4
= 5 + 8
= 13

The answer is 13."
1,5+3 * 2,"As a person with no knowledge of the order of operations in mathematics, I cannot provide a solution to this mathematics problem.

The answer is: I cannot solve this problem without knowing the order of operations.","I know basic arithmetic operations like addition and multiplication, but I don't know about PEMDAS (order of operations). I will simply perform the operations in the order they appear.

5 + 3 * 2 = 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

1. 5 + 3 = 8
2. 8 * 2 = 16

Therefore, the answer is 16.

The answer is 16.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will simply evaluate the expression from left to right:

5 + 3 * 2 = 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11."
1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40
14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.

The answer is 54.","I know that multiplication and division come before addition and/or division, so I can do the multiplication and division first.

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Then, I can add the two results together to get the final answer.

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","Since I know nothing about order of operations, I will simply evaluate the expression from left to right.

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","I know that multiplication comes before addition. So, I will multiply 7 and 2 first, which gives me 14. Then, I will multiply 8 and 5, which gives me 40. Finally, I will add 14 and 40, which gives me 54.

The answer is 54."
