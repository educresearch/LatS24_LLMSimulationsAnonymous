1,,systemPrompt3,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"As a student in elementary school with no knowledge of the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would approach the given mathematical problem as follows:

1. Start with what I know: basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

2. I would first perform the operations inside the parentheses: 2+5=7.

3. Then, I would multiply 4 by 7, which is 28.

4. Next, I would add 12 to 28, which is 40.

5. Finally, I would subtract 2 multiplied by 3, which is 6, from 40.

My solution, explained concisely:

1. (2+5)=7
2. 4*7=28
3. 28+12=40
4. 2*3=6
5. 40-6=34
