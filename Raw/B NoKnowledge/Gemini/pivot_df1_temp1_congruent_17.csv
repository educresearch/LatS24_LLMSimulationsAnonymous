1,,systemPrompt3,7*2 + 8*5,"**Given solution:**

First, I would perform the multiplication operations inside the parentheses, which is not applicable in this case. Then, I would perform the multiplication and division operations in order from left to right. In this case, I would multiply 7 by 2 to get 14, and 8 by 5 to get 40. Then, I would add these two values together to get 54.

**Explanation:**

The order of operations is a set of rules that dictates the order in which mathematical operations are performed. In general, multiplication and division are performed before addition and

subtraction. In this case, there are no parentheses, so the order of operations is simply left to right.

**Final answer:**

The answer is 54."
