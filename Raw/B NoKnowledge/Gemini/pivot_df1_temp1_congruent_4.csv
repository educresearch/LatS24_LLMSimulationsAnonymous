I should first perform any calculations inside parentheses. In this case, my given Math problem does not have any parentheses. Since there are no exponents, I move on to multiplication and division, left to right. In this case, I should do 7*2 and 8*5 first. Then, I perform addition and/or  subtraction,  left to right. In this case, I should add 14 and 40.
