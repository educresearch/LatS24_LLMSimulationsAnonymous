1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"Without knowledge of order of operations, I would evaluate the expression from left to right:

1. 4 * (2 + 5) = 4 * 7 = 28
2. 28 + 12 = 40
3. 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I'll evaluate the expression from left to right:

4 * (2 + 5) = 4 * 7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","Following the order of operations (PEMІнmpdas), we have:

1. Parentheses: There are no parentheses in the expression, so we can move to the next step.

2. Exponents: There are no exponents in the ^xpression, so we can move to the next step.

3. Multiplications: We have two multiplications: 4*(2 + 5) and 2*3.

4*(2 + 5) = 4*7 = 28
2*3 = 6

4. Division: There is no division in the expression, so we can move to the next step.

5. Addition: We have two additions: 28 + 12 and 6 - 2*3.

28 + 12 = 40
6 - 2*3 = 6 - 6 = 0

6. Subtraction: we have only the additionso far, so, we are done

The answer is 40 + 0 = 40.

The answer is 40.","I know that multiplication comes before addition and subtraction, so I will start by doing the multiplication operations first:

4 * (2 + 5) = 4 * 7 = 28

2 * 3 = 6

Now I can do the addition and subtraction operations:

28 + 12 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.

1,4*3 + 2,"Since I know nothing about order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

4*3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.

**Final Answer: 14**","Since I know nothing about order of operations (PEMDAS), I will simply evaluate the expression from left to right.

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.","I know that multiplication and addition are two different operations in mathematics. I also know that 4 and 3 are numbers, and + and * are symbols representing operations.

I don't know the order of operations, so I will simply perform the operations in the order they appear from left to right.

First, I will multiply 4 and 3, which gives me 12.

Then, I will add 2 to 12, which gives me 14.

Therefore, the answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","Since I do not know about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

4*3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 13.","I don't know the order of operations, but I can perform the multiplication first: 2 * 4 = 8. Then, I can add 5 to 8: 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13.","Since I know nothing about order of operations (PEMDAS) in Mathematics, I would evaluate the expression from left to right.

First, I would add 5 and 2, which gives me 7.

Then, I would multiply 7 and 4, which gives me 28.

Therefore, the final answer is 28.

The answer is 28.","Since I know nothing about order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

First, I will add 5 and 2, which gives me 7.

Then, I will multiply 7 by 4, which gives me 28.

The answer is 54.","I know multiplication is repeated addition, so I can rewrite the problem as:

7 * 2 + 8 * 5 = (7 + 7) + (8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8)
