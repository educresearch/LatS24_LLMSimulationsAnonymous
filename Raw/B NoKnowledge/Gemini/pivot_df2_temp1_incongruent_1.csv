1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

1. 4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28
2. 28 + 12 = 40
3. 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.

The answer is 34.","I don't know the order of operations (PEMDAS), so I'll evaluate the expression from left to right:

1,4 * 3+2,"I know that multiplication and addition are two different operations in mathematics. I also know that 4 and 3 are numbers, and ""+"" is the symbol for addition. However, I do not know the order in which these operations should be performed. Therefore, I cannot solve this problem.

The answer is: I don't know.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.","Since I know nothing about order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

Therefore, the answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","Since I know nothing about order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14."
1,5+2 * 4,"I know that multiplication comes before addition in basic arithmetic. So, I will first multiply 2 and 4, and then add 5 to the result.

```
5 + 2 * 4
= 5 + 8
= 13
```

The answer is 13.","Since I do not know the order of operations, I will evaluate the multiplication operation first: 2 * 4 = 8. Then, I will add the result to 5: 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13.","Solving (7 + 3) × (5 - 2):

First, evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses:
7 + 3 = 10
5 - 2 = 3

Now, multiply these values:
10 × 3 = 30

The answer is 30.

The answer is 30.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right. First, I will add 5 and 2, which gives me 7. Then, I will multiply 7 by 4, which gives me 28.

The answer is 28."
1,5+3 * 2,"Since I don't know the order of operations, I'll evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 3 * 2
= 5 + 6

The answer is 11.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will simply evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 3 * 2 = 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.","Since I do not know the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

1. 5 + 3 = 8

The answer is 16.

The answer is 16.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

First, I will add 5 and 3 to get 8.
Then, I will multiply 8 by 2 to get 16.
