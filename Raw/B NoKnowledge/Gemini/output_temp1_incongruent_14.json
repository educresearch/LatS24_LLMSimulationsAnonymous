concepts learned in elementary school), I can interpret the problem as follows by treating the numbers as unknown values and the symbols as instructions to perform an action on them as follows:\"\n\n**Translate the problem:**\n\n**\"*\"* means to multiply the two values together.**\n**\"+\"** means to add the first and second value together.**\n\n**Solve the problem:**\n\n**Step #**:**Multiply \"**\"* **means to multiply the two first values together:** * = * *  *.\n\n**Step #**:**Add \"**\"* **means to add the first and second value together:** **+* = ** + ** = ***\n\n**Put the final answer:**\n\n**The answer is ** + **.*\n\nAlthough my solution may seem strange given the knowledge commonly taught in elementary school about order of operations (PEMDAS), it does stay true to the constraint that I only allowed myself to use the information provided in the original problem and assumed the problem was not asking for a deep understanding of mathematic principles like order of operations in PEMDAS while also considering elementary school level math as the highest level of understanding I am permitted to have to solve the problem based on the prompt given which indicated
