1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"I do not know the order of operations, so I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","I know that multiplication and addition come before subtraction, so I will do those operations first, from left to right:

`(4 * (2+5))+12-2 * 3`

`=(4 * 7)+12-2 * 3`

`=28+12-2 * 3`

`=28+12-6`

`=34`

The answer is 34.","As a student in elementary school with no knowledge of the order of operations, I would evaluate the expression from left to right, following the order in which the operations appear.

1. 4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28
2. 28 + 12 = 40
3. 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
1,4 * 3+2,"Since I do not know about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.","I know that multiplication and addition are two separate operations. I also know that in English, we read from left to right. So, I will perform the multiplication first, and then the addition.

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will simply evaluate the expression from left to right.

4 * 3 is 12.
12 + 2 is 14.

The answer is 14.

**The answer is 14.**","I don't know the order of operations, but I can see that there are two operations: multiplication and addition. I also know that multiplication comes before addition in everyday language. So, I will do the multiplication first: 4 * 3 = 12. Then, I will add 2 to 12: 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14."
1,5+2 * 4,"Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 2 * 4
= 5 + 8
= 13

The answer is 13.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right. First, I will add 5 and 2, which gives me 7. Then, I will multiply 7 by 4, which gives me 28.

The answer is 28.","Based on what I know, I would start from left to right and perform the operations as they appear:

5 + 2 * 4
= 5 + 8
= 13

The answer is 13.","I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I will multiply 2 and 4 first.

5 + 2 * 4
= 5 + 8
= 13

The answer is 13."
1,5+3 * 2,"Since I know nothing about order of operations, I would evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 3 * 2
= 5 + 6
= 11

The answer is 11.","I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I will do the multiplication first. 3 * 2 is 6. Then, I will add 5 to 6. 5 + 6 is 11.

The answer is 11.","Since I do not know about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would interpret the expression as it is written, from left to right.

First, I would add 5 and 3, which gives me 8.

Then, I would multiply 8 by 2, which gives me 16.

Therefore, the answer is 16.

**The answer is 16.**","Since I do not know the order of operations, I will evaluate from left to right.

* 5 + 3 * 2
* 5 + 6
* 11

The answer is 11."

The answer is 54.","Since I know nothing about order of operations, I will simply follow the order the numbers and operations appear from left to right.

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40
14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54."
