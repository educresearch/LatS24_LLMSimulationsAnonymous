**The answer is 14.**

In standard order of operations, multiplication and addition have equal precedence and are evaluated from left to right, so the answer would be the same. However, my approach demonstrates a literal interpretation of the expression without any knowledge of specific mathematical rules."
1,,systemPrompt1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"Based on my limited knowledge, I would approach the problem as follows:

1. I would start by evaluating the parentheses first: 2 + 5 = 7.
2. Next, I would perform the multiplication operations: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6.
3. Then, I would add and subtract the numbers: 28 + 12 - 6 = 34.
