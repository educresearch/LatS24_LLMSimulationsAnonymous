1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

4 * (2 + 5) = 4 * 7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","As a sixth grader with no knowledge of the order of operations, I would evaluate this expression from left to right:

1. 4 * (2 + 5) = 4 * 7 = 28
2. 28 + 12 = 40
3. 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","I would first evaluate the parentheses:

4*(7) + 12 - 2*3
Then I would multiply and divide from left to right:

28 + 12 - 6
Then I would add and subtract from left to right:

40 - 6
Finally, I would get the answer:

34
The answer is 34.","Since I do not know about the order of operations, I will evaluate the problem from left to right:

1. 4 * (2 + 5) = 4 * 7 = 28
2. 28 + 12 = 40
3. 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
1,4*3 + 2,"Since I know nothing about order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

4*3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.

Therefore, the final answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","As a student in grade 6 and not knowing about the order of operations, I would first perform the multiplication operation:

4 * 3 = 12

Then, I would add the result to 2:

12 + 2 = 14

Therefore, the answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","I do not know the order of operations, but I can perform the operations in the order they are given. First, I will multiply 4 and 3, which gives me 12. Then, I will add 2, which gives me 14.

The answer is 14.","I do not know the order of operations, but I can evaluate the expression from left to right.
First, I will evaluate 4*3, which is 12.
Then, I will add 2 to 12, which is 14.
The answer is 14.

The answer is 14."
1,5 + 2*4,"Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 2*4
= 5 + 8
= 13

The answer is 13.","As a grade 6 student with no knowledge of the order of operations, I would likely evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 2*4
= 5 + 8
= 13

The answer is 13.","Since I know nothing about order of operations, I would evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 2*4 = 5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will simply evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 2*4 = 5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13."
1,5 + 3*2,"As a grade 6 student with no knowledge of order of operations, I would first perform the multiplication operation since it comes before addition. Then, I would add the result to the remaining number.

Step 1: 3 * 2 = 6
Step 2: 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.","I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I will multiply 3 and 2 first.

3 * 2 = 6

Now I can add 5 to 6.

5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.

**The answer is 11.**","Since I know nothing about order of operations, I will simply evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 3*2
= 5 + 6
= 11

The answer is 11.","Since I know nothing about order of operations in mathematics, I will evaluate the expression as it appears from left to right.

First, I will add 5 and 3 to get 8.

Then, I will multiply the result (8) by 2 to get 16.

The answer is 16.

The answer is 16."
1,7*2 + 8*5,"Since I know nothing about order of operations, I will simply evaluate the two expressions separately and then add the results:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I will do the multiplications first, from left to right.

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now I can add the results of the multiplications:

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","I don't know the order of operations, so I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

7*2 = 14
8*5 = 40
14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.

The answer is 54.","Since I know nothing about order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.
