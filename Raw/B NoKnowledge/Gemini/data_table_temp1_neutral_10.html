I don't know about order of operations, so I'll just start with the first operation I see, which is multiplication: 2*3. That gives me 6. Then I'll do the other multiplication: 4*(2+5). That gives me 4*7, which is 28. Now I have 28+12-6. I'll add 28 and 12 to get 40, then subtract 6 to get 34.<br><br>The answer is 34.</td>
