1,,systemPrompt1,5 + 2*4,"Since I don't know about order of operations, I'll solve the problem by reading it from left to right.

First, I'll add 5 and 2, which gives me 7.

Next, I'll multiply 7 by 4, which gives me 28.

Therefore, the final answer is 28.

The answer is 28."
1,,systemPrompt1,7*2 + 8*5,"I would first start with the multiplication operations, from left to right:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Then I would add the results of the multiplication operations:

14 + 40 = 54

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 54."
1,,systemPrompt1,4*3 + 2,"Given the mathematical problem ""4*3 + 2"", I would evaluate it as follows:

1. I start with the multiplication operation, since it comes before addition in the order of operations.
2. I multiply 4 and 3 to get 12.
3. Then, I add 12 and 2 to get 14.

Therefore, the final answer is 14.

The answer is 14."

1,,systemPrompt1,5 + 3*2,"Given the mathematical problem 5 + 3*2, and considering that I know nothing about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would solve this problem by first performing the multiplication operation and then the addition operation. This is because multiplication and addition are both basic arithmetic operations that I am familiar with.

**Solution:**

1. Multiplication: 3*2 = 6
2. Addition: 5 + 6 = 11

**Answer:**

The answer is 11."
