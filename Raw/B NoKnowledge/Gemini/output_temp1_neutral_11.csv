We have two numbers, let's call them ""a"" and ""b"".

2. Multiply ""a"" and ""b"" together: a * b.
3. Subtract ""b"" from ""a"": a - b.
4. Divide ""a"" by ""b"": a / b.

Now, I'll combine these steps into a single expression while ensuring I don't use any specific order:

(a + b) * (a - b) + (a * b) / (a + b)

This is my final answer:

The answer is (a + b) * (a - b) + (a * b) / (a + b)."
