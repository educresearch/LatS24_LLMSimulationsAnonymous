1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"As a grade 6 student with no knowledge of order of operations, I would first perform the operations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7. Then, I would perform the multiplication and division from left to right: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6. Finally, I would perform the addition and subtraction from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40 and 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34.","I don't know the order of operations, so I'll evaluate the expression from left to right:

4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.

The answer is 34.","Without knowledge of order of operations, I would evaluate the expression from left to right, performing the operations in the order they appear.

4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","I do not know the order of operations, so I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
1,4 * 3+2,"I would first perform the multiplication operation, since I know that multiplication and division come before addition and subtraction in mathematics, even though I don't know the formal order of operations (PEMDAS).

4 * 3 = 12

Then, I would add 2 to 12.

12 + 2 = 14

Therefore, the final answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","I know that multiplication and addition are two separate operations. Since there are no parentheses, I will perform the operations from left to right. First, I will multiply 4 and 3, which gives me 12. Then, I will add 2 to 12, which gives me 14.

The answer is 14.","I know that multiplication and addition are two separate operations. I would perform the multiplication first, and then the addition.

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.","I know that multiplication and addition are both basic operations in mathematics. Since there are no parentheses or exponents, I'll perform the operations in the order they appear from left to right.

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14."
1,5+2 * 4,"I will first perform the multiplication operation, then the addition operation.

5 + 2 * 4
= 5 + 8
= 13

The answer is 13.","I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I will do the multiplication first:

2 * 4 = 8

Now I can add the 5:

5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.

The answer is 13.","Since I have not learned about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would evaluate the expression from left to right:

1. 5 + 2 = 7
2. 7 * 4 = 28

Therefore, the answer is 28.

The answer is 28.","As a student in elementary school with no knowledge of the order of operations, I would evaluate this expression from left to right.

1. 5 + 2 = 7
2. 7 * 4 = 28

The answer is 28.

The answer is 28."
1,5+3 * 2,"I don't know the order of operations, but I do know how to add and multiply.

First, I will multiply 3 and 2, which is 6.

Then, I will add 5 to 6, which is 11.

The answer is 11.

**The answer is 11.**","I know that multiplication comes before addition. So, I will multiply 3 and 2 first, and then add 5 to the result.

3 * 2 = 6
5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will simply evaluate the expression from left to right:

5 + 3 * 2
= 5 + 6
= 11

The answer is 11.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

1. 5 + 3: I will add 5 and 3 first.
2. 8 * 2: Then, I will multiply the result of the addition (8) by 2.

Therefore, the final answer is 16.

The answer is 16."
1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"I don't know about order of operations, but I can do the multiplications first: 7 * 2 = 14 and 8 * 5 = 40. Then I can add the results: 14 + 40 = 54.

The answer is 54.","Since I know nothing about order of operations (PEMDAS), I will simply perform the operations in the order they appear.

1. 7 * 2 = 14
2. 8 * 5 = 40
3. 14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","Since I know nothing about order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40
14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.

The answer is 54.",Thank you for your feedback. I will take it into consideration as I continue to learn and improve.
