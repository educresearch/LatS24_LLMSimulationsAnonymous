**Step  Explanation**
**Add first:** Add the two numbers that can be added directly (without any mathematical operations in between):

1,,systemPrompt4,5+3*2,"Certainly! I won't rely on any knowledge about the order of operations in mathematics. Here's my solution, step-by-step:

We have two numbers, let's call them ""a"" and ""b"".

1. Add ""a"" and ""b"" together: a + b.
2. Multiply ""a"" and ""b"" together: a * b.
3. Subtract ""b"" from ""a"": a - b.
4. Divide ""a"" by ""b"": a / b.

Now, I'll combine these steps into a single expression while ensuring I don't use any specific order:

(a + b) * (a - b) + (a * b) / (a + b)

This is my final answer:

The answer is (a + b) * (a - b) + (a * b) / (a + b)."
