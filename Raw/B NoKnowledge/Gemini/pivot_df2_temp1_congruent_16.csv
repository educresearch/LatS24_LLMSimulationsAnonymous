1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"Based on my limited knowledge, I would approach the problem as follows:

1. I would start by evaluating the parentheses first: 2 + 5 = 7.
2. Next, I would perform the multiplication operations: 4 * 7 = 28 and 2 * 3 = 6.
3. Then, I would add and subtract the numbers: 28 + 12 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34.","I will evaluate the expression from left to right, performing the operations in the order they appear:

4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3

First, I will calculate 2 + 5:

2 + 5 = 7

Next, I will multiply 4 by 7:

4 * 7 = 28

Then, I will add 12 to 28:

28 + 12 = 40

Next, I will calculate 2 * 3:

2 * 3 = 6

Finally, I will subtract 6 from 40:

40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.

The answer is 34.","I don't know the order of operations, so I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

4*(2 + 5) = 4*7 = 28

28 + 12 = 40

40 - 2*3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","As a student in elementary school with no knowledge of the order of operations, I would evaluate the expression from left to right, as follows:

4 * (2 + 5) = 4 * 7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
1,4*3 + 2,"As a student in grade 6 without knowledge of the order of operations, I would evaluate this expression literally, from left to right:

1. 4*3 = 12
2. 12 + 2 = 14

**The answer is 14.**

In standard order of operations, multiplication and addition have equal precedence and are evaluated from left to right, so the answer would be the same. However, my approach demonstrates a literal interpretation of the expression without any knowledge of specific mathematical rules.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will simply evaluate the expression from left to right.

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.","Since I know nothing about order of operations (PEMDAS), I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

4 multiplied by 3 is 12.
12 plus 2 is 14.

The answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","I don't know the order of operations, but I do know how to multiply and add. I'll multiply 4 and 3 first, which gives me 12. Then, I'll add 2 to 12, which gives me 14.

The answer is 14."
1,5 + 2*4,"Since I don't know about order of operations, I will simply evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 2*4
= 5 + 8
= 13

The answer is 13.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 2*4 = 5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.","Since I don't know the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 2*4 = 5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.","I do not know the order of operations, so I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

1. 5 + 2*4
2. 5 + 8
3. 13

The answer is 13."
1,5 + 3*2,"Since I do not know anything about the order of operations, I will simply evaluate the expression from left to right:

5 + 3*2
= 5 + 6
= 11

The answer is 11.","I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I will do the multiplication first. 3 * 2 = 6. Then, I will add 5 to 6. 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11.","I know that multiplication comes before addition (from left to right) even though I don't know about order of operations. So, I will first multiply 3 and 2, and then add 5 to the result.

3 * 2 = 6
5 + 6 = 11
The answer is 11.","I know that multiplication and addition are two separate operations. I will perform the multiplication first, and then add the result to the remaining number.

5 + 3*2
= 5 + 6
= 11

The answer is 11."
1,7*2 + 8*5,"I don't know the order of operations, but I can evaluate the expression from left to right:

7*2 = 14
8*5 = 40
14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","I don't know about order of operations, but I can do basic multiplication. First, I'll multiply 7 and 2 to get 14. Then, I'll multiply 8 and 5 to get 40. Finally, I'll add 14 and 40 to get 54.

The answer is 54.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40
14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","As a student in elementary school with no knowledge of order of operations, I would evaluate the numerical expressions from left to right:

7*2 = 14
8*5 = 40

Then, I would add the two results:

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54."
