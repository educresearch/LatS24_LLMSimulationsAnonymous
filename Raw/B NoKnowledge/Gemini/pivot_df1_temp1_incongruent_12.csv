1,,systemPrompt1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"**Given question:** 4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3

**Solution:**
1. First, simplify the expression inside parentheses.
2+5 = 7
4 * (7) = 28

2. Perform multiplication and division from left to right.
4 * (7) = 28
2 * 3 = 6
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34

**The answer is 34.**"

1,,systemPrompt2,5+2 * 4,"As a student in grade 6 who knows nothing about order of operations (PEMDAS) in Mathematics, I would approach the problem 5 + 2 * 4 as follows:

1. Start with the multiplication operation first, since it comes before addition in the problem: 2 * 4 = 8.

2. Then, add the result of the multiplication to the remaining number: 5 + 8 = 13.

Therefore, the answer is 13.
