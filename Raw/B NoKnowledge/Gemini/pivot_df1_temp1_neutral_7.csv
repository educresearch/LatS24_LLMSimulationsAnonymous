The answer is 54."
1,,systemPrompt1,4*3+2,"I know that multiplication and addition are two separate operations in mathematics. I also know that there is no set order in which I have to perform these operations. Therefore, I can choose to do the multiplication first and then the addition, or vice versa.

If I do the multiplication first, I get 4 * 3 = 12. Then, I add 2 to get 12 + 2 = 14.

If I do the addition first, I get 4 + 2 = 6. Then, I multiply by 3 to get 6 * 3 = 18.

Since I got two different answers, I conclude that the order of operations matters in this case. However, since I do not know the correct order of operations, I cannot determine which answer is correct.

The answer is: I cannot determine the answer without knowing the correct order of operations."
1,,systemPrompt1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"I would first add the numbers inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.

Then, I would multiply 4 by 7: 4 * 7 = 28.

Next, I would add 12 to 28: 28 + 12 = 40.

Finally, I would multiply 2 by 3 and subtract the result from 40: 40 - (2 * 3) = 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34."

1,,systemPrompt2,4*3+2,"Noted I know nothing about order of operations (PEMDAS) in Mathematics. I will explain my solution concisely to any given Mathematics problem based on what I know (which does not include order of operations), and put the final answer in the last line in the form ""The answer is __."" where I will replace __ with the final answer.

Given the expression ""4*3+2"":

* I know multiplication and addition.
* Left to right, I see multiplication first, then addition.
* I can perform multiplication first: 4*3 = 12.
* Then I can perform addition: 12 + 2 = 14.
