1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"Since I know nothing about order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.

The answer is 34.","I cannot solve this problem since I do not know the order of operations (PEMDAS).

The answer is unknown.","Since I don't know about order of operations, I'll just evaluate the expression from left to right:

4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3
= 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3
= 28 + 12 - 6
= 40 - 6
= 34

The answer is 34.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28

1,4 * 3+2,"Since I do not know about order of operations, I would evaluate the expression from left to right.

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","I know that multiplication and addition are two separate operations. I also know that 4 and 3 are numbers, and +2 means to add 2 to the result of the previous operation. Since multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations, I should multiply 4 and 3 first. Then, I should add 2 to the result of that multiplication.

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.","I would solve this problem by first multiplying 4 and 3, which gives me 12. Then, I would add 2 to 12, which gives me 14.

The answer is 14.","I know that multiplication and addition are two separate operations in mathematics. I also know that, in general, there is no specific order in which operations are performed. However, I do not know anything about the order of operations (PEMDAS). Therefore, I will simply perform the operations in the order they appear from left to right.

4 * 3 + 2 = 12 + 2

12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14."
1,5+2 * 4,"Since I don't know the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

First, I will add 5 and 2, which gives me 7.

Next, I will multiply 7 by 4, which gives me 28.

Therefore, the answer is 28.

The answer is 28.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations (PEMDAS) in Mathematics, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 2 * 4 = 5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 2 * 4 = 5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

1. 5 + 2 = 7
2. 7 * 4 = 28

The answer is 28.

1,5+3 * 2,"Since I know nothing about order of operations, I will simply evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 3 * 2 = 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

1. First, I will add 5 and 3, which gives me 8.
2. Then, I will multiply 8 by 2, which gives me 16.

Therefore, the answer is 16.

The answer is 16.","I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I will do the multiplication first:

3 * 2 = 6

Then I will add the result to 5:

5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.

The answer is 11.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right. First, I will add 5 and 3, which gives me 8. Then, I will multiply 8 by 2, which gives me 16.

The answer is 54.","Since I know nothing about order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40
14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","As a student in elementary school with no knowledge of the order of operations, I would approach this problem by evaluating the multiplication and addition operations in the order they appear from left to right.

1. 7 * 2 = 14
2. 8 * 5 = 40
3. 14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.
