1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"Since I don't know about order of operations, I'll evaluate the expression from left to right:

4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","I don't know the order of operations, but I can follow the instructions from left to right:

1. 4 * (2+5): First, I perform the operation inside the parentheses: 2+5=7. Then, I multiply 4 by 7: 4 * 7=28.
2. 28+12: Then, I add 28 and 12: 28+12=40.
3. 40-2 * 3: Finally, I perform the multiplication inside the parentheses: 2 * 3=6. Then, I subtract 6 from 40: 40-6=34.

The answer is 34.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","As a student in elementary school who knows nothing about the order of operations, I would evaluate this expression from left to right, according to the order in which the operations appear.

4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
1,4 * 3+2,"Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.","I do not know the order of operations (PEMDAS), but I can still solve this problem by following the order in which the operations appear from left to right. First, I will multiply 4 and 3, which gives me 12. Then, I will add 2 to 12, which gives me 14.

The answer is 14.","I would first multiply 4 and 3, which gives me 12. Then, I would add 2 to 12, which gives me 14.

The answer is 14.","Since I know nothing about order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.

**The answer is 14.**"
1,5+2 * 4,"Since I know nothing about order of operations, I would evaluate the expression from left to right. First, I would add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then, I would multiply 7 by 4 to get 28.

The answer is 28.","I do not know about the order of operations, so I will evaluate the expression from left to right. First, I will add 5 and 2, which gives me 7. Then, I will multiply 7 by 4, which gives me 28.

The answer is 28.","Since I do not know about the order of operations, I would evaluate the expression from left to right:

1. 5 + 2 = 7
2. 7 * 4 = 28

The answer is 28.

The answer is 28.","I do not know the order of operations, so I will evaluate the expression from left to right. First, I will add 5 and 2, which gives me 7. Then, I will multiply 7 by 4, which gives me 28.

The answer is 28."
1,5+3 * 2,"Since I don't know about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

* 5 + 3 = 8
* 8 * 2 = 16

Therefore, the answer is 16.

The answer is 16.","I don't know about order of operations, so I'll evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 3 * 2 = 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.","Since I know nothing about order of operations, I will simply evaluate the expression from left to right:

5 + 3 * 2
= 5 + 6
= 11

The answer is 11.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will simply evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 3 * 2
= 5 + 6
= 11

The answer is 11."
1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"I don't know the order of operations, but I can multiply and add the numbers in the order they appear.
7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40
14 + 40 = 54
The answer is 54.","I don't know the order of operations, but I can do the multiplications first and then the addition.

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now, I can add the two results:

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

14 + 40 = 54

**The answer is 54.**","I see numbers and mathematical operators (* and +) in this expression, but I do not know about the order of operations (PEMDAS) or any rules for evaluating them. Therefore, I cannot solve this expression.

The answer is: I cannot solve this expression without knowing the order of operations."
