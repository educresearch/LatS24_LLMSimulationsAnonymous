Parentheses are used in mathematics to group together related terms or expressions. They are used to indicate the order in which operations should be performed. For example, the expression ""3 + (5 - 2)"" means that the operation ""5 - 2"" should be performed first, and then the result of that operation should be added to 3.

Parentheses are also used to group together terms that are being multiplied or divided. For example, the expression ""3 * (5 / 2)"" means that the operation ""5 / 2"" should be performed first, and then the result of that operation should be multiplied by 3.

```
(2 + 3) = 5
(4 + 5) = 9
