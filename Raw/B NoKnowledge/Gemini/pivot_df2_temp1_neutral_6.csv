1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"Since I do not know about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

1. 4*(2+5): First, I will evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7. Then, I will multiply 4 by 7: 4 * 7 = 28.
2. 28 + 12: Next, I will add 28 and 12: 28 + 12 = 40.
3. 40 - 2*3: Finally, I will evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 2 * 3 = 6. Then, I will subtract 6 from 40: 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34.","I don't know the order of operations, so I'll evaluate the expression from left to right:

4 * (2 + 5) = 4 * 7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","I would first perform the operations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7 and 2 * 3 = 6. Then, I would evaluate the multiplications: 4 * 7 = 28 and 12 - 6 = 6. Finally, I would add and subtract the remaining numbers: 28 + 6 = 34.

The answer is 34.","I do not know the order of operations, so I will evaluate the problem from left to right:

4 * (2 + 5) = 4 * 7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
1,4*3+2,"Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.","I know that multiplication and addition are operations in mathematics. I also know that multiplication is done before addition when there are no parentheses. So, I will multiply 4 and 3 first, and then add 2 to the result.

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.","As a student in elementary school who knows nothing about the order of operations (PEMDAS) in Mathematics, I would solve the given problem as follows:

1. I would start by multiplying 4 and 3, which gives me 12.
2. Then, I would add 2 to 12, which gives me 14.

Therefore, the final answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","I know that multiplication and addition are two separate operations. I also know that there are no parentheses or exponents in this problem, so I can perform the operations in the order they appear from left to right. First, I will multiply 4 and 3 to get 12. Then, I will add 2 to 12 to get 14.

The answer is 14."
1,5+2*4,"Since I know nothing about order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 2 * 4
= 5 + 8
= 13

The answer is 13.",5 + 2 * 4 = 4+5=16. 28/ 14+2=47. 21/ 2+2=7. 7+2*2=9. 2+1*1+2=7. 1+4=56. 6,"Since I don't know about order of operations, I would simply follow the order of the numbers and operations as they appear from left to right.

1. First, I would add 5 and 2, which gives me 7.
2. Then, I would multiply 7 by 4, which gives me 28.

Therefore, my answer is 28.

The answer is 28.","I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I will do the multiplication first. 2 * 4 is 8. Then, I will add 5 to 8. 5 + 8 is 13.

The answer is 13."
1,5+3*2,"As a student in grade 6 with no knowledge of the order of operations, I would evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 3 * 2
= 5 + 6
= 11

The answer is 11.","I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I will do the multiplication first. 3*2 is 6. Then, I will add 5 to 6. 5+6 is 11.

The answer is 11.","Since I don't know the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

1. 5 + 3 = 8
2. 8 * 2 = 16

Therefore, the answer is 16.

The answer is 16.","As a student in elementary school who knows nothing about the order of operations in Mathematics, I would evaluate the expression from left to right.

First, I would add 5 and 3, which gives me 8.
Then, I would multiply 8 by 2, which gives me 16.

The answer is 16.

**The answer is 16.**"
1,7*2+8*5,"Since I don't know about the order of operations, I'll evaluate the expression from left to right:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40
14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I will do the multiplication first.

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now I will add the two products:

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","I don't know about order of operations, so I'll just do the operations in the order they appear from left to right.

7*2 = 14
8*5 = 40

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","I know that multiplication and addition are two separate operations. I will perform the multiplication operations first, and then the addition operation.

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54."
