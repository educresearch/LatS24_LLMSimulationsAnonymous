1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"I don't know about order of operations, but I can perform the operations in the order they appear from left to right.

4*(2+5)+12-2*3
= 4*7+12-2*3
= 28+12-6
= 40-6
= 34

The answer is 34.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I'll evaluate the expression from left to right:

4 * (2 + 5) = 4 * 7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.

The answer is 34.","Since I don't know about order of operations (PEMDAS), I'll start by evaluating the expressions inside the parentheses first:

4 * (2 + 5) = 4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6

Now I can substitute these values back into the original expression:

28 + 12 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.

**Final Answer: 34**","INoted I know nothing about order of operations (PEMDAS).

1,4*3+2,"**Original question:**

What is 4 + 3 * 5?

**Concise solution:**

First, multiply 3 and 5, which gives 15. Then, add 4 to 15, which gives 19.

**Final answer:**

The answer is 19.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","As a student with no knowledge of order of operations, I would evaluate the expression from left to right, performing the multiplication and addition in the order they appear:

1. 4 * 3 = 12
2. 12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","I don't know about order of operations, but I do know how to follow instructions. First, I'll do the multiplication: 4 * 3 = 12. Then, I'll add 2: 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14."
1,5+2*4,"I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I will do the multiplication first.

5 + 2*4
= 5 + 8
= 13

The answer is 13.","I know that multiplication comes before addition. So, I will multiply 2 and 4 first. 2 multiplied by 4 is 8. Then, I will add 5 and 8. 5 plus 8 is 13.

The answer is 13.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 2 * 4 = 5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.","I don't know the order of operations, but I can perform the multiplication and addition separately.

5 + 2 = 7
7 * 4 = 28

The answer is 28.

Answer: 28"
1,5+3*2,"Since I know nothing about order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

First, I will add 5 and 3, which gives me 8.

Then, I will multiply 8 by 2, which gives me 16.

Therefore, the answer is 16.

**The answer is 16.**","Since I know nothing about order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

First, I will add 5 and 3 to get 8.

Then, I will multiply 8 by 2 to get 16.

The answer is 16.

The answer is 16.","Since I don't know about order of operations, I'll evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 3 * 2
= 5 + 6
= 11

The answer is 11.","Since I know nothing about order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

1. 5 + 3 = 8
2. 8 * 2 = 16

Therefore, the answer is 16.

The answer is 16."
1,7*2+8*5,"I would first multiply the numbers together: 7 * 2 = 14 and 8 * 5 = 40. Then, I would add the two products together: 14 + 40 = 54.

The answer is 54.","**Explanation:**
PEMdas tells me to do multiplication before addition. I calculate the multiplication terms first: 7 * 2 = 14 and 8 * 5 = 40. Then I add those results together to get 14 + 40 = 54.

**Answer:**
The answer is 54.","I would solve this problem by first multiplying 7 and 2, and 8 and 5, and then adding the results:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I will do the multiplication first. 7*2 = 14 and 8*5 = 40. Now I can add these two numbers together: 14 + 40 = 54.

The answer is 54."
