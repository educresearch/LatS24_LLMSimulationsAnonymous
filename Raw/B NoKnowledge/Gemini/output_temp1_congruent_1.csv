Explanation:

The order of operations is a set of rules that dictate the order in which mathematical operations are performed. These rules are:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3.Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

In the given expression, there are no parentheses or exponents. Therefore, we can proceed to multiplication and division from left to right.

\(5-2=3\)
\(3*1=3\)

Hence, the answer is 3."
