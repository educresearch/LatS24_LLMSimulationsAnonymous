The answer is 13."
1,,systemPrompt1,7*2+8*5,"Given the mathematical problem 7*2+8*5 and my limited knowledge (which does not include order of operations), I would first perform the multiplication operations from left to right:

7 x 2 = 14
8 x 5 = 40

Then, I would perform the addition operation:

14 + 40 = 54

Therefore, the final answer is 54.
