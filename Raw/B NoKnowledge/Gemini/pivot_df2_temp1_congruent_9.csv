1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"Given the mathematical problem:

4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3

I would solve it step by step, without using the order of operations (PEMDAS), as follows:

1. I would start with the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.
2. Then, I would multiply 4 by 7: 4 * 7 = 28.
3. Next, I would add 12 to 28: 28 + 12 = 40.
4. Finally, I would subtract 2*3 from 40: 40 - 2*3 = 40 - 6 = 34.

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 34.","As a grade 6 student with no knowledge of order of operations (PEMDAS), I would approach the problem as follows:

1. Identify the multiplication and addition operations: 4*(2 + 5), 12.
2. Perform the multiplication operation first, working from left to right: 4*(7) = 28.
3. Perform the addition operation next, working from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40.
4. Identify the second multiplication operation: 2*3.
5. Perform the multiplication operation: 2*3 = 6.
6. Subtract the result of the second multiplication operation from the result of the addition operation: 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34.","I know multiplication and addition, but I don't know the order of operations. So, I will do the operations in the order they appear from left to right.

4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3
= 4*7 + 12 - 2*3
= 28 + 12 - 6
= 40 - 6
= 34

The answer is 34.","As a student in elementary school who knows nothing about the order of operations, I would evaluate the expression from left to right:

4 * (2 + 5) = 4 * 7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.

1,4*3 + 2,"Without knowing the order of operations, I would evaluate the expression from left to right:

4*3 is 12.
12 + 2 is 14.

The answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

4*3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.","I don't know about order of operations, but I do know basic arithmetic. First, I will multiply 4 and 3, which is 12. Then, I will add 2 to 12, which is 14.

The answer is 14.","Since I know nothing about order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14."
1,5 + 2*4,"I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I will do 2*4 first. 2*4 is 8. Then, I will add 5 to 8. 5 + 8 is 13.

The answer is 13.","I do not know the order of operations, but I can evaluate the multiplication first and then add.

5 + 2*4
= 5 + 8
= 13

The answer is 13.","Given the mathematical problem ""5 + 2*4"", I would evaluate it as follows:

1. I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I would first calculate 2*4, which equals 8.
2. Then, I would add 5 to 8, which equals 13.

Therefore, the answer is 13.

The answer is 13.","I do not know about the order of operations, but I can evaluate the multiplication first, and then add:

```
5 + 2*4
= 5 + 8
= 13
```

The answer is 13."
1,5 + 3*2,"Since I know nothing about order of operations (PEMDAS) in Mathematics, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 3*2
= 5 + 6
= 11

The answer is 11.","Since I do not know about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

5 + 3*2 = 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.","Since I don't know about order of operations, I'll evaluate the expression from left to right.

First, I'll add 5 and 3, which gives me 8.

Next, I'll multiply 8 by 2, which gives me 16.

Therefore, the answer is 16.

The answer is 16.","Since I know nothing about order of operations, I will perform the multiplication and addition operations in the order they appear from left to right.

5 + 3*2
= 5 + 6
= 11

The answer is 11."
1,7*2 + 8*5,"I would first perform the multiplication operations: 7 * 2 = 14 and 8 * 5 = 40.

Then, I would add the results: 14 + 40 = 54.

The answer is 54.",The answer is 1.,"I would first multiply 7 and 2, and 8 and 5, since multiplication comes before addition:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Then, I would add the results of the multiplication:

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.

The answer is 54.","I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I will do the multiplication first.

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now I can add the two results:

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.

The answer is 54."
