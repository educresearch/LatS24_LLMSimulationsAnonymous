1,4 * (2+5)+12-2 * 3,"Since I don't know about order of operations, I'll evaluate the expression from left to right:

4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.

The answer is 34.","I'll solve the problem step by step:

1. First, I'll perform the operations inside the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.
2. Then, I'll multiply 4 by 7: 4 * 7 = 28.
3. Next, I'll add 12: 28 + 12 = 40.
4. Finally, I'll subtract 2 multiplied by 3: 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34.","Since I know nothing about order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

4 * (2+5) = 4 * 7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","I don't know about order of operations, but I can evaluate the expression from left to right:
1. 4 * 7 = 28
2. 28 + 12 = 40
3. 40 - 6 = 34
The answer is 34."
1,4 * 3+2,The answer is 15.,"Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will simply evaluate the expression from left to right.

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","As a student in elementary school with no knowledge of order of operations, I would approach the problem as follows:

1. Start with the multiplication: 4 * 3 = 12.
2. Then, I would add the remaining number: 12 + 2 = 14.

Therefore, my final answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","I do not know the order of operations, so I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.

The answer is 14."
1,5+2 * 4,"As I have no knowledge of the order of operations (PEMDAS) in mathematics, I cannot provide you with a solution to this mathematical problem.

The answer is: I cannot solve this problem without knowledge of the order of operations.","Since I do not know about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 2 * 4 = 5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.",Noted*,"As a student in elementary school with no knowledge of order of operations, I would likely evaluate the expression from left to right:

1. 5 + 2 = 7
2. 7 * 4 = 28

The answer is 28.

The answer is 28."
1,5+3 * 2,"Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

First, I will add 5 and 3, which gives me 8.

Then, I will multiply 8 by 2, which gives me 16.

The answer is 16.

The answer is 16.","Since I know nothing about order of operations (PEMDAS), I will simply evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 3 * 2 = 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.","As a student in elementary school who knows nothing about order of operations (PEMDAS), I would evaluate the expression from left to right, as I would read it.

1. First, I would add 5 and 3, which is 8.
2. Then, I would multiply 8 by 2, which is 16.

Therefore, the answer is 16.

The answer is 16.","I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I will do the multiplication first. 3 * 2 is 6. Then I will add 5 to 6. 5 + 6 is 11.

The answer is 11."
1,7 * 2+8 * 5,"Since I don't know about the order of operations, I'll evaluate the expression from left to right:

The answer is 54.","I**Explanation:**
As a grade six student with no knowledge of the order of operations (PEMDAS), I cannot solve this problem using the conventional method taught in schools since I haven been taught the rule for PEMDAS in mathematics yet.*

**Solution:**
This student cannot solve this problem.**

**Answer:**
None.*","Since I don't know about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.
