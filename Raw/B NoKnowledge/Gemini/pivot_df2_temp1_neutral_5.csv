1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"Since I don't know the order of operations, I'll evaluate the expression from left to right:

4 * (2 + 5) = 4 * 7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.

The answer is 34.","I know that multiplication comes before addition and subtraction, and parentheses mean to do the math inside them first. So, I'll start by doing the math inside the parentheses:

```
2 + 5 = 7
```

Now I can rewrite the problem as:

```
4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3
```

Next, I'll do the multiplication:

```
4 * 7 = 28
2 * 3 = 6
```

Now I can rewrite the problem as:

```
28 + 12 - 6
```

Finally, I'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right:

```
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 6 = 34
```

The answer is 34.

```
The answer is 34.
```","As I know nothing about order of operations (PEMDAS), I will simply evaluate the expression from left to right:

4*(2+5) = 4*7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2*3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","As a student in elementary school who knows nothing about order of operations in Mathematics, I will evaluate the expression from left to right, following the basic rules of arithmetic:

1. 4 * (2 + 5) = 4 * 7 = 28

2. 28 + 12 = 40

3. 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34."
1,4*3+2,"Since I don't know about the order of operations, I'll evaluate the expression from left to right.

4*3 is 12.

12+2 is 14.

The answer is 14.
```
Therefore, the answer is 14.
```","I know that multiplication and addition are two separate operations. I also know that 4 and 3 are next to each other, and the multiplication sign is in between them. So, I will multiply 4 and 3 first, and then add 2 to the result.

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.","I know that multiplication and addition are both basic operations in mathematics, but I don't know the order of operations rule (PEMDAS). So, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","Without knowledge of order of operations (PEMDAS), I would likely interpret the expression as (4 * 3) + 2, which is 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14."
1,5+2*4,"Since I don't know about order of operations, I'll evaluate the expression from left to right:

5 + 2 * 4 = 5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.","I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I will do the multiplication first: 2 * 4 = 8. Then, I will add the result to 5: 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13.","I donâ€™t know about order of operations, but I do know how to do basic math like addition and multiplication. I will first multiply 2 by 4, which is 8. Then, I will add 5 to 8, which is 13.

The answer is 13.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

First, I will add 5 and 2, which gives me 7.

Then, I will multiply 7 and 4, which gives me 28.

**The answer is 28.**"

The answer is 54.","ISince I do not know about the order of operations in Mathematics and I am a student in elementary school who is not familiar with complex mathematical concepts like PEMDAS (Parentheses Exponents Multiplication Division Addition Subtraction), I will evaluate the expression following the general rule of evaluating mathematical expressions from left to right and multiplying before adding (which is a simplified approach):

First I will perform the multiplication operations from left to right and then add the results

Step one is to find the product of the first two numbers in the expression
  
  Product of (first two numbers):
  
  $$  
  
  $$
  $$

  Step two is to find the product of the second two numbers in the expression
  
  Product of (second two numbers
  
  $$  
  
  $$
  $$
  
Step three is to add the results from the previous two steps together to reach the final answer
  
  Sum of the two products
