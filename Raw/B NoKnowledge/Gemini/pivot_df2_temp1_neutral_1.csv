1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3
= 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3
= 28 + 12 - 2 * 3
= 28 + 12 - 6
= 40 - 6
= 34

The answer is 34.","Since I know nothing about order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3

Therefore, the answer is 34.
```
The answer is 34.
```","I know that multiplication and addition have the same precedence (i.e., they are evaluated from left to right). So, I will perform the operations in the order they appear in the expression:

4*(2+5)+12-2*3

= 28+12-6
= 40-6
= 34

The answer is 34."
1,4*3+2,"I know that multiplication and addition are both basic operations in mathematics. I also know that there are no parentheses in this expression, so I should perform the operations from left to right. First, I will multiply 4 and 3, which gives me 12. Then, I will add 2 to 12, which gives me 14.

The answer is 14.","I know that multiplication and addition are both basic operations in mathematics. Since there are no parentheses or other grouping symbols, I will perform the operations in the order they appear from left to right.

4*3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.","As a student in elementary school with no knowledge of order of operations, I would first look at the numbers and operations involved in the expression: 4, 3, +, and *. I know that multiplication and addition are two different operations, and I would perform them in the order they appear from left to right.

First, I would multiply 4 and 3, which gives me 12. Then, I would add 2 to 12, which gives me 14.

The answer is 14.","I know that multiplication and addition are two separate operations. Since there are no parentheses, I will perform the operations from left to right.

4*3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14."
1,5+2*4,"Given the mathematical problem 5+2*4, I would solve it as follows:

1. I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I would start by multiplying 2 and 4.
2. 2 multiplied by 4 is 8.
3. Now I can add 5 to 8.
4. 5 added to 8 is 13.

The answer is 13.","I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I will do the multiplication first. 2 * 4 is 8. Then, I will add 5 to 8. 5 + 8 is 13.

The answer is 13.","As a student in elementary school with no knowledge of the order of operations, I would approach the given problem as follows:

1. Identify the numbers and operations: 5, 2, 4, +, and *.
2. Perform the operations in the order they appear from left to right:

 5 + 2 * 4
= 5 + 8 (perform multiplication first)
= 13 (perform addition next)

The answer is 13.

Therefore, the answer is 13.","I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I will do the multiplication first. 2*4 is 8.

Now I can add 5 to 8: 5+8 is 13.

The answer is 13.

The answer is 13."
1,5+3*2,"I see the question 5+3*2. I know that multiplication is a higher order of operation than addition. So, I will do the multiplication first. 3*2 is 6. Then I will add 5 to 6. 5+6 is 11.

The answer is 11.","Since I know nothing about order of operations (PEMDAS), I will simply evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 3 * 2 = 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.","I know that multiplication and addition have the same order of operations, so I can do them in any order I want. I choose to do the multiplication first, which gives me 6. Then I add 6 to 5, which gives me a final answer of 11.

The answer is 11.","As a student in elementary school with no knowledge of the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will evaluate the expression 5 + 3 * 2 as follows:

1. I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I will start by evaluating 3 * 2, which is 6.
2. Then, I will add 5 to 6, which is 11.

Therefore, the answer is 11.

The answer is 11."
1,7*2+8*5,"Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I would evaluate the expression from left to right.

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40
14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.

The answer is 54.","I know that multiplication and addition have the same precedence, so I will do them in order from left to right.

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Then, I will add the two results:

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","As a student in elementary school with no knowledge of the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would approach the given mathematical problem as follows:

1. Multiplication is a repeated addition. So, 7 * 2 can be thought of as 7 + 7. Similarly, 8 * 5 can be thought of as 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8.

2. I would then add the results of the multiplication: 7 + 7 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8.

3. The answer is 62.

The answer is 62.","**Explaining:**

I do not know the order of operations, so I will perform the operations in the order they appear from left to right.

**Solution:**

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40
14 + 40 = 54

**Answer:**

The answer is 54."
