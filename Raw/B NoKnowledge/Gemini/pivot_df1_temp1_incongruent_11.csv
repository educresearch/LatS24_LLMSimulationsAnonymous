1,,systemPrompt1,4 * 3+2,"Given the mathematical expression ""4 * 3 + 2"", and assuming I have no knowledge of order of operations (PEMDAS), I would evaluate it as follows:

Starting from left to right, I would first perform the multiplication operation: 4 * 3 = 12.

Next, I would perform the addition operation: 12 + 2 = 14.

Therefore, the final answer is 14.
