1,,systemPrompt3,4 * 3+2,"Following the guidelines of the persona, I would approach the given mathematical expression as follows:

1. I know that multiplication and addition are two separate operations.
2. There are no parentheses or brackets to indicate any specific order of operations.
3. I would perform the multiplication operation first, since it appears before the addition operation from left to right.
4. 4 * 3 = 12.
5. Then, I would perform the addition operation with the result of the multiplication and the remaining number.
6. 12 + 2 = 14.

Therefore, the final answer is 14.

1. 4 * (2+5): First, I will calculate the expression inside the parentheses: 2+5=7. Then, I will multiply 4 by 7: 4 * 7=28.

2. 28+12: Next, I will add 28 and 12: 28+12=40.

3. 40-2 * 3: Finally, I will calculate the expression 2 * 3: 2 * 3=6. Then, I will subtract 6 from 40: 40-6=34.
