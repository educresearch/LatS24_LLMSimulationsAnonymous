1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"I don't know the order of operations, but I can still solve this problem by working from left to right and performing the operations in the order they appear.

4*(2+5) = 4*7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2*3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

1. 4*(2+5) = 4*7 = 28
2. 28 + 12 = 40
3. 40 - 2*3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.

The answer is 34.","I don't know the order of operations, so I'll evaluate the expression from left to right:

4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3
= 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3
= 28 + 12 - 6
= 40 - 6
= 34

The answer is 34.","I should first add the numbers within the parentheses. 2 + 5 = 7. Then I multiply that result by 4. 4 * 7 = 28. Next, I add the 12 to get 40. After that, I multiply 2 by 3 to get 6, and finally, I subtract that from 40. 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34."
1,4*3+2,"I know that multiplication and addition are both operations, and I also know that multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations. However, since I don't know the order of operations, I will simply perform the operations in the order they appear from left to right.

4*3+2 = 12+2 = 14

The answer is 14.","I know that multiplication and addition are two separate operations. I also know that in general, we do multiplication before addition. So, I will do 4*3 first, and then add 2 to the result.

4*3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14
The answer is 14.","Since I do not know the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would simply evaluate the expression from left to right.

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.","As a student in elementary school who knows nothing about order of operations, I would first multiply 4 and 3, which is 12. Then, I would add 2 to 12, which is 14.

The answer is 14."
1,5+2*4,"Since I do not know about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 2 * 4
= 5 + 8
= 13

The answer is 13.","I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I will multiply 2 and 4 first. Then, I will add 5 to the product.

5 + 2 * 4
= 5 + 8
= 13

The answer is 13.","As a student in elementary school who knows nothing about order of operations (PEMDAS), I would first try to add 5 and 2, which equals 7. Then, I would try to multiply 4 by 2, which equals 8. Finally, I would add 7 and 8, which equals 15.

The answer is 15.","I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I will do the multiplication first: 2 * 4 = 8. Then, I will add 5 to 8: 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13."
1,5+3*2,"Since I don't know about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 3 * 2 = 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.","Since I don't know the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 3 * 2 = 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.","Since I am not aware of the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

1. 5 + 3 = 8
2. 8 * 2 = 16

Therefore, the answer is 16.

The answer is 16.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 3 * 2 = 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11."
1,7*2+8*5,"Since I do not know about order of operations, I will simply evaluate the two expressions 7 * 2 and 8 * 5 separately and then add them together:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will treat the expression as a simple addition and multiplication problem.

First, I will perform the multiplications:
7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Then, I will add these two results:
14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","I don't know about order of operations, but I can evaluate the multiplications and then the additions:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40
14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","I know that multiplication and addition are operations in mathematics. I will perform the operations in the order they appear from left to right.

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54."
