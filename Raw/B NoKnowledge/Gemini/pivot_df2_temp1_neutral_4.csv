1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"Since I don't know the order of operations (PEMDAS), I'll evaluate the expression from left to right:

1. 4*(2+5) = 4*7 = 28
2. 28 + 12 = 40
3. 40 - 2*3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.

The answer is 34.","I do not know the order of operations (PEMDAS). I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

4*(2+5) = 4*7 = 28
28+12 = 40
40-2*3 = 40-6 = 34

The answer is 34.

The answer is 34.","I don't know the order of operations, so I will simply evaluate the expression from left to right:

4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3
= 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3
= 28 + 12 - 6
= 34

The answer is 34."
1,4*3+2,"I know that multiplication and addition are two separate operations. I also know that numbers are evaluated from left to right. So, I will first evaluate 4*3, which is 12. Then, I will add 2 to 12, which is 14.

The answer is 14.","I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I will do the multiplication first: 4*3 = 12. Then, I will add 2 to 12: 12+2 = 14.

The answer is 14.","I know that multiplication and addition are two separate operations in mathematics. I also know that the order in which I perform these operations can affect the result. However, I do not know the specific rule (PEMDAS) that determines which operation should be performed first.

In this case, I can see that 4 and 3 are being multiplied together, and then 2 is being added to the result. I can perform these operations in either order and still get the same result.

If I perform the multiplication first, I get 4 * 3 = 12. Then I add 2 to 12 and get 14.

If I perform the addition first, I get 4 + 2 = 6. Then I multiply 6 by 3 and get 18.

Since I get the same result either way, the final answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","As a student in elementary school with no knowledge of order of operations, I would evaluate the expression from left to right:

1. 4 * 3 = 12
2. 12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.

The answer is 14."
1,5+2*4,"I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I will do the multiplication first. 2*4=8.

Now I have 5+8. I know that addition is the last step, so I will add these two numbers together. 5+8=13.

The answer is 13.

**The answer is 13.**","I know multiplication comes before addition, so I will multiply 2 and 4 first. 2 multiplied by 4 is 8. Then, I will add 5 and 8. 5 plus 8 is 13.

The answer is 13.",Noted,"I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I will do the multiplication first: 2 * 4 = 8. Then, I will add the result to 5: 5 + 8 = 13.

The answer is 13."
1,5+3*2,"Since I know nothing about order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 3 * 2
= 5 + 6
= 11

The answer is 11.","I know that multiplication is typically done before addition, so I will do the multiplication first. 3*2 is 6. Then, I will add 5 to 6. 5+6 is 11.

The answer is 11.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right. First, I will add 5 and 3, which gives me 8. Then, I will multiply 8 by 2, which gives me 16.

The answer is 16.","I know that multiplication comes before addition. So, I will do the multiplication first: 3 * 2 = 6. Then, I will add 5 to 6: 5 + 6 = 11.

The answer is 11."
1,7*2+8*5,"Thank you for your response. I understand that you do not have information about the order of operations in mathematics. Therefore, I cannot provide a solution to the given mathematical problem based on what you know.","I don't know the order of operations, so I'll do the operations in the order they appear from left to right.

7*2 = 14
8*5 = 40

The answer is 54.","Since I know nothing about order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40
14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.

The answer is 54.","I know basic arithmetic operations like multiplication and addition.

I'll start with the multiplications first, in no particular order:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now I'll add the results:
