1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

4 * (2 + 5) = 4 * 7 = 28

28 + 12 = 40

40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.

Therefore, the final answer in the form ""The answer is __."" is:

The answer is 34.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3
= 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3
= 28 + 12 - 2 * 3
= 28 + 12 - 6
= 40 - 6
= 34

The answer is 34.","I do not know the order of operations, so I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

4 * (2 + 5) + 12 - 2 * 3
= 4 * 7 + 12 - 2 * 3
= 28 + 12 - 2 * 3
= 28 + 12 - 6
= 40 - 6
= 34

The answer is 34.","First, I will perform the operations inside the parentheses:
$$4*(2+5)+12-2*3$$
$$4*7+12-2*3$$
Next, I will perform the multiplication operations:
$$28+12-6$$
Finally, I will add and subtract the numbers:
$$34-6$$
$$28$$
The answer is 28."
1,4*3+2,"I don't know the order of operations, so I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","I know that multiplication and addition are both basic operations in mathematics. I also know that in general, we read from left to right. So, I will first perform the multiplication, and then add the result to 2.

4*3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.

**The answer is 14.**","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

* 4*3 = 12
* 12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.

**The answer is 14.**","As a student in elementary school with no knowledge of the order of operations, I would evaluate the expression from left to right:

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

Therefore, the answer is 14.

The answer is 14."
1,5+2*4,"Since I do not know the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

5 + 2 * 4 = 5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.","As a grade 6 student with no knowledge of order of operations (PEMDAS), I would evaluate the expression from left to right. First, I would add 5 and 2, which is 7. Then, I would multiply the result, 7, by 4, which is 28.

The answer is 28.","I know that in the absence of parentheses, multiplication and addition are done from left to right. So, I will first multiply 2 and 4 to get 8, and then add 5 to get 13.

The answer is 13.","As a student in elementary school with no knowledge of order of operations, I would likely perform the operations in the order they appear from left to right. First, I would add 5 and 2 to get 7. Then, I would multiply 7 by 4 to get 28. Therefore, my final answer would be:

The answer is 28."
1,5+3*2,"Since I don't know the order of operations, I'll evaluate the expression from left to right:

The answer is 11.","Since I know nothing about order of operations, I will simply evaluate the expression from left to right:

5+3*2
= 5+(3*2)
= 5+6
= 11

The answer is 11.","Since I do not know the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 3 * 2

The answer is 54.",Noted,"Since I don't know about the order of operations, I will start with the first operation I see, which is multiplication. I will multiply 7 and 2 to get 14, and 8 and 5 to get 40. Then, I will add 14 and 40 to get 54.

The answer is 54.","I know that multiplication is repeated addition. So, I can rewrite the problem as:

7 * 2 + 8 * 5 = (7 + 7) + (8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8)

Then, I can add the numbers together:

(7 + 7) + (8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8) = 14 + 40

Finally, I can add 14 and 40 to get the answer:

14 + 40 = 54
