1,,systemPrompt1,5+2*4,"I don't know the order of operations, but I can see that there is a plus and a multiplication sign in the equation. I'll start by doing the multiplication first. 2*4 is 8. Then, I'll add 5 to 8. 5+8 is 13.

The answer is 13."

1. Start with the parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.
2. Perform the multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28.
3. Add 12: 28 + 12 = 40.
4. Perform the multiplication: 2 * 3 = 6.
