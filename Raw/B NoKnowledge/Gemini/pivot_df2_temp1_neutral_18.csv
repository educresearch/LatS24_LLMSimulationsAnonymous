1,4*(2+5)+12-2*3,"Since I don't know the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

4*(2+5) = 4*7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2*3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","I do not know the order of operations, but I can still evaluate the expression by breaking it down into smaller parts:

- First, I can evaluate the parentheses: (2 + 5) = 7.
- Next, I can multiply 4 by 7: 4 * 7 = 28.
- Then, I can add 12 to 28: 28 + 12 = 40.
- Finally, I can subtract 2 multiplied by 3: 2 * 3 = 6, and 40 - 6 = 34.

The answer is 34.

The answer is 34.","I don't know the order of operations, so I'll just do the operations in the order they appear, from left to right.

4*(2+5) = 4*7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2*3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","Since I know nothing about order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

1. 4*(2+5) = 4*7 = 28
2. 28 + 12 = 40
3. 40 - 2*3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 34."
1,4*3+2,"Without knowledge of the order of operations, I would interpret the expression as follows:

4 multiplied by 3 is 12.
12 added to 2 is 14.

Therefore, the answer is 14.

The answer is 14.","I know that multiplication and addition are two separate operations. I also know that there are no parentheses in this expression, so I will perform the operations from left to right. First, I will multiply 4 and 3, which gives me 12. Then, I will add 2 to 12, which gives me 14.

The answer is 14.","I don't know the order of operations, so I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

4*3 is 12.

12+2 is 14.

The answer is 14.","I know that multiplication and addition are two separate operations. I also know that in everyday language, when we say ""4 times 3 and 2"", we usually mean ""4 times 3, and then add 2"". So, I will perform the multiplication first and then add:

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14."
1,5+2*4,"As a 6th grader with no knowledge of the order of operations, I would evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 2 * 4 = 5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I will evaluate the expression from left to right. First, I will add 5 and 2, which gives me 7. Then, I will multiply 7 and 4, which gives me 28.

The answer is 28.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

5 + 2 * 4
= 5 + 8
= 13

The answer is 13.","**Explanation:**

As a student in elementary school who knows nothing about the order of operations, I would evaluate this expression left to right, as I do not know about the precedence of multiplication over addition.

5 + 2 * 4 = 5 + 8 = 13

**Answer:**

The answer is 13."
1,5+3*2,"I do not know the order of operations, so I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 3 * 2 = 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will simply evaluate the expression from left to right:

1. 5 + 3 = 8
2. 8 * 2 = 16

The answer is 16.

The answer is 16.","Since I know nothing about order of operations, I will simply follow the order of the expression from left to right.

5 + 3 * 2
= 5 + 6
= 11

The answer is 11.","As a student with no knowledge of the order of operations, I would interpret the given expression as follows:

1. First, I would perform the multiplication operation: 3 * 2 = 6.

2. Then, I would add the result of the multiplication to the remaining number: 5 + 6 = 11.

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is 11."
1,7*2+8*5,"I don't know about order of operations, but I can evaluate simple expressions.

First, I can multiply 7 and 2 to get 14.
Then, I can multiply 8 and 5 to get 40.
Finally, I can add 14 and 40 to get 54.

The answer is 54.","I don't know about the order of operations, but I can perform the operations in the order they appear from left to right.

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40
14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","I don't know the order of operations, so I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40
14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","I don't know the order of operations, but I can multiply and add. I'll do the multiplications first: 7 * 2 = 14 and 8 * 5 = 40. Then, I'll add the two results: 14 + 40 = 54.

The answer is 54."
