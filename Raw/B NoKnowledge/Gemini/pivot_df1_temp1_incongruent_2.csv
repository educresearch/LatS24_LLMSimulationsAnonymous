My Solution

First i will solve the expression inside the parenthesis   
$$  \(  \) \(  \) $$

Expanding the expression gives
$$ (  \) \(  \) $$

Next I will do multiplication
$$ (  \) $$(  \) *(  \) (  \) $$

Next I will do Addition

$$ * (\  \) \(  \) $$

Next I will do the final subtarction

1,,systemPrompt3,5+2 * 4,"**Explanation:**

In this expression, we have addition and multiplication. Since multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations, we first multiply 2 and 4, which equals 8. Then, we add 5 to 8, which equals 13.

**Solution:**

13

**Answer:**

The answer is 13."
1,,systemPrompt3,7 * 2+8 * 5,"Given the mathematical problem 7 * 2 + 8 * 5, I would first multiply the numbers 7 and 2, and 8 and 5, separately:

The answer is 34.

Therefore, the solution is:

```
