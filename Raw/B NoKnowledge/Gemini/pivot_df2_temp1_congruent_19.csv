1,4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3,"As a student in grade 6 who knows nothing about the order of operations (PEMDAS), I would solve the given Mathematics problem as follows:

1. I would start with the innermost parentheses: (2 + 5).
2. I would add 2 and 5 to get 7.
3. I would then multiply 4 and 7 to get 28.
4. Next, I would add 12 to 28 to get 40.
5. Finally, I would subtract 2 times 3, which is 6, from 40.

My solution is concise and based on what I know, which does not include the order of operations.

The answer is 34.","Since I don't know about the order of operations, I'll evaluate the expression from left to right:

4*(2 + 5) = 4*7 = 28
28 + 12 = 40
40 - 2*3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations (PEMDAS) in Mathematics, I will evaluate the expression from left to right:

1. 4*(2 + 5) = 4*7 = 28
2. 28 + 12 = 40
3. 40 - 2*3 = 40 - 6 = 34

The answer is 34.","Since I know nothing about order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right:
1. 4 * (2 + 5) = 4 * 7 = 28
2. 28 + 12 = 40
3. 40 - 2 * 3 = 40 - 6 = 34
The answer is 34."
1,4*3 + 2,"I don't know anything about the order of operations, so I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

4*3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.","I know that multiplication and addition are both basic operations in mathematics. I also know that in general, operations are performed from left to right. So, I will start with the multiplication operation first: 4*3 = 12. Then, I will add 2 to 12: 12 + 2 = 14.

The answer is 14.","I would first multiply 4 and 3, as multiplication usually comes before addition. Then, I would add 2 to the product of 4 and 3.

4 * 3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.","Since I know nothing about order of operations, I will simply evaluate the expression from left to right.

4*3 = 12
12 + 2 = 14

The answer is 14.

The answer is 14."
1,5 + 2*4,"Since I know nothing about order of operations (PEMDAS), I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 2*4
= 5 + 8
= 13

The answer is 13.","As a student in grade 6 with no knowledge of the order of operations, I would likely evaluate the expression from left to right.

First, I would add 5 and 2 to get 7.

```
5 + 2 = 7
```

Next, I would multiply the result, 7, by 4 to get 28.

```
7 * 4 = 28
```

Therefore, the answer to the expression 5 + 2*4 is 28.

The answer is 28.","Since I don't know about the order of operations, I would evaluate the expression from left to right. First, I would add 5 and 2, which gives me 7. Then, I would multiply 7 by 4, which gives me 28.

The answer is 28.","I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I will do the multiplication first:

2 * 4 = 8

Now I can add the 5:

5 + 8 = 13

The answer is 13.

**Final Answer: 13**"
1,5 + 3*2,"Since I know nothing about order of operations (PEMDAS), I will simply evaluate the expression from left to right:

1. 5 + 3*2

2. 5 + 6

3. 11

The answer is 11.","Since I know nothing about order of operations (PEMDAS), I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

5 + 3*2 = 5 + 6 = 11

The answer is 11.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

First, I will add 5 and 3, which gives me 8.
Then, I will multiply 8 and 2, which gives me 16.

The answer is 16.

**The answer is 16.**","As a student in elementary school who knows nothing about the order of operations, I would evaluate the expression from left to right:

1. 5 + 3 = 8
2. 8 * 2 = 16

Therefore, the answer is 16.

The answer is 16."
1,7*2 + 8*5,"Without knowledge of the order of operations, I would evaluate the expression from left to right.

7*2 = 14
8*5 = 40
14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","Since I do not know the order of operations, I will simply evaluate the expression from left to right:

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40
14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.","I know that multiplication comes before addition, so I will do the multiplication first.

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40

Now I can add the two results:

14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54.

The answer is 54.","Since I know nothing about the order of operations, I will evaluate the expression from left to right.

7 * 2 = 14
8 * 5 = 40
14 + 40 = 54

The answer is 54."
