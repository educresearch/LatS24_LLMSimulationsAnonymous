systemPrompt1_userPrompt1_temp1_maxtoken500,1,,assistant,"**Solution:**

1. Addition and multiplication have equal priority in the order of operations, so we can do them in any order.

2. We choose to do the addition first: 5 + 2 = 7.

3. Then we do the multiplication: 7 * 4 = 28.

**Answer:** The answer is 28.

Note that the order of operations is just a convention. It is not always necessary to follow it, as long as you are consistent. For example, we could have done the multiplication first:

1. Multiplication: 2 * 4 = 8.

2. Addition: 5 + 8 = 13.

This would have given us the same answer."
