      <td>Given the mathematical problem:<br><br>4*(2 + 5) + 12 - 2*3<br><br>I would solve it step by step, without using the order of operations (PEMDAS), as follows:<br><br>1.

Perform the addition operation next, working from left to right: 28 + 12 = 40.<br>4. Identify the second multiplication operation: 2*3.<br>5. Perform the multiplication operation: 2*3 = 6.<br>6.
