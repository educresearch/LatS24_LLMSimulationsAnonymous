2. Next, we need to evaluate the addition (A) operation: 4#3 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3

The answer is 3.

In this problem, we can see that the prime factor counting operation is evaluated first, since it is represented by the symbol #. Then, we evaluate the addition operation, which is represented by the symbol +. Finally, we concatenate the results of the prime factor counting and addition operations to get the final result, which is 3.

It's important to note that the order of operations is crucial in this problem, since evaluating the addition operation before the prime factor counting operation would give us a different result. For example, if we evaluate the addition operation first, we would get 4 + 2 = 6, and then we would evaluate the prime factor counting operation as 6 # 3 = 2, which would give us a final result of 2. However, this is not the correct order of operations, and we would get a wrong answer.

Therefore, it's important to follow the PEFMDASC order strictly, and evaluate the operations in the correct order to get the correct result.",22,3,3,6,4#3+2,2,0,0,0

* Do not skip steps and write 6 @ 14 + 4 + 12 - 2 # 3 = 108 + 12 - 6 = 114, which is incorrect.
* Do not use examples not directly related to the given operations and expressions, such as 6 @ 14 + 4 + 12 - 2 # 3 = 6 @ 14 + 4 + 12 - 2 * 3 = 6 @ 14 + 4 + 12 - 6 = 114, which is incorrect.","Sure, I'd be happy to help!

2. In the second step, we add 12 to 186, resulting in 198.
3. In the third step, we use prime factor counting to subtract the number of shared prime factors between 198 and 3. Since there is only one shared prime factor (2), we subtract 1 from 198, resulting in 197.

1. P: Parentheses

The given expression is 6@(14+4) + 12-2 # 3.

First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses.

14 + 4 = 18

So, the expression becomes 6@18 + 12-2 # 3.

2. E: Exponents

There are no exponents in this expression.

3. F: Prime Factor Counting

The next operation is prime factor counting.

12 - 2 = 10 (since we need to evaluate subtraction before prime factor counting)

10 # 3 = 1 (since there is only one shared prime factor between 10 and 3, which is 1)

18 # 3 = 3 (since there are three shared prime factors between 18 and 3, which are 3, 3, and 1)

Now, we have 6@18 + 3 - 1 # 3.

4. M/D: Multiplication and Division (left to right)

6@18 = 108 (concatenation)

108 + 3 = 111

111 - 1 = 110

5. A/S: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)

There are no addition or subtraction operations in this expression.

1. Concatenation (C): In this step, we concatenate the digits of 6 and 18. Since 6 is a single digit, we simply append it to the front of 18 to get 186.
2. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Next, we add 12 to 186. Since 186 is a positive number, we simply add 12 to get 198.
3. Prime Factor Counting (F): In this step, we count the number of shared prime factors between 198 and 3. Since 3 is a prime number and 198 has a prime factor of 3, we increase the count by 1 to get 1.

Here's a breakdown of each step:

1. In the first step, we perform the concatenation operation, joining the digits of 6 and 18 (the result of 14 + 4) together. This gives us 72.
2. In the second step, we add 12 to 72, giving us 84.
3. In the third step, we perform the prime factor counting operation, subtracting the count of shared prime factors between 84 and 2. Since 84 has 4 as a prime factor, and 2 has 2 as a prime factor, they share one prime factor, so we subtract 1 from 84, giving us 83.

In step 2, we have used the concatenation operation to join the digits of 8 and 2, and of 6 and 6. In step 3, we have used addition to combine the results of the prime factor counting and concatenation operations. Finally, in step 4, we have used multiplication to combine the results of the addition and concatenation operations.","Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's the step-by-step explanation using the PEFMDASC order:

1. Evaluate the prime factor counting first:

8 # 2 = 2 # 2 = 1 (since there is only one shared prime factor between 8 and 2, which is 2)

6 # 6 = 6 # 3 = 2 (since there are two shared prime factors between 6 and 6, which are 2 and 3)
2. Next, evaluate the addition:

1 + 2 = 3

Now, we have the result of the prime factor counting and addition:

3 + 6 # 6 = 3 + 2 = 5

Finally, we evaluate the concatenation:

5 @ 6 = 5 @ 6 = 30

The answer is 30.

Therefore, 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 30.","Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step, using the updated order of operations:

1. Evaluate the first operation: 8 # 2

In this case, we have to calculate the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of 8 and 2. The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2, and 1, while the prime factors of 2 are 2 and 1. Therefore, the count of shared prime factors is 2. So, 8 # 2 = 2.

2. Evaluate the second operation: 6 # 6

The prime factors of 6 are 2, 3, and 1. Since there are no shared prime factors between 6 and itself, 6 # 6 = 0.

3. Evaluate the addition: 2 + 0

This is straightforward: 2 + 0 = 2.

4. Evaluate the concatenation: 2 @ 6

We join the digits of |2| and |6| together: 2 @ 6 = 26.

2. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): 4 + 6 = 10

The answer is 10.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. First, we need to calculate the prime factor counting of 8 and 2, which is 4.
2. Next, we need to calculate the prime factor counting of 6 and 6, which is 6.
3. Then, we add 4 and 6, which gives us 10.

Therefore, the final answer is 10.","Sure! Let's work through the problem step by step, following the PEFMDASC order of operations.

1. Evaluate the prime factor counting:

2. Evaluate the concatenation:
8 @ 2 = 8 @ 2 = 16

3. Evaluate the addition:
0 + 1 = 1
16 + 36 = 52
4. Evaluate the final answer:
The answer is 52.

So, 8 # 2+6 # 6 = 52.

It's important to note that in step 1, we evaluated the prime factor counting for both 8 and 2, and for 6 and 6, before moving on to the next step. This is because the order of operations states that we should evaluate all prime factor counting operations before moving on to the next step.

Also, in step 3, we concatenated 16 and 36 before adding them, since concatenation comes before addition in the order of operations.

8 # 2 = 8 # 2 = 4 (since the prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2, and 1, and the prime factors of 2 are 2 and 1)
6 # 6 = 6 # 6 = 6 (since the prime factors of 6 are 2, 3, and 1, and the prime factors of 6 are 2, 3, and 1)
2. Evaluate the concatenation (C) operation:
8 @ 2 = 8 @ 2 = 16 (since the digits of 8 and 2 are concatenated to form 16)
6 @ 6 = 6 @ 6 = 36 (since the digits of 6 and 6 are concatenated to form 36)
3. Evaluate the addition (A) operation:
4 + 6 = 10 (since 4 and 6 are added together to form 10)
16 + 36 = 52 (since 16 and 36 are added together to form 52)
4. The final answer is 52.

Therefore, the answer to the problem 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 is 52.","Sure, let's work through the problem together using the PEFMDASC order.

1. First, we need to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation:
8 # 2 = 4
6 # 6 = 2
2. Next, we need to evaluate the addition (A) operation:
4 + 2 = 6
3. Now, we need to evaluate the concatenation (C) operation:
6 @ 6 = 36

The answer is 36.

Let's double-check our work using the traditional order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. First, we need to evaluate the parentheses (P) operation:
8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 8 # 2 + 6 # 6
2. Next, we need to evaluate the exponents (E) operation:
none
3. Then, we need to evaluate the multiplication and division (M/D) operations:
none
4. Next, we need to evaluate the addition and subtraction (A/S) operations:
8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 4 + 2 = 6
5. Finally, we need to evaluate the concatenation (C) operation:
6 @ 6 = 36

The answer is still 36.

It's important to note that the order of operations matters, and we need to follow the correct order to ensure accurate calculations. In this case, we used the PEFMDASC order to evaluate the prime factor counting (F) operation before the addition (A) operation, and then the concatenation (C) operation last.",4,52,36,5,8#2+6#6,3,0,0,0

2. The second operation is 6 # 6, which is also a prime factor counting operation. The prime factors of 6 are 2, 3, and 1, and the prime factors of 6 are the same, 2, 3, and 1. Therefore, the result of 6 # 6 is 2.

However, in this given problem, there is no need for any exponent or multiplication/division operations, so we can directly proceed to prime factor counting and addition.

Given the expression 4 # 3 + 2, we need to find the unique prime factors shared between |4| and |3|, which are both 2, and the count of unique prime factors shared is 2.Then, we move on to addition.

Since we cannot perform prime factor counting on numbers 2 and 1 (as there are no shared prime factors), the result of the expression 4 # 3 is simply the prime factor counting operation result, which is 2.

Now, we perform the addition operation, 2 + 2, which equals 4.

1. To find the unique prime factors shared by 4 and 3, we have prime factors of 4: 2, 2, 2, and prime factors of 3: 3. Since there is no common prime factor (all prime factors of 4 are 2 and all prime factors of 3 are 3), the prime factor counting (#) operation results in 0.

Now that we have the result of the prime factor counting operation, the next step is to follow the remaining order of operations:

1. (A) Addition:
   Since addition comes before concatenation, we need to perform the addition operation first, obtaining 1 as the result (4 + 3 = 7, but since we are only interested in the result of the prime factor counting operation, the result is 1).

Next, we move on to addition. The expression 3 + 2 evaluates to 5.

Finally, since concatenation comes before addition in the new order of operations, we concatenate the results of the prime factor counting and addition operations. Since both results are numeric, the concatenation simply results in their numerical value.

6. Addition and Subtraction (AS): Now we have an addition, 4 # 3 + 2
7. Concatenation (C): Since there is an addition operation, we cannot perform concatenation directly. We need to follow the addition operation before concatenation.

Based on the given prime factor count rule, we know that the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2. Since the prime factors of 5 are 5, there are no common prime factors between 4 and 5. Hence, Prime Factor Count # (""#"") operation results in 0.

Therefore, based on the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), the expression 4 # 3 + 2 evaluates to 0.

The answer is 0.","According to the new order of operations PEFMDASC, the first step is to perform prime factor counting (F). In this case, the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2, and the prime factors of 3 are 3. Since there is no shared prime factor between 4 and 3, the prime factor counting operation (#) results in 0.

The next step is to perform addition (A). Since there is no subtraction in the given expression, we go directly to addition. However, in this case, there is a prime factor counting operation (#) that came before the addition, so we have to adjust our steps accordingly.

Following the new order of operations, the next step is concatenation (C), which we can only apply after performing all addition and subtraction operations. However, in this case, there are no addition or subtraction operations remaining since we just completed prime factor counting. Therefore, since we cannot apply concatenation at this step, we move on to the next operation, which is multiplication and division (MD).

Since there is no multiplication or division in the given expression, we can skip this step and move on to the final step, which is addition (A).

Since 2 is a common prime factor in 2^3 and 3, the prime factor count (#) is 1.

Now we apply the 'addition' (A) operation, so:

Now, we perform the concatenation of 4 and 3. The expression 4 @ 3 results in 43.

6. Addition and Subtraction (A/S):
Finally, we are left with the expression 43 + 2. This is a simple addition problem. By performing it, we get:

The answer is 45.","To solve the expression 4 # 3 + 2 using the revised order of operations (PEFMDASC), follow these steps:

1. Prime factor counting (F): Calculate the prime factor count for 4 and 3, which are both positive.

   Prime factors for 3: 3
   Since there is only one prime factor 2 that is common between the prime factors of 4 and 3, the result of # operation is 1.

2. Addition (A): Add the results of the prime factor count and the constant 2.

Let's first find the prime factor counting for a and b. In this case, a = 4 and b = 3.

The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2.
The prime factors of 3 are 3.

Since there is only 1 prime factor, 2, that is common to both 4 and 3, the prime factor counting is 1.

Step 2: Addition and Subtraction (S)
Since this problem involves addition, we'll move on to the addition phase. However, we still need to add the result of the prime factor counting (which is a constant value of 1 in this case) to the second number 2.

2. Next, since there is neither multiplication nor division in this expression, we move on to addition and subtraction (AS):
   We have 2 operations in the order given: '+' and '#'. According to the order of operations given (PEFMDASC), we should perform concatenation (C) before addition (AS). However, in this case, both operations are different, so we cannot directly follow the order, and we should break the rule, as the expression uses addition and not concatenation.

3. So, we perform the addition (AS): 
   4 + 2 = 6

4. Now that we have the result of the addition, we perform the concatenation (C) operation:
    Since we added 2 and 4 to get 6, we have 6. However, according to the rules of concatenation given (there is no number '6' representation in the given examples), the digits of the numbers 4 and 3 are concatenated together, which is 43.

5. Finally, since there are no more operations left, the answer using the PEFMDASC order is: The answer is 43.

   4 # 3 = 1

2. Addition and Subtraction (S): After performing prime factor counting, we proceed to the addition operation. Since the ""+"" symbol in the expression comes before the ""#"" symbol, we perform addition. In this case, there are no numbers inside parentheses, so we apply it directly.

   The addition of 1 and 2 equals 3.

3. Concatenation (C): Lastly, we perform the concatenation operation (represented as ""@""). The ""@"" symbol is given last in the order of operations due to its lower precedence.

   Since there are no numbers inside parentheses and we have performed all other operations, the concatenation of 3 and 2 results in the combining of their digits. The digit 3 remains as it is, and the digit 2 becomes 2 in the result if we concatenate 3 and 2, the final answer is:

Concatenation does not affect prime factors since it simply joins the digits together, while addition does not change the prime factors of the given numbers.

Step 2: Concatenation (C):
Now, we proceed to the next operation in the order, which is concatenation (C). In the given expression, we have 4 and 3 as inputs. Since concatenation is a left-to-right operation, we simply join the digits from the leftmost input to the rightmost input. In this case, we have:

Since concatenation combines the digits of the numbers, the combined digits of 4 and 3 are: 43.

First, let's calculate the prime factor counting (#) for the given numbers 4 and 3.

The prime factors of 4 are 2, 2 (since 4=2²*2), and the prime factors of 3 are 3 (since 3 is a prime number itself).
There is one prime factor, 2, that appears in both sets, so the prime factor counting is 1.

Step 2: Addition (A)
Now that we have the prime factor counting, we can move on to the addition part of the expression: 4 # 3 + 2.
However, since we need to follow the PEFMDASC order, we cannot perform the addition before the prime factor counting.
Instead, we need to wait until the multiplication and division have been done.

So, the current calculation remains unchanged: The answer is 1 (prime factor counting) for 4 # 3 + 2.

1. Prime Factor Counting (F): Find the prime factor count for 4 and 3. Since there is no shared prime factor between them, the prime factor count is 0.
   Therefore, 4 # 3 = 0.

2. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): Perform the addition operation after the prime factor counting, which is 2 in this case.

First, we need to perform prime factor counting for the given numbers 4 and 3.

The prime factorization of 4 is 2 x 2 x 2 x 1 = 2^3. The prime factors of 3 are 3 and 1 from the given expression. Since there is no shared prime factor between 2^3 and 3, the result is 0 as per the definition.

Step 2: Addition and Subtraction (AS)
Since there is no addition sign before the concatenation operator (@), we presume there's an implicit addition sign before 4 which makes the given expression 4 + 3 or 3 + 4. We'll proceed with 3 + 4.

Step 3: Concatenation (C)
As per the order, we need to perform concatenation next. Since there's no operation to be performed on the numbers as such, let's just note down the sequence of numbers - 3 and 4.

Step 4: Addition and Subtraction (AS)
Now, we'll evaluate the addition part of our expression - 3 + 4 = 7

Step 5: Concatenation (C)
Finally, concatenate the result from step 4 with the original number 4. Concatenation of 7 and 4 yields 74 [Since addition comes before concatenation, we had 7 added to 4 not concatenated to form 74, and then concatenated]

1. The absolute values of 4 and 3 are 4 and 3 respectively.
2. The unique prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2 (since 4 = 2 * 2 * 1). The unique prime factors of 3 are 3.
3. There is only one prime factor, 2, shared between 2 and 3.
4. Therefore, 4 # 3 = 1.

1. According to the PEFMDASC order, we should perform concatenation (C) afterward, but since there is no concatenation symbol in the given expression, we proceed with this problem without worrying about C yet.

Since the operands of the concatenation operation ' @ ' are integers 5, 2 and 4. Prime factor count of 5, 2 and 4 are {2, 1, 2}, {2, 1} and {2, 2} respectively. The count of unique prime factors shared by any pair of numbers is the Intersection of their prime factor lists counted with multiplicity. Since Intersection of {2,1,2}, {2,1} and {2,2} is an empty set. Therefore, prime factor counting operation returns 0.
4. Multiplication and Division (M and D): None in the expression.
5. Addition and Subtraction (A and S): The expression contains only addition and concatenation operations. Since addition should be done before concatenation as per PESMDASC rule, we will perform the addition first.
6. Concatenation (C): The addition operation '+' between 5 and 2 gives us a result of 7. The concatenation operation '@' between 7 and 4 is then performed to get the final answer.

So, following the new order of operations, the expression 5 + 2 @ 4, is equal to:

The answer is 74.","To solve this problem using the new order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to first examine the given expression: 5 + 2 @ 4

The concatenation operation (C) involves joining the digits of two numbers. In this case, the concatenation is between the number 2 and the digits of the number 4.

First, since we're dealing with the digits of numbers, we need to apply the Concatenation operation before Addition. So, the expression changes to:

5 + 25 (since 2 @ 4 = 25)

Next, since Addition and Subtraction have the same precedence and are performed from left to right, we'll perform the Addition:

5 + 25 = 30.

Step 3: Perform Prime Factor Counting (F). In this problem, we don't have the values of 'a' and 'b' to perform Prime Factor Counting, so we move on to the next operation in the order.

Step 4: Multiply and divide from left to right (M/D). In this problem, we don't have any multiplication or division, so we move on to the next operation in the order.

Step 5: Add and subtract from left to right (A/S). Our first operation is @ which is concatenation and it comes after addition and subtraction in the given order of operations. Since there's no need to perform addition and subtraction currently, we move on to the next operation in the order.

Step 6: Perform the Concatenation (C). In this problem, we have '5 + 2@4'. The '@' symbol represents the Concatenation operation. We perform concatenation on the numbers that are right next to it, which are '2' and '4'. So, the operation becomes '5 + 2@4' -> '5 + 24'

 Prime factors of 5: 5
 Prime factors of 3: 2, 3
 Prime factors of 2: 2

Since there is no shared prime factor, the result of prime factor counting operation is 0.

Therefore, we need to evaluate addition operation before prime factor counting.

2. Addition (A): We need to add 5 and 3.
 The answer is 8.

But since there is a Concatenation (C) operation next in the order of operations, we need to apply it to the result 8.

Therefore, the prime factor count for 5 and 3 is 1, and the prime factor count for 5 and 2 is 0.

2. Addition (S): Perform the addition operation. Since we calculated 5 + 3#2 as the sum of 5 and 3 with the result of 3#2, which is 1 (since there's one shared prime factor between 5 and 3), the sum of 5 and 1 is 6.

3. However, prime factor counting (#) is an operation that only yields zeros or natural numbers as results. In this case, 5 and 3 share no common prime factors; hence, their prime factor counting is zero (0).

From the order of operations, we can see that prime factor counting (#) comes before addition (+), so we need to perform prime factor counting before addition.

Since we cannot perform Prime Factor Counting and Addition/Subtraction simultaneity, we need to follow the order strictly. In this case, since the # symbol precedes the + symbol, we need to perform Prime Factor Counting before Addition. Based on our calculations, Prime Factor Counting results in 0.

3 # 2 = 3 (since prime factors of 3 are 3, and prime factors of 2 are 2, there are no common prime factors between 3 and 2, which results in prime factor count of 0, hence the result is 3)

4. Perform the addition operation: Since 0 is considered to be less than any other number, we need to add the non-zero number (3) to 0 first: 3 + 0 = 3

The final answer: Since we did not get the chance to evaluate the concatenation operation, the result we have obtained (8) cannot serve as the final answer. In fact, performing concatenation with the result we have obtained will lead to an incorrect answer, as the problem does not contain any information about concatenating numbers.

Since # is an earlier operation in the updated order of operations (PEFMDASC), we need to perform the prime factor counting before any addition. In this case, we have 2 as the second operand for the # operation, but since both operands are positive, prime factors of 3 and 2 are 2 and 2 respectively. So, the prime factor counting operation yields a result of 2.

 Step 3: Perform Addition.
Now we can perform the addition operation, but we have to be careful since the operands aren't directly addable due to the result of the prime factor counting. In this step, we are actually performing concatenation as the ""+"" sign is used to represent concatenation in this context. Since the result of the prime factor counting operation is a number with a value of 2, we can concatenate it to the number 5 by writing it as 5_ (an underscore is used here to represent the separation caused by performing prime factor counting before concatenation).

Prime factors for 5 are 5, and prime factors for 3 and 2 are 2. Since there is no shared prime factor between the numbers 5, 3, and 2, the prime factor counting operation results in 0.

4. The '5' is an operand for the addition operation.

Under the PEFMDASC order, we first perform Prime Factor Counting (F) on the operands 3 and 2:

Instead, we include a placeholder '0' to the left of the number obtained in step 1, and perform concatenation on the digits of the resulting number.

2. Apply concatenation (C) to the result obtained from the above step and the number 6.
   Concatenation (C): 18 @ 6

3. The prime factor counting (F) operation cannot be applied yet, as there are no numbers for it to be operated on. Let's continue applying the other operations in the given order of operations.

4. Apply multiplication (M): Since there is no division in the current expression, we move directly to multiplication. The expression to operate is the result from step 2 and number 12.
   Multiplication (M): 6@18 * 12

5. Perform concatenation (C) operation on the multiplication result and the number -2.
   Concatenation (C): (6@18 * 12) @ -2

6. The first operation to perform is prime factor counting (F) since it comes before exponents (E) and the current expression doesn't have any exponents. We need to find the unique prime factors shared by the absolute values of the concatenation result and number 3.
   Since the concatenation result and number 3 are different, and neither has any common prime factors, their prime factorization is 0. This means there are no shared prime factors. Therefore, the result of the prime factor counting operation is 0.

7. Now that we have obtained the result of the prime factor counting operation, we can continue the order of operations as follows:

   Subtraction (S): Perform the subtraction between concatenation result (-2) and 0.
   Subtraction (S): -2 - 0 = -2

   Addition (A): (6@18 * 12 @ -2) + (-2)
   Addition (A): (6@18 * 12) @ 2 = (654 @ 2) = 6542

3. Prime Factor Counting (F): We don't have any prime factors to count yet, so we continue evaluating.
4. Multiplication and Division (M/D): We have @ (concatenation) and # (prime factor counting) symbols. However, since concatenation has higher precedence than prime factor counting, we first perform concatenation.

Step 1: Concatenate 6 and 18: Resolve the expression inside the parentheses (14 + 4 = 18) and concatenate the result and the '6' to get '618'.

Now that we have performed the concatenation, we step back to the prime factor counting operation (#):

5. Prime Factor Counting (F): Since there is no common prime factor for '6' and '-2', their prime factor counts are both 0. For '6' and '3', the common prime factors are 2 and 3. Since 3 is an odd prime and 2 is an even prime, they do not have common prime factors, and their prime factor counts are both 1. For '618' and '3', no common prime factors exist; their prime factor counts are both 0.

Using these counts, we can now evaluate the subtraction:

6. Subtraction (A/S): Subtract 2 from 12; the result is 10. Since the prime factor counts of 6, -2, and 3 are all 0, there are no carriers to change.

Thus, putting all the operations together in the correct order:

Step 2: Concatenate the result with the number 6 using the @ symbol.

= 186

Step 3: Perform the prime factor counting operation between the concatenated result and the number 3 using the # symbol.

= 0 (since the only primes in 186 are 2 and 3, but they don't appear together)

Step 4: Perform addition using the A/S rule.

Step 5: Perform subtraction using the A/S rule (since there is no addition in this part).

The answer is 184.","To solve the expression 6 @ (14+4) + 12 - 2#3, let's follow the stepped-up order of operations PEFMDASC:

1. Parentheses: Solve the expression inside the parentheses:

2. Exponents: No exponent term present (skip this step)

3. Prime factor counting:
   For 6: Prime factors are 2, 3.
   For 18: Prime factors are 2, 2, 3.
   Since 2 and 3 are the unique shared prime factors between the absolute values of 6 and 18, the prime factor count is 2.

4. Multiplication and Division (left to right):
   Multiply the results of the previous prime factor counting step (the prime factor count) and the result of the operation before the multiplication sign:
   2 * 18 = 36

5. Addition and Subtraction (left to right):
   Perform addition before subtraction:
   Starting from the leftmost term, we have 6 @ 18 + 12, so with the order of operations, we must first perform the concatenation operation on 6 and 18:
   The result of 6 @ 18 is 618
   Add 12 to the result: 618 + 12 = 629

6. Concatenation:
   Perform concatenation operation on the results of the previous addition operation and the number before the concatenation sign:
   629 (from the previous step) @ 2 = 6292

7. Subtraction:
   Perform the subtraction operation at the end:
   Starting from the rightmost term, we have 6292 - 3, so subtract 3 from 6292:

 Step 3: Prime Factor counting (F)
 6 # 18 = 2 # 2 * 3 * 3 = 2 # 18 = 2 (since there is only 1 prime factor 2 that appears in both 6 and 18)

 Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
 We cannot perform multiplication and division yet since we only have one multiplication sign and no division sign.

 Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
 Let's handle the subtraction now, following the left-to-right rule.
 12 - 2 = 10

1. a = 18
2. b = 6
3. c = 14 (from parentheses)
4. d = 4

a # c = 1 (There is only 1 shared prime factor 2 between 18 and 14, while the others are 2, 3, and 3 for 18 and 2 for 14)

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (F)
To calculate the prime factor counting (F), we need to find the common prime factors of |6| and |18|, which are 2 and 3. Since there are 2 unique shared prime factors, the prime factor count is 2.

a) Evaluate 6 @ 18
Since we need to evaluate addition before concatenation, we'll first calculate 18 + 6 = 24.

b) Now, we can perform the concatenation: 6 @ 24 = 624.

c) Now, let's evaluate subtraction: 12 - 2 = 10.

Since we've completed all other operations, we can now perform the prime factor counting between |6| and |3|, but they were already provided in the problem: |6| = 2 × 2 × 3 and |3| = 3. Since they share the prime factor 3, the prime factor count is 1.

   - For 6 and 18: Prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, prime factors of 18 are 2, 3, and 3. There are two 3's shared, so the prime factor counting is 2.

   - For 18 and 3: Prime factors of 18 are 2, 3, and 3; prime factors of 3 are 3. They don't share any prime factors, so the prime factor counting is 0.

3. Prime Factor Counting: Let's find shared prime factors between each pair, but for now, focus on the pairs that don't involve concatenation since it comes last.

a. Between 18 and 6, there are no common prime factors, so 18 # 6 = 0
b. Between 18 and 12, prime factors for 18 are 2, 2, 3, 3, and for 12, prime factors are 2, 2, and 3. Only the prime factor 2 is common, so 18 # 12 = 2.

2. Exponents: None, so we move to the next operation.

3. Prime Factor Counting:

   a) For 18 and 6, no common prime factors. So, the answer is 0.
   b) For 18 and 3, the prime factors of 18 are 2, 3, and 3. The prime factors of 3 are 3. Since there is only one 3, the answer is 1.
   c) For 6 and 2, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. The prime factors of 2 are 2. Since both numbers share only one prime factor, the answer is 1.

4. Multiplication and Division (from left to right):

   a) Multiply 6 @ 18: With new operations coming before addition or subtraction, we first concatenate 6 and 1 (result is 61) and then concatenate 61 and 18. The final result is 6118.
   b) Perform prime factor counting with this result and 3, which we calculated as having a result of 1 earlier. We examined their absolute values, so we take the absolute value of the result, which is 1.

Step 1: Parentheses
The parentheses contain the expression 14 + 4. Let's evaluate this expression first:

14 + 4 = 18

Step 2: Exponents (none present)

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (6 @ (18) and # 3)
Now let's calculate the prime factor counting for the given expressions:

For 6 @ (18): Since we cannot perform concatenation on an expression and a number, first we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses, i.e., 18. Since we already have the result from step 1, we have: 18
Now we perform concatenation on 6 and 18: 6 @ 18 = 618

For # 3: Since one of the numbers is 3, a prime number, the prime factor counting will be 1.

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (left to right)
Since there're no multiplication or division operations present, we move on to the next step.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
We now have three addition and/or subtraction operations to deal with: + and - in the problem and + after the concatenation result in the previous step. We'll perform these from left to right.

For the first addition: 618 + 12 = 630

For the last subtraction: 630 - 2 = 628

Step 6: Concatenation (left to right)
We only have one concatenation operation (630 @ 1), but since we've already evaluated it in step 3, the result is: 6301

However, since there's a prime factor counting operation (# 3) after the concatenation, we need to recalculate the result, applying prime factor counting after the concatenation:

Since the numbers to be concatenated are 630 and 1, let's calculate the prime factor counting for both numbers first:

For 630: Prime factors are 2 (three times), 3 (thirteen times), and 5 (two times).
For 1: Prime factor is 1. Since it's a single prime factor, the prime factor counting result is 1.

Now, applying the prime factor counting operation after concatenation: Since there's only one shared prime factor (1) between 630 and 1, the prime factor counting result is 0.

Since concatenation is the last operation and we've done it already, the result is the final answer:

The answer is 6301 (with a prime factor counting of 0).

Note: After evaluating the expressions that use the new operations, keep in mind to check for prime factor counting with the numbers","Step 1: Parentheses
The first step in the PEFMDASC order is to deal with any expressions inside parentheses. In this problem, we have (14 + 4). So, let's calculate that first:

14 + 4 = 18

Step 2: Prime factor counting (#)
The second step is prime factor counting (#). However, since the given numbers are in the range of small integers, it is easy to see that none of the numbers have common prime factors. So, prime factor counting will result in 0 for each calculation. In other cases, you should calculate the unique prime factors of the absolute values and count their occurrences to find the result. In this case, since the result of each step is 0, we can easily move on to the next step.

Step 3: Exponents (No exponents in this problem)

Step 4: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
No multiplication or division operations are present in this problem.

Step 5: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
We now have addition and subtraction operations: 6 @ (18) + 12 - 2. Since addition comes before subtraction:

Step 6: Addition (A)
6 + (18) = 24

   Similarly, 6 has prime factors 2 and 3, and 2 is a shared prime factor between 6 and 6, so the result of 6 # 6 is 2.

2. Addition (A):

a) 8 # 2 = 2 (since 2 is the only prime factor both numbers have)
b) 2 # 6 = 1 (only one prime factor, 2, is common to both 2 and 6)

Next comes addition and subtraction (AS): We combine the numbers after evaluating Prime Factor Counting.

3 + 6 = 9

1. The prime factor counting operations result is 1 (from 8 # 2) + 0 (from 6 # 6) = 1

Now, we'll handle the concatenation operation:

2. The result of 1 @ 6 is simply 16 (since '1' is concatenated with the digit string '6').

Lastly, we'll handle the addition operation:

1. Since the addition operation involves two digits, we need to perform it after concatenation based on the left-to-right rule. Therefore, the sum of the digits 8 and 6 is 14.

(i) Prime Factor Counting (F):

First, let us find the prime factors of each number:

8 # 2 = 1 (as determined in the prime factor counting)
6 # 6 = 3 (as determined in the prime factor counting)

2 = 2

6 = 2 * 3 = 2⁴ (Two instances of prime factor 2 and one instance of prime factor 3)

First, we solve the prime factor counting (F) part:
- For 8, its prime factors are 2 × 2 × 2.
- For 2, its prime factors are 2.

First, we calculate the prime factor counts for each number:
8 = 2^3, 2 # 8 = 3
2 is not a prime number, so its prime factors are 2 and 2 = 2, and since we're looking for unique prime factors in the shared count, we have 1 prime factor in common, i.e., a prime factor count of 1 for both numbers.

Next is the concatenation operation. However, concatenation should be done only after addition has been completed. Company policy states that the addition in this problem must be done first. Thus, to comply, we will carry out the addition operation before concatenation.

Now, we perform the addition: 6 # 2 = 1, 1 + 6 = 7.

Answer: 0.","The solution to this problem using the updated mathematical operations and the new order of operations (PEFMDASC) would be:

First, we perform the prime factor counting (#) operation for both numbers on the left side of the addition sign:

1. 8 # 2
Since there's no common prime factor between 8 and 2, the result is 0.

2. 6 # 6
Both numbers 6 and 6 have the common prime factor 2, so the result of this operation is 1.

Now that we have determined the outcome of the prime factor counting (#) operation, we move on to the next step during the order of operations, which is multiplication and division (M/D): There's no division involved; therefore, multiplication comes next:

0 (from the # operation) * 6 = 0

However, since there's an addition sign, we move on to the next operation in the order which is Addition and Subtraction (A/S):

0 + 6 = 6

   - 8 # 2 = 2 (since 2 and 2 have 1 shared prime factor)
   - 6 # 6 = 2 (since 2 and 6 have 2 shared prime factors: 2 and 2)
3. Now, we evaluate the addition operation (+) with the result of the prime factor counting operations:

5. Addition and Subtraction (A/S): We have addition operations between the expressions 8 # 2 and 6 # 6.
6. Concatenation (C): We don't have any concatenation operations between the expressions, but we should perform any concatenations last since it is the last operation in the order of operations.

First, we calculate the prime factor counting for each number:

2 = 2

6 = 2² * 2 * 3

Now we have 2 common prime factors - 2, so the prime factor counting result is 2.

Next, we move on to multiplication and division (M/D). Since there are no division signs, we only have multiplication. We follow the left-to-right rule and perform the multiplication:

2 (prime factor counting) * 2² (power) * 2 * 3

The prime factors of 6 are 2, 3, and 3. Since there is no common prime factor between 6 and 2, the result of prime factor counting for 6 and 2 is 0.

Now, since concatenation (C) is performed last, we can skip it for now and move on to multiplication and division (M/D) since there is multiplication in the problem.

We need to evaluate the operations within the parentheses first (P), so we focus on 2 + 6:

2 + 6 = 8

Now, our problem is reduced to 8 # 8.

The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2, 2. Since these factors are repeated, the prime factor counting for 8#8 is equal to the number of repeated factors, which is 4.

So, we have 0 (from prime factor counting of 8 and 2) + 8 (from performing the addition within the parentheses) + 4 (from prime factor counting of 8#8).

The answer is 12.","To solve the problem 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the updated order of operations, we need to first perform the prime factor counting (#) between the given numbers and then do the addition (A) afterward.

Now we perform concatenation (C) on the last term 6#6.
Since 6 is a positive number:
1#6 = 0 because there's no common prime factor (no shared prime factors between 1 and 6).

3. Addition and Subtraction (AS): Calculate addition and subtraction in the order they appear, left to right.

   First, let's find the prime factor counting result for the whole expression. Since prime factor counting is an operation that calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of the numbers, we can combine the numbers together and then calculate the prime factor count.

   Combined expression: 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = (8 @ 2) @ 6 @ 6

   First, we calculate the concatenation of the numbers inside each set of parentheses:

   8 @ 2 = 82
   6 @ 6 = 66

   Now, we calculate the prime factor count for each concatenated result:

   82: Values: 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2; Prime Factor Count: 6
   66: Values: 2, 3, 11; Prime Factor Count: 3

   Since we are adding the results of prime factor counting, we need to add the prime factor counts: 6 + 3 = 9.

   The answer is 9.","To solve the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the new order of operations PEFMDASC, follow these steps:

1. Prime factor counting (F): Find the prime factor count of each pair of numbers and perform the operation.

   For the first term, 8 # 2:
   Prime factors of 8: 2, 2, 2, 2
   Prime factors of 2: 2
   Count: Number of unique prime factors = 1
   So, 8 # 2 = 1

   For the second term, 6 # 6:
   Prime factors of 6: 2, 3
   Prime factors of 6: 2, 3
   Count: Number of unique prime factors = 2
   So, 6 # 6 = 2

2. Addition (A): Perform addition operation on the results of the prime factor counting steps.

   The result of 8 # 2 is 1, and the result of 6 # 6 is 2. Perform the addition: 1 + 2 = 3

2. Exponents (E):

3. Multiplication and Division (M/D):

5. Concatenation (C):
Evaluate concatenation from left to right:
- 6 # 6 = 6
- 2 + 6 = 8

So, the expression becomes 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 = 3 # 2 + 6.
The prime factor count for 2 is 1, and for 6 is 3. Since there is only one unique prime factor (2) shared between 2 and 3, the prime factor count is 1.

Since there is no operation between the two groups in the expression, we can treat the whole expression as a single prime factor counting operation with a total count of 5.

 For the first term, 8, the prime factorization is 2³ × 2. The unique prime factors are {2, 2}. For the second term, 2, it's already prime, so the unique prime factor is {2}.

 Now, let's compare the prime factors: there is only 1 common prime factor, which is 2. So, 8 # 2 = 1.

2. Multiplication/Division: None present, so we move on to the next operation.

   Therefore, the count of unique prime factors for 8 is 4 (denoted as 4 here instead of the symbol # for better understanding).

   b = 2
   Prime factors of 2: 2
   Therefore, the count of unique prime factors for 2 is 1.

   c = 6
   Prime factors of 6: 2, 2, 3
   Therefore, the count of unique prime factors for 6 is 3.

2. Now, calculate prime factor counts for expressions with the symbol @ and #:

   a # (b + c)

   The prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2, 2 (4 times). The prime factors common to the two numbers we're comparing are 2. Therefore, the prime factor count here is:

The addition of 6 and 0 is 6, and 6 # 6 equals 1 (as previously calculated). So, we have 1 @ 6 + 6 = 1 @ 12 = 12 (since there is no prime factor count operation between concatenation and addition).

   a) For 8 # 2: Prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2, and 2, i.e., four 2s. Prime factors of 2 are all 2, so the number of unique shared prime factors between 8 and 2 is 1.

To find the prime factor count between each pair of numbers, we need to first find the absolute values of the given numbers:

The given expression is 8 # 2 + 6 # 6
Absolutely, we have: |8| = 8 and |2| = 2, |6| = 6

Now, we can calculate the prime factor count:
8 # 2 = 4 (two occurs twice in the prime factorization of 8)
2 # 6 = 1 (both 2 and 6 only have a prime factor 2 in common, and since it's the same prime factor, the prime factor count is 1)
6 # 6 = 2 (each number has a prime factor 2 twice, so the prime factor count is 2)

Step 2: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Next, we need to do the addition and subtraction using the new order:

8 # 2 = 4
2 # 6 = 1
6 # 6 = 2

4 + 1 + 2 = 7

So, the prime factor count for 8 and 2 is 1, and the prime factor count for 6 occurs twice, so the prime factor count for 6 and 6 is 2. The sum of these prime factor count numbers is 7.

Step 3.1: 6 # 6
The prime factorization of 6 => 2 ^ 2 * 3, with unique prime factors 2 and 3. For 6, we have repeating prime factors, so the prime factor count is still 2 (since counting 2 as a unique prime factor). Thus, 6 # 6 = 2.

Now, moving to Step 3.2:

Step 3.2: 8 # 2
Prime factorization of 8 => 2 ^ 3, prime factors of 2. Since there's only one prime factor shared (in this case, 2), 8 # 2 = 1.

Since the symbol ""+"" in the expression does not represent concatenation, this step does not apply.

3. Perform prime factor counting (F): Let's find common prime factors for the absolute values of 8 and 2 (2 and 8) and 6 and 6 (both 2 and 3). Prime factors of 2 are common in both pairs, so their count is 1.
   - For 8 and 2: 8 # 2 = 1
   - For 6 and 6: 6 # 6 = 1
4. Perform division and multiplication from left to right (M/D): In this expression, there is no division or multiplication.
5. Perform addition and subtraction from left to right (A/S): In this expression, there are two concatenation operations, but we cannot perform them yet as we still need to complete addition and subtraction. So, let's just move to the next step.
    - There is no addition or subtraction in this expression.
6. Perform concatenation from left to right (C): Now, we can perform the concatenation operations.
   - For 8 # 2: The result of prime factor counting is 1, which does not affect the concatenation of the digits. So, the result is 8 @ 2 = 82.
   - For 6 # 6: The result of prime factor counting is 1, which also does not affect the concatenation of the digits. So, the result is 6 @ 6 = 66.
7. Combine the results: Since we cannot perform addition between these results directly (we must follow the order), just combine the results and leave the addition for the next step. The combined result is 82 and 66.
8. Perform addition and subtraction from left to right (A/S): Now, we can perform the addition operation.
   - For 82 and 66: Add the digits one by one in the sequences.
      - Carry over 2 from the addition of 2 and 1, making it 3.
      - Add 6 and 2, making it 8.
      - Add 6 and 8, making it 14. With carries, it becomes 15.
      - Subtract 1 (the number of common leading digits) from the final carry number (which is 1), giving us 0.
9. Adjust the last step if necessary depending on the number of leading zeroes. Since there are no leading zeroes in our result (15), no adjustments are needed.

Therefore, the answer is 8266.","To calculate the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the PEFMDASC order, follow these steps:

Step 1: Prime Factor Counting
First, we need to perform the prime factor counting operation for each pair of numbers. So, let's look at the prime factorization of 8, 2, 6, and 6.

8 = 2³ * 2
2 = 2
6 = 2⁵

Since 8 and 2 do not share any prime factors, their prime factor counting operation will be 0. Similarly, 6 and 6 also do not share any prime factors, so their prime factor counting operation will be 0.

Step 2: Addition
Now, having the prime factor counting results, we can move on to the addition operation. Since we follow the left to right rule for the Addition and Subtraction (A/S), we'll perform the addition from left to right.

8 # (2 + 6)

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting
Perform the prime factor counting operation for 2 and 6. Since they don't share any prime factors, the result will be 0.

8 # (2 + 6) = 8 # (8)

Step 4: Multiplication
Now, since Multiplication should be done before Addition as per the PEFMDASC order, we'll perform the multiplication of the concatenation result 8 with the result of the addition operation 8.

The answer is: 8 # (2 + 6) = 8 # 8 = 64.",1,8266,64,5,8#2+6#6,3,0,0,0
mistral-7b-instruct,1,8#2+6#6,4,17,"Step 1: Prime factor counting (F)
To find the unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of |8| and |2|, and |6| and |6|:

For |8| (the absolute value of 8), prime factors are 2, 2, 2, and 2 (since 8 = 2³ * 2) -> # of unique prime factors is 1 (since 2 is the only prime factor).

For |2|, prime factors are 2 (since 2 = 2).

For |6|, prime factors are 2 and 3 (since 6 = 2 * 3²).

Since the prime factor 2 is shared between |8| and |6|, the value of 8 # 6 is 1.

Step 2: Multiplication and Division (M/D)
Now we have the values of 8#2 and 6#6; we can evaluate the multiplication:

1 * 36 (since 6#6 = 36)

Step 3: Addition and Subtraction (A/S)
Now we have the values of 1 and 36, we can evaluate the addition:

1 + 36

Step 4: Concatenation (C)
Since there are no parentheses, exponents, or other operations that need to be evaluated, the final step is concatenation:

The answer is 137.","To solve the expression 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the PEFMDASC order, follow these steps:

1. Prime Factor Counting (#):
  Calculate the prime factor counts for each pair of numbers:

  b) For 6 and 6: 6 has the prime factors 2 and 3, while 6 has the prime factors 2 and 3; the common prime factors are 2 and 3.
  
2. Multiply or Divide (M/D):
  Since we don't have a division operation in this step, skip this step.

3. Prime Factor Counting (F):
  We have already calculated the prime factor counts, so we can simply use the results from step 1: 1 for the first expression, and 2 and 3 for the second expression.

4. Exponents (E):
  Since we don't have any exponents, we skip this step.

5. Multiplication or Division (M/D):
  Since we didn't perform any multiplication or division in previous steps, we skip this step as well.

6. Addition or Subtraction (A/S):
  Add the results of the first prime factor counts: 1 + 2 = 3 (since concatenation comes next and will change the value of the sum).

7. Concatenation (C):
  In this step, we concatenate both sum results: 3 (from step 6) and the result of 2 and 3 (from step 3) as the final result, following the left-to-right rule: 3 __________ 23

The answer is 323.","To solve the problem 8 # 2 + 6 # 6 using the updated order of operations PEFMDASC, we follow these steps:

For 2: 2^1 (2 as prime factor multiplicity is 1)

For 6: 2^1, 3^1 (2 and 3 as prime factors each with multiplicity 1)

Since the only shared prime factor is 2, the prime factor counting is 2.

2. Multiplication and Division (MD):
We do not have any multiplication or division operations in our current expression, so we move on to the next step.

3. Addition and Subtraction (AS):
We need to evaluate the addition operations + inside the # signs.

The expression becomes: 8 # (2 + 6)

4. Concatenation (C):
Since we have an addition operation inside # symbols, we perform that step first, not concatenation. However, since there are no parentheses involved, we can still proceed as follows.

We have 2 + 6 = 8, as 4+2=6+2=8.

So, now our expression is: 8 # 8

5. Multiplication and Division (MD):
Now, since there are no multiplication or division operations left, we move directly to the next operation.

6. Prime Factor counting (F):
As we have already calculated the prime factor counting earlier for 8, we have it as a reference. The only shared prime factor between 8 and 8 is 2, so the prime factor counting is 2.

7. Exponents (E):
There are no exponents in our given expression, so we move to the next operation.

8. Concatenation (C):
Now, we perform concatenation operation. Concatenating 2 (the result of prime factor counting) and 2 (from the previous step), we get 22 as our final answer.

Let's begin by finding the prime factor counts for each expression:

a) 8 # 2
The absolute values of a and b are |8| = 8 and |2| = 2.
The unique prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2, while those of 2 are 2.
Since there is only one prime factor 2 that is shared, the prime factor count is 1.

b) 6 # 6
The absolute values of a and b are |6| = 6 and |6| = 6.
The unique prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, while those of 6 are 2 and 2.
Since there are two shared prime factors 2, the prime factor count is 2.

Add the results of prime factor counts determined in Step 1:

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (#) - Input b
Since we count the unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of a and b, we only have one 2 as a common prime factor. So, 8 # 2 = 1.

Step 3: Prime Factor Counting (#) - Input c
Since neither 2 nor 6 share any unique prime factors, 8 # 6 = 0.

2. No other common prime factors exist.

Since there is 1 shared prime factor, the result of performing 8 # 6 will be 1.

   In this case, we have 3 # 2. So we need to find the prime factors of |3| and |2| first, which are 3 and 2 respectively. Then we look for shared prime factors between them and count how many there are. In this case, 3 and 2 have no shared prime factors, so the count is 0.

4. Perform Multiplication and Division (if any) from left to right, and then Addition and Subtraction (if any) from left to right: However, in this problem, since there are no multiplication, division, addition, or subtraction between the prime factor counting, we don't need to do steps 4-6 anymore.
5. Perform Concatenation (C) from left to right: There are no other concatenation operations left in the expression.

The answer is 5 + 3 # 2 = 5 + 0 = 5.","Let's solve the problem using the revised order of operations, PEFMDASC.

5 + 3 # 2

First, we should note that there are no parentheses or exponents in this expression, so we can skip those steps and move on to the prime factor counting (F).

Unfortunately, we cannot apply the prime factor counting operation, because it requires two numbers as operands, and currently both operands (3 and 2) are integers, not an operation. This expression seems to omit the prime factor counting operation. It can be assumed that the original expression is either ""5 + (3 # 2)"" or ""(5+3) # 2"", to ensure the correct placement of the prime factor counting operation.

Updated Order of Operations with New Operations

The field of mathematics has evolved with the introduction of two new operations, concatenation (C) and prime factor counting (F), and as a result, the order of operations has been updated to PEFMDASC. This article presents examples that illustrate the application of these new operations and their placement in the revised order of operations.

Concatenation (C)
Concatenation is denoted by @ and represents the operation of joining the digits of two numbers together. When using concatenation, one does not consider the signs of the numbers involved, and instead focuses on the absolute values. Here are some examples:

* If a = 12 and b = 56, then a @ b = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
* If a = 12 and b = -56, then a @ b = |a| @ |b| = |12| @ |-56| = 12 @ 56 = 1256.
* If a = 0 and b = 24, then a @ b = 0 @ 24 = 024 = 24.

Prime Factor Counting (F)
Prime Factor Counting is denoted by # and calculates the count of unique prime factors shared between the absolute values of two numbers. Here are some examples:

* If a = 12 and b = 56, then a # b = 12 # 56 = 1, since the prime factors of 12 are 2 and 3, and the prime factors of 56 are 2 and 7, resulting in one shared prime factor, 2.
* If a = -16 and b = 4, then a # b = |a| # |b| = |-16| # |4| = 16 # 4 = 1, since the prime factors of 16 are 2 and the prime factors of 4 are 2 and 5, resulting in one shared prime","Let's solve the problem step by step using the PEFMDASC order of operations:

1. **Exponents:** There are no exponents in this expression.

So we move to the next step.

1. **Prime Factor counting (F):** Evaluate the shared prime factors between 6 @ 18 and 2 in 2 # 3. We don't know the result of 6 @ 18 yet, so let's calculate that first.

1. **Concatenation (C):** Perform the concatenation operation first because it is higher in the order of operations. Concatenate 6 with 18: 6 @ 18 = 618.

Now, we move back to step 3 and do the Prime Factor counting (F).

1. **Prime Factor counting (F):** Count the unique prime factors shared between 618 and 2. Since 618 is not a prime number, it doesn't reshare a factor with 2. So, 618 # 2 = 0 (no shared prime factor).

Now, we move to the next step.

1. **Multiplication and Division (MD):** Neither are present in this expression.

1. **Addition and Subtraction (AS):** Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.

618 + 12 - 2 # 3 = 630 - 2 # 3 (from left to right). Now, perform the subtraction operation first.

Step 2: Prime Factor Counting (F)
Calculate the Prime Factor Counting of -2 and 3, denoted as 2 # 3.

Next, we handle Concatenation (C), which is denoted by @:
But we need to remember that Concatenation operates on two numbers without any consideration of their values e.g., 6 @ 18 becomes 618.

So, the expression becomes: 618 + 12 - 2 # 3

Next, we handle Prime Factor counting (F), which is denoted by #:
However, in this particular case, we can't perform the Prime Factor counting operation yet because we don't have any numbers that are either multiplied or divided together. We'll have to wait until we perform those operations.

630 - 2 = 628
